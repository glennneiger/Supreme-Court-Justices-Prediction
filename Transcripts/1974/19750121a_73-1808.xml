            <text syncTime="16.126" offset="167894">Mr. Smith before you proceed let me announce that through Mr. Justice David Marshall is unavoidably delayed in getting here due to the weather conditions of the roads and he will participate in the case on the basis of the tapes up to the time that he actually arrives.</text>

            <text syncTime="39.895" offset="262980">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.311" offset="276668">These two cases which have been consolidated come here on writs of certiorari from the United States Courts of Appeals for the Sixth and Second Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.517" offset="321390">They present a procedural issue under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 that is whether the Commission of Internal Revenue is required to issue a notice of deficiency in connection with his termination of a taxpayer's taxable year pursuant to that authority granted him by Section 6851 of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.870" offset="430895">The Courts of Appeals have divided on this question with the Second Circuit in the Laing case holding that the Commissioner is not so required to issue a notice and the Sixth Circuit holding that the Commissioner is required to issue such a notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.507" offset="501426">In our view, the Sixth Circuit in imposing such a requirement on the Commissioner has erroneously merged two different statutory provisions of the Code, determination provision Section 6851 and an early assessment provision which is presently set out in Section 6861 of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.844" offset="602781">The significance of the way this case has arise and the significance of the issue for purposes of these cases is that if the Commissioner is not so required to issue a notice of deficiency in connection with a termination case as we submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.683" offset="666102">The parties have agreed that these suits are barred by the Anti-Injunction Act, a long-standing statute which Congress enacted over a hundred years ago which prohibits suits to enjoin the collection and assessment of taxes by any person in any court.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="171.358" offset="788773">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.417" offset="793057">At the outset, I think the Court should bear in mind an important historical fact about how our present system of tax litigation has developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.249" offset="832345">The Tax Court which was established by Congress as the Board of Tax Appeals only in 1924 and the United States Government has been collecting taxes for more than a hundred years.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.115" offset="891800">Now for over -- for perhaps the last 125 years, the Treasury has been empowered to assess and collect certain taxes like excise taxes prior to the time they are due to be paid just the way the termination provision works here with respect to income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.295" offset="972570">Now coupled with the Anti-Injunction Act, a taxpayer subject to a termination or excise taxes cannot bring a suit to enjoin the collection of those taxes and because of Congress' decision that excise taxes are not adjudicable in the Board of Tax Appeals but only in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.736" offset="1066297">The taxpayers are limited to a refund suit of the amount collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.198" offset="1088136">Now, we think that the issue here represents very much the same sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.162" offset="1107989">A congressional decision very much like the congressional decision to limit the jurisdiction of the Tax Court to income, estate, and gift taxes that there has been a congressional decision here which the statutory history demonstrates not to permit the Tax Court to review assessments made by the Commissioner in connection with a terminated taxable period.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.482" offset="1205269">In fact, that is still the law today with respect to excise taxes as Section 6862 of the Code so provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.491" offset="1237347">Now, the facts are in the cases are somewhat parallel and are undisputed and can be stated briefly as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.746" offset="1266395">In the Laing case 73-1808, the taxpayer Laing is a citizen of New Zealand.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.203" offset="1300146">In May of 1972, he entered the United States from Canada on a temporary visitor's visa.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.746" offset="1330343">In late June, he was traveling with two companions in a rented automobile from Northern United States in Vermont and attempting to get into Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.252" offset="1376423">Because the Canadian officials were dissatisfied with the identification proffered by one of the passengers they were refused entry into Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.697" offset="1418115">They then turned around and returned to the United States and was stopped by United States customs officials at Derby Line, Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.606" offset="1461791">Upon the search of the vehicle in which they were traveling, the customs officials found concealed in the engine compartment of their car suitcase containing more than $300,000.00 in the United States currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.423" offset="1513096">Now, once this discovery was made by the customs officials they in turn notified the District Director of Internal Revenue in Burlington, Vermont and once having received the information the District Director terminated the taxable years of all three people in the car pursuant to his authority under Section 6851 of the Code, one of the statute here which was employed in both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.387" offset="1628871">Assessments were then made against each individual in an amount of approximately $195,000.00 for this terminated period.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.572" offset="1669622">That is January 1, 1972 until June 24, 1972, the day that the discovery of the cash was ascertained by the customs officials.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="404.382" offset="1720926">Does the record show how that figure was arrived at?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="407.392" stopTime="497.414">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="407.392" offset="1732942">The record does not show how the figure was arrived at but perhaps I can help the Court with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.212" offset="1764185">Apparently what was done was taxpayer, that is Laing and his two companions were subjected to a net worth plus non-deductible expenditures computation.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.729" offset="1826252">That is they were asked as to -- Laing was asked as to how long he was in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.572" offset="1849657">It turned out to be some 20 or 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.803" offset="1862614">The District Director then made a computation based on his living expenses for that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.255" offset="1892394">In turn the value of the cash on the person's was also included as part of the net worth and an income figure was arrived at the sum I think $315,000.00 or so.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.295" offset="1972537">There was also a quantity of a hashish found on the person of Laing which was valued at a certain retail value and once that an income, of course income figure was arrived at, then the Internal Revenue Service gave each taxpayer, each person in the car credit for the standard deduction and a personal exemption and then a resulting taxable income figure was arrived at upon which the tax is computed.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.490" offset="2081311">It turned out to be something like $195,000.00.</text>

          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="497.414" stopTime="502.633">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="497.414" offset="2093014">Mr. Smith, would you assume that I asked the same question when you cover the Hall case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="502.633" stopTime="582.186">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="502.633" offset="2113912">Yes, I shall and I will be glad to elaborate on that also that the record with similarly silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.977" offset="2143274">Now, the assessments were then made in the amount of $195,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.196" offset="2168142">Now, Laing and his two companions refused to pay this tax so once having an assessment, the Commissioner exercised his collection powers which are also well settled in the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.760" offset="2226448">Section 6331 provides for levy and restraint power to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and as a result since the tangible property that is the cash was available, the Internal Revenue Service levied upon this cash that was found hidden in the engine compartment in the suitcase.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.629" offset="2313906">Now, three or four months later then, Laing commenced this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.889" offset="2330937">In the United States District Court of the District of Vermont seeking to enjoin the Commissioner's assessment and collection of these taxes and prohibiting his continued possession of his money.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.719" offset="2378271">Now, the Government defended this suit on the grounds of the Anti-Injunction Act which prohibits this kind of injunctive suits for assessment of collection of taxes.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="582.186" stopTime="589.337">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="582.186" offset="2432084">Well, the relief he sought then in the District Court was not simply to require you to issue a deficiency notice but actually return them?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="589.337" stopTime="621.102">

            <text syncTime="589.337" offset="2460714">No the -- yes, the relief he has sought was to enjoin the services continued possession of this money and to return it to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.807" offset="2506585">There was no attempt to -- although some of this case has involve that kind of relief, these cases involve simply a question of you know, the relief sought by the taxpayer is to prohibit the continued possession by the Internal Revenue Service of the money levied upon.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="622.277" offset="2592475">Because -- yes, and the ground that the taxpayers urge is that the Commissioner has not issued a notice of deficiency in this case then the Anti-Injunction Act does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.369" offset="2652871">Now the District Court in Laing dismissed the taxpayer's action and on an appeal to the Second Circuit that Court affirmed on the authority of its previous decision in the Irving case.</text>

            <text syncTime="655.016" offset="2723401">Had this been a jeopardy assessment after the conclusion of the taxable year, a deficiency notice would be issued even after assessment, wouldn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="669.516" offset="2781393">And does this mean that with a jeopardy assessment that one may then go to the Tax Court even though the assets have been levied upon?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="680.109" offset="2823816">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.879" offset="2826846">I mean that's what the statute that -- once you have a jeopardy assessment with the respect to a full taxable year which we submit involves an entirely different statutory provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.709" offset="2870209">Section 6861 (b) provides that the Commissioner shall issue a notice of deficiency within 60 days with the making of the assessment if he hasn't already done so.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="702.562" offset="2913573">Well, that being the case how would the Government be heard by a ruling that in the event of a termination as distinguished from a jeopardy assessment a notice of deficiency could be issued after the fact enabling the taxpayer to go to the Tax Court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="721.147" stopTime="847.883">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="721.147" offset="2987969">Well, I think that the best way to answer that question is to simply say that the Government has taken the position in these cases that Congress has made a decision that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue need not issue a deficiency notice in connection with a termination of a taxable year simply because Congress has made the other decision in allocating the jurisdiction of the various courts which hear a tax dispute that the Tax Court is not empowered to hear suits involving terminations of taxable years.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.269" offset="3136449">I think the Commissioner has preceded on that basis since this termination statute was enacted in Revenue Act of 1918 and as we pointed out in our petition in the Hall case there is some 70 cases now pending in the courts and an additional hundred of cases now pending administratively which involved this issue where the Commissioner has taken the consistent position that he need not issue a notice of deficiency and I suppose that the Government would be heard in the sense that those assessments the validity and propriety of those assessments would be put at issue if the Commissioner was deemed to have to issue a notice of deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.912" offset="3327039">And all the Commissioner is saying here is that, it has filed what it thinks -- he has filed what he thinks is the congressional decision then he need not issue such a notice of deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.223" offset="3368312">I think that the point is here that the review in the Tax Court of these kinds of termination actions does not particularly disadvantaged taxpayers while some of the courts which you held that the Commissioner must issue a notice of deficiency, I think were prompted by what they thought was serious questions of unfairness by not providing immediate access to the Tax Court but --</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="847.883" offset="3494954">Well, the Commissioner's position then of course raises the constitutional issue.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="851.936" offset="3511150">The Commissioner's position raises the constitutional issue, although I think as we pointed out in our brief, not only do we think that the statutory history demonstrates the existence of that kind of congressional decision to allocate jurisdiction in the termination case not to the Tax Court but to the District Courts but that in fact the constitution -- that decision, that congressional decision doesn't pose any serious constitutional problems because of the existence of an adequate remedy in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.268" offset="3644479">Now the -- so the Second Circuit has held that the Government is correct in its contention that the Commissioner need not issue a notice of deficiency in connection with this termination cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.492" offset="3701321">Now, the facts on the Hall case are relatively parallel.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.885" offset="3718875">What happened to the taxpayer in the Hall case was that she was arrested by the Kentucky state police and charged with narcotics -- charged with being involved in the sale of illegal narcotics.</text>

            <text syncTime="1204.342" offset="4920717">There is an argument that the Flora case would bar litigation in the District Court in these types of cases with respect to someone in Mrs. Hall's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.142" offset="4959901">We think that argument misreads this Court in Flora's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.753" offset="4974425">What this Court held in Flora was that under general circumstances a taxpayer cannot bring a refund suit until he has paid the full amount of the assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.597" offset="5029804">In reaching that decision, the Court painstakingly went through the legislative history in connection with the creation of Board of Tax Appeals and there were indications going both ways as to what Congress really intended but I think that the really operative portion of the Chief Justice's opinion in Flora was the fact that there the taxpayer had another remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.998" offset="5139414">He could have gone to the Tax Court and that made all the difference in Flora because essentially you have a situation where if you had subjected to an assessment of $100.00 and you want to pay $2.00 and go to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.787" offset="5206497">Well then this Court said in Flora “You can't do that."</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.461" offset="5221230">"You have to pay the whole $100.00.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.005" offset="5231365">And the reason the Court said that in Flora was because as the Chief Justice said he could have gone to the Tax Court without paying a single cent and the fact of the existence of that Tax Court review convinced the Court that if they had held to the contrary in Flora they would have infringed upon the pre-payment jurisdiction of the Tax Court because essentially you'd have a situation where you could split the course of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.065" offset="5355604">You could in effect litigate the refund suit of $2.00 and perhaps litigate the $98.00 case in the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.425" offset="5381099">This Court held that Congress didn't want to split those courses of action and of course these two different systems that is refund suits and Tax Court review to infringe upon each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.432" offset="5429060">Here that rationale has no application because we say that Congress has made a conscious decision not to give the Tax Court jurisdiction over these termination cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.406" offset="5477021">Once that is accepted as we think the statutory history demonstrates, then Flora is no bar to the bringing of these kinds of suits whether the whole amount is seized or not in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.652" offset="5537938">And that brings me to the point that I wanted to make about the Tax Court not being a particular -- this taxpayers have complained in effect that they have been frozen out of the Tax Court or blocked to immediate access to the Tax Court but given the two-year time that it takes to litigate a tax case in a Tax Court, it seems to us that it would be far more favorable for these taxpayers subject to terminations to bring a refund suit for the amount seized and bringing that suit in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.949" offset="5671163">In most District Courts, the time for bringing a refund suit is considerably shorter than two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.538" offset="5697494">I think that is quite plain with respect to the District Court in Kentucky and certainly it's clear with respect to the District Courts in Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.962" offset="5727169">In fact, that refund suit in Vermont with respect to Laing case is now waiting -- is now being held up awaiting the decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.969" offset="5759248">In effect that this action had never been brought, Laing would have had long ago with disposition with respect to the propriety of his refund claim in the District Court in Vermont.</text>

            <text syncTime="1606.749" offset="6530382">I think that is a significant prejudice to the Commissioner operating under a fair reading of these statutes that he was not so required to issue a notice of efficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.934" offset="6575104">I mean, I suppose the answer also lies in what we are talking about here when we are talking about people who turn up subject to these terminations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1702.560" offset="6913651">And I think that is a fair assumption that people who are involved in clandestine income producing activities which are illegal often do not report the income, do not declare the income from on their income tax return in fact in this particular case Mrs. Hall filed a fully year income tax return reporting a gross income from wages of $530.00 for the whole year.</text>

            <text syncTime="1757.808" offset="7134647">In fact a departing aliens who leave this country every day who are subject to U.S. income tax have their taxably use terminated that is a normal kind of thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1778.657" offset="7218030">But the statute by its term is not limited to alien taxpayers it is also subject to domestic taxpayers as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.196" offset="7260139">For example, in the Irving case that was a celebrated case where Clifford Irving perpetrated a very notable hoax, in which he receive some $765,000.00 from a publishing company in connection whit a false biography.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.947" offset="7331192">Once that hoax was discovered, the Internal Revenue Service, like your case of a burglar, could easily come to the conclusion that Irving was not going to pay taxes on that amount of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.207" offset="7384168">So in the Irving case, Irving's taxable year was terminated and an amount was assess based on that receipt of that money and an amount was levied upon and the Second Circuit rejected Irving's claim which is the same claim of the taxpayers make in these cases that the Commissioner must issue a notice of deficiency with respect to these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.415" offset="7472985">I think that illegal activity raises a connotation that if people are breaking other laws in the clandestine way, I think it is a fair assumption by the internal revenues to assume that they are not going to meet their tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.089" offset="7531708">Indeed the tax -- are tax system is based on a voluntary disclosure and the people are involved in illegal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.053" offset="7563577">It is a fair assumption that they're not going to meet that voluntary obligation and those circumstances Congress has given the Commissioner power to provide, to make this artificial termination of a taxable year because instead of having to wait until the following April 15, Congress has said to the Commissioner you may terminate some ones taxable year and collect taxes on that terminated period.</text>

            <text syncTime="3123.945" offset="12599150">Well I would like to turn to the statutory history in these cases because I think that they shed important ride on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.482" offset="12629347">You see the courts that have held against us in these cases and imposed the filing of the notice of deficiency have in our view impermissibly merged two different statutory provisions that is determination provision and the early assessment provision of Section 6861.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.074" offset="12711685">We don't think that they can be merged, we think that the statutory history in the case that they're separate and distinct provisions which stand by themselves in the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.150" offset="12752018">Indeed, the fact that they came in at different times, we think suggest that are separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.652" offset="12773961">The termination provision is the older provision it came in, in the Revenue Acted of 1918.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.055" offset="12799561">Now from 1918 to 1921 there was no early assessment provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.607" offset="12821817">So Congress had just given the Commissioner power to make terminations of taxable use of people who were engage in tax avoidance activities for that current year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.430" offset="12873122">Now in 1921, Congress decided to established and administrative appeal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.890" offset="12898931">Now that administrator appeal procedure was new and what essentially said was because before the Commissioner would simply make an assessment and then collect the part of the taxpayer didn't pay he had to he was levied upon and then how to suit for refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.231" offset="12960266">But in 1921 the Commissioner decided to set up a procedure whereby the taxpayers claim that is that he didn't know the disputed amount, could be of adhere at least administratively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.711" offset="13006242">So it set up this procedure we abide the Commissioner would have to issue a notice to the taxpayer and the taxpayer then would have 30 days in which the file protest or some statement of his position and then that administrative appeal would be invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.535" offset="13077504">Now Congress also determined that while this administrative appeal was to be invoked, the Commissioner was not permitted to make an assessment or collect the taxes at issue but because of this administrative appeal procedure, Congress realized that there would be cases in which the delay of the administrative appeal would produce a danger to the revenue and that perhaps the taxpayer assets might be wasted or they might be competing creditors or waiting in the wings, so Congress authorized in a proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.928" offset="13219088">And I think that proviso was important we set it out at pages 70 and 71 of our appendix (b) to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.396" offset="13252942">Proviso, which is sort of at the end to first paragraph on page 71 says “Provided that in cases where the Commissioner believes that the collection of the amount due will be jeopardized by such delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.934" offset="13307068">He may make the assessment without giving such notice or awaiting the conclusion of such hearing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.749" offset="13334340">Now this is the statutory predecessor of Section 6861.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.380" offset="13356910">It came into the code only to provide a means for the Commissioner to have means of collection wildly administrative appeal procedure was invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.695" offset="13410200">It has nothing to do with determination provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.895" offset="13422947">Now it's important for the Court to remember that once the Commissioner terminates somebody's taxable year that termination does not -- that statute that is 6851, does not provide the Commission with any assessment authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.721" offset="13494209">That assessment authority derives from the general assessment authority of Section 6201 of the code which is set forth in our appendix (a) of our brief on page 53.</text>

            <text syncTime="3375.341" offset="13604760">Much before 1918, in fact I know that it derives at least from Section 3226 of the revised statutes, which I think you know or that's about 1866 I think, but I think it probably even you know has roots, historical roots before that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.113" offset="13675813">So essentially you have these two provisions in the code standing separately you have the termination provision and you have the early assessment provision which is an exception for the administrative appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.070" offset="13731610">And now in 1924 Congress decided that the administrative appeal was not a sufficient remedy for taxpayers, because essentially it was conducted by Bureau of Internal Revenue employees, so they established an independent form for the review of these cases and it was called the Board of Tax Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.450" offset="13801200">Now the important thing to remember is that the jurisdiction of the Board of Tax Appeals was roughly equivalent to this administrative appeal and again because they would be a delay, possible delay, in the Board of Tax Appeals proceeding and the Commissioner was not permitted in general to assess or collect taxes while a Board of Tax Appeal proceeding was being invoked Congress again provided this kind of proviso that is despite the fact that you have this Board of Tax Appeal proceeding that the Commissioner could assess and collect taxes while the thing was you know even though the taxpayer had invoked the Board of Tax the jurisdiction of the Board of Tax Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.679" offset="13990118">Now that essentially in our view demonstrates two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.238" offset="14008299">Number one it demonstrates the determination provision and the early assessment provision which originated as the proviso are entirely separate provisions and they shouldn't be merged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.316" offset="14056678">Now one of the assumptions on of the really in basic assumptions upon which the decision of the Sixth Circuit here and the decision of Fifth Circuit and Clark against Campbell rest is that the Commissioner as assessment authority in the termination case derives from Section 6861 this early assessment provision and that the Commissioner can -- that in effect, the early assessment provision must be invoked as part of determination process but that as the statutory history demonstrates that is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.514" offset="14205471">The early assessment provision came in simply as an exception to the administrative appeal procedure and that administrative appeal procedure, as Congress laid sort of transform it that into the jurisdiction of the Board of Tax Appeals, was never intended adds the statutes indicate to cover these termination cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.033" offset="14307453">Now I have five minutes left I would prefer to save it for rebuttal unless the Court has any further questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3663.735" offset="14758327">In order for collection to be affected the Commissioner of then has to make and that the administrative act of recording the taxpayers, tax liability on the Service's books account as an assessment and then once having taken that act, which is entitled to tremendous presumption of correctness and operates very much like the civil judgment, then the Commissioner it presents that assessment for the taxpayer and says “Pay this assessment” and if he doesn't pay then the Commissioner must invoke other statutory remedies to effect collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.198" offset="14896149">But 6851 simply authorizes termination and the determination of an amount immediately doing payable, because without that statute the taxes would not be immediately -- would not be due in payable until the following April.</text>

            <text syncTime="3771.330" offset="15188720">I'm Don Heavrin, I'm the attorney for Elizabeth Jane Hall the respondent in the case of the United States versus Elizabeth Jane Hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.068" offset="15219649">I'd like to start out and say this morning that the issue simply stated is what restrictions if any are there on the Internal Revenue Service when the Internal Revenue Service undertakes to collect tax that the service believes is due in owing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.194" offset="15296136">Now under the Code Section 6203 provides that the Regional Director can issue an assessment and the way he issues the assessment is by writing in the ledger in the Regional Directors office the name of the taxpayer and the amount of money that's owed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3819.991" offset="15383385">The interesting aspect of this mechanical procedure is that as soon as the Regional Director makes the entry and writes down your name as Mr. Smith said that‘s very akin to a civil judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.481" offset="15441272">In fact that has the same way because as soon as that entry has made the taxpayer at that moment is in debt to the United States Government for whatever amount the Regional Director puts in the book.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.206" offset="15492159">Now, the Regional Director can make this entry without any particular knowledge about the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.220" offset="15524237">He can make this entry without any evidence whatsoever that the taxpayer used the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.490" offset="15545344">In other words he can choose any person in any amount and put in the book under 6203 and at that moment the taxpayer becomes indebted to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3871.211" offset="15588185">Now, I would submit to this Court that such a situation is dangerous under the best of conditions, but the dangerous greatly magnified when the Government is not making a sincere effort to collect taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3887.829" offset="15654640">In the case at bar, the Government had no interest in Mrs. Hall's tax liability, what the IRS was doing was endeavoring to punish Mrs. Hall non-judicially for an activity that they had concluded that she was involve in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.797" offset="15726529">And they elected to punish Mrs. Hall because of the Presidential Directive which is reproduced in the appendix of our brief where then present in the United States Mr. Nixon suggested that anyone who is expected of being involved in the drug trafficking, the Government used the most vigorous procedures imaginable to enforce the collection of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.719" offset="15818271">Now, the trap as I sit in the brief were set and through fortuity of circumstances, Mrs. Hall stepped into the trap and the Government presented her the $52,000.00 tax bill and they said pay up.</text>

            <text syncTime="3962.703" offset="15954213">Mrs. Hall was not involved in any illegal drug trafficking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.638" offset="15969886">Mrs. Hall was residing quietly at her rental home in Shelby County, Kentucky when the Internal Revenue Service showed up and said “Pay this bill.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.947" offset="16007189">Now she was trapped, the fortuity of circumstances, her husband was arrested, prosecuted and convicted and the state trooper, Powers who is referred to in my brief for some reason which I have never been able to determine, concluded that Mrs. Hall must likewise be involved in her husbands illegal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.343" offset="16084720">So he obtained a search warrant and went out and thoroughly searched Mrs. Hall's premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3999.948" offset="16103215">The search produced two narcotic -- not narcotic substances but two controlled substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4006.603" offset="16129755">One of them was less than one gram of hashish and one was one amphetamine crystal both of these narcotic substances were not the property of Mrs. Hall but were substances that had been used by her husband and Mrs. Hall quite frankly thought that they had all been removed from her home.</text>
            <text syncTime="4026.359" offset="16208854">This, the husbands difficulty had caused some marital problems, I don't want to go outside the record, but I'm trying to explain to Your Honor what led up to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4035.550" offset="16245530">Now when the Government showed up and presented the tax bill to Mrs. Hall, the bill was approximately ten times her entire worth.</text>

            <text syncTime="4053.744" offset="16318360">Now Mr. Smith says that's very simple matter for the taxpayer to go into the United States District Court after he has filed a tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.397" offset="16356916">But the insidious and extremely dangerous thing about this situation is that the tax bill continues so when they deliver the $52,000.00 tax bill to Mrs. Hall they seize her Volkswagen, they take it, they immediately put it up for sale which is exactly what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.735" offset="16434343">Assume for the purposes of this argument the sale of the Volkswagen produce as a thousand dollars, well they take the thousand dollars and they apply it to the $52,000.00 tax bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.386" offset="16476871">Now Mrs. Hall owes $51,000.00 and the collection procedures are still moving.</text>

            <text syncTime="4411.907" offset="17751019">One, in my case I think the facts are so radically different.</text>

            <text syncTime="4418.387" offset="17776933">I can't argue with your logic that if you catch someone at the border who's trying to get out of the country, the Government should have the right to seize the property and hold it until such time as the actual tax liability can be litigated but I'm not entirely sure that that analogy applies to a taxpayer who was not trying to depart the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4447.201" offset="17892185">In other words if the Court holds the way you're thinking Mr. Justice Rehnquist, this could produce some incredible inequities.</text>

            <text syncTime="4625.082" offset="18603656">Decided recently by the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4628.887" offset="18618911">The court in that case addressing this very issue expressly said that the Government did have the right, under the circumstances you've described, to continue to hold the taxpayers property in an amount sufficient to cover the assessed deficiency.</text>

            <text syncTime="4650.041" offset="18703548">The problem though is that if the taxpayer does not have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4654.965" offset="18723192">Now, in all of these other cases that we've discussed in the Sixth and Second Circuit to thought it out over, the taxpayers had the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="4661.800" offset="18750568">For example, in the Irving case at $650,000.00, I believe and Laing, they had $300,000.00, so the Government wasn't asking for an amount that exceeded what the taxpayer had.</text>
            <text syncTime="4672.996" offset="18795395">So they could make that seizure of the $600,000.00 or the $300,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="4677.918" offset="18815039">But in the Hall case, they've asked for $52,000.00, Mrs. Hall by no stretch of the imagination had anything that even approached $52,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="4687.816" offset="18854640">So if the Government was not enjoined and stopped from coming back again and again and again throughout the course of the litigation, they could continue to strip Mrs. Hall of every dime that she made, but in the Clark case and in the Irving case and the Laing case, there wasn't any additional money being taken from the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4709.982" offset="18943352">Am I making myself clear, Mr. Justice Powell?</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.631" offset="18953906">In other words, they took what they found, the $300,000.00 and then they fought it out over who is entitled to the $300,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="4720.516" offset="18985462">In the Hall case, they said its $52,000.00 and they found approximately a thousand dollars in total assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="4727.352" offset="19012733">Now what happens to that other $51,000.00 bill?</text>
            <text syncTime="4731.248" offset="19028407">If they had assessed $50,000.00 and she had $50,000.00 then she could continue her life in a normal way while the Government held on to the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="4740.122" offset="19063829">But when they assessed the $52,000.00 and she didn't have it and they took everything she had, and everything she had did not satisfy the amount of the assessment.</text>

            <text syncTime="5420.581" offset="21785684">I think that codal argument alone that fits the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="5424.196" offset="21800208">For example, in the codal argument, if you read that section 6201, that grants assessment authority for taxes that are to be paid by stamps and the Government continues to ignore that provision in chapter (a) of 6201.</text>
            <text syncTime="5439.406" offset="21861021">Then the last sentence of the first paragraph says this authority for the secretary to asses taxes shall extend to and that enlist four other situations, but none of those situations equal or approach or approximate what we have in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="5455.989" offset="21927372">So it seems that the Government has grasped this one code section and said now this is empowers us to do what we've done in the Instant case and I don't think that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="5466.578" offset="21969690">I think the Government's wrong in the codal argument, Mr. Stewart -- Mr. Smith said that a fair reading of the code illustrates if the Government's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5476.207" offset="22008247">I think that a fair reading of the code indicates the opposite is true, right? I can't get it through my thick head, that's 6201 really gives him the authority to make assessments and jeopardy situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5491.322" offset="22068642">I think I've covered about everything I want to.</text>

            <text syncTime="5495.758" offset="22086405">One interesting aspect which the second circuit suggested that a bond be posted and the Government has -- Mr. Smith argued that the bond aspect was viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5508.936" offset="22139068">Well, as soon that it is viable, 6863 is the code Section that provides for the posting of bonds but Section 6863 does not refer to Section 6851 of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="5523.709" offset="22198209">It refers to 6861 of the code, so the Government is saying under a 6851 situation you can post to bond but really the code provides for the posting of a bond only under a 6861 situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="6482.543" offset="26033507">The Government claims that it can go to 6201 of the code which is the general assessment power and does carry in at the statement by stamp which may mean that it can only collect taxes under that section or assessed by stamp, but nonetheless its general assessment power.</text>
            <text syncTime="6498.346" offset="26096724">They go to that for their assessment authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="6500.931" offset="26107068">They don't in their brief “Section (d)” of that particular statute which in effect directs the Section 6201 (d) specifically states for special rules applicable to deficiencies of income etcetera see Subchapter B.</text>
            <text syncTime="6517.083" offset="26171747">Subchapter B being Section 6211 to 6216.</text>

            <text syncTime="6532.930" offset="26235068">In effect, what we are saying is the Government when you follow its argument to its completion had they included that Section (d) in their brief referring them to Section 6216, you would find that they'd make it complete circle.</text>
            <text syncTime="6545.109" offset="26283760">They start under the jeopardy assessment provisions of Chapter 70 subtitle A.</text>
            <text syncTime="6549.283" offset="26300479">They go to 6201, they get sent to 6216 which sends them back to Chapter 70.</text>
            <text syncTime="6554.588" offset="26321690">I think that its pretty obvious that they have to if they're going to make an assessment under 6251 it has to be done under the authority of 6261 -- 6861, I'm sorry Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6566.544" offset="26369546">Now why don't they want will assess under 6861 which is the net following statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="6677.950" offset="26815195">You see Your Honor, the difference in this particular case, this type of situation is that this is a totally capricious and arbitrary act by the Commissioner, and it's done generally in cases involving a means of punishing people who are suspected of drug dealings or gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="6694.910" offset="26883009">It's not a bona fide attempt to collect a tax because if in fact it was, and I can't speak for my brother, Mrs. Hall is a very inoffensive young little lady sitting there in a rented house with little Volkswagen.</text>
            <text syncTime="6706.938" offset="26931075">She's not hurting anybody, they don't have to destroy her at the collective tax and I think that this is when you see in fact that it's really a means of law enforcement of punishment not a means of obtaining revenue for the Government you then see then the necessity for putting an impartial magistrate between the Government and the citizenry of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="6798.883" offset="27298879">Just a few points Mr. Chief Justice, I think that the record in both these cases cannot support any inference that the Commissioner's efforts in this regard are anything but tax collection efforts. There is no suggestion on these records that these cases involve any harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6817.894" offset="27374947">Indeed the Court last term involved Jones University and Americans United said simply that you cannot impute that kind of motivation other than tax collecting efforts to the Commissioner without a solid factual foundation.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="6848.228" offset="27496260">Yes, I want to make that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="6850.819" offset="27506604">What happen in the whole case was she filed the tax return reporting $530.00 of gross income for the full taxable year and claiming a refund of some $76.00 on taxes withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="6864.115" offset="27559790">Now the Commissioner was subject to an injunction by the District Court which was affirmed in the Sixth Circuit in Hall which said that he was not permitted to make any tax collection steps against her for the assessment for the terminated period.</text>
            <text syncTime="6881.610" offset="27629798">It was determined that unless the refund was paid because no stay was sought that the Commissioner might well be in contempt of the District Court's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="6893.235" offset="27676296">So that amount was paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="6894.851" offset="27682774">That payment in no way can notes that the Commissioners satisfied that Mrs. Hall has fully complied with the tax law liability for the year 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="6904.976" offset="27723316">To the contrary, it was simply made in order to avoid any suggestion that the Internal Revenue Service might be violating a court order by applying the $76.00 claim to the amount to the assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6916.737" offset="27770337">I think I want to make something else clear because there's been some confusion on the point of the effect of the filling of a notice of deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="6923.550" offset="27797608">The effect of a filling of a notice of deficiency in a jeopardy situation does not restrain and the invocation of Tax Court jurisdiction does not restrain the Commissioner of Internal Revenue from continuing to collect taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6938.287" offset="27856541">If you look at Section 6213 (a) which is set forth at page 56 of appendix A of our brief, you see that there is an exception down at the last three lines, exceptions otherwise provided in Section 6861 no assessment or deficiency so forth and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6953.324" offset="27916622">So the jeopardy situation is an exception to the normal rule that attacks court preceding states collection.</text>
