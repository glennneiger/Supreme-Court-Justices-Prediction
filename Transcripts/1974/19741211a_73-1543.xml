            <label>Ms. Deborah M. Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="74.579" offset="401638">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.333" offset="412714">This case comes here on a writ of certiorari to the United State's Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.766" offset="438418">The writ was directed to the question of whether the timely filing of a charge of employment discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission tolls the running of the statute of limitations applicable to an action based on the same facts brought under Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.266" offset="524413">Petitioner Willy Johnson Junior, a Black man was hired by REA Express in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.085" offset="559731">In 1967, he filed with the EEOC a charge of racial discrimination against REA and two locals of the brotherhood of railway clerks.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.508" offset="609364">He charged REA with discriminatory job assignments and the locals with being racially segregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.021" offset="643427">Three weeks later, REA fired petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.143" offset="655966">Petitioner then amended his EEOC charge to include discriminatory discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.168" offset="679999">Respondents were given notice of the charges in September 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.892" offset="702986">An EEOC charge -- investigation substantiated petitioner's charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.223" offset="724302">And in March 1970, the EEOC issued a determination finding reasonable cause to believe that respondents had violated the Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.701" offset="766203">After efforts at conciliation failed on January 4th 1971, petitioner received from the EEOC his notice of right to sue on January 15, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.616" offset="833808">When he was unable to obtain private counsel, the District Court-appointed counsel to represent him and permitted him to file his right to sue a letter as a complaint on a pauperis oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.549" offset="881560">On March 18, 1971, the court-appointed attorney filed a supplemental complaint alleging violation of both Title VII and Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.237" offset="928371">Respondents filed motions to dismiss or for summary judgment with supporting affidavits and memoranda of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.095" offset="959718">Petitioner's court-appointed attorney filed no papers in opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.975" offset="979257">The court dismissed all claims under Section 1981 as barred by the Tennessee one year statute of limitations on actions for compensatory or punitive damages brought under Federal Civil Right statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.991" offset="1039339">On a record which contained undisputed evidence of the maintenance of segregated locals and higher membership dues for Blacks, the court granted summary judgment to the “unions on the grounds that plaintiffs had, “No grounds for relief under Title VII” and granted partial summary judgment to REA on the issue of the lack of supervisory training.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.709" offset="1142157">The issues that remained in the case were claims under Title VII against REA for discriminatory job assignment referral to segregated locals, discriminatory application of seniority rules -- discriminatory discharge and discriminatory disciplinary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.449" offset="1221151">The case was set for trial and REA took discovery and filed a pretrial memorandum as required by the local rules of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.959" offset="1251244">Petitioner's court-appointed attorney did nothing. REA then offered petitioner a settlement of $150.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.214" offset="1280188">And when petitioner refused this offer, his court-appointed counsel filed a motion to withdraw.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.499" offset="1313416">The court clerk advised the petitioner by letter, that the motion of which petitioner had received no notice had been granted and that if petitioner did not obtain another lawyer within 30 days, his case would be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.045" offset="1371512">Petitioner went to the local legal aid society, to the bar association referral service and to two private attorneys to whom he was referred by the EEOC, all to no avail.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.160" offset="1416025">Finally, he went to a Memphis law firm and explained his plight to William Caldwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.628" offset="1437863">I should explain at this point that when petitioner first received his right to sue a letter, he went to the same firm and they were unable to take his case because of the great number of Title VII cases to which the court had appointed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.514" offset="1497422">Caldwell wrote to the Chief Judge of the District Court stating that he was attempting to obtain support for the suit and requesting an additional 30 days to obtain counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.457" offset="1537233">But just the day before, on February 16, 1972, an order had been entered dismissing petitioner's case without prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.227" offset="1576312">On May 5th, Caldwell again wrote the District -- the Chief Judge indicating that the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund had agreed to pay the cost of litigation entering an appearance and requesting that the order of dismissal be vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.695" offset="1650186">The Chief Judge wrote back suggesting that it would be appropriate for Caldwell to file a new action.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.451" offset="1673174">On May 31, Caldwell filed a new complaint under both Title VII and Section 1981 reiterating petitioner's original allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.048" offset="1715597">The District Court dismissed the complaint on several grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.778" offset="1730435">First, with respect to petitioner's Title VII claims, he held that the interlocutory order of June 14, 1971 in the first action granting summary judgment to respondent locals and partial summary judgment to REA was a final judgment constituting res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.191" offset="1820087">Second, that petitioner's claims under Section 1981 were barred by Tennessee's one year statute of limitations and also barred because of petitioner's failure exhaust remedies under the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.617" offset="1877870">Third, he held that petitioner's Title VII action against REA was barred by his failure to re-file within 30 days after the dismissal without prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.244" offset="1924368">The Court of Appeals affirmed disposing of the case on timeliness grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.042" offset="1943489">It held that the Title VII action was barred because the second action was filed more than 30 days after the dismissal of the first action and held that the statute of limitations on petitioner's Section 1981 action was not told by the filing of his EEOC charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.083" offset="2019662">Rehearing was denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="491.559" offset="2069608">I take the position that isn't the real, genuine meaning for remedy?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="deborah_m_greenberg" startTime="498.276" stopTime="795.551">
            <label>Ms. Deborah M. Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="498.276" offset="2096462">We would take the position that there are independent remedies under Section 1981 and Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.253" offset="2120391">We -- in our petition for certiorari asked the court to review the holding that the plaintiffs -- petitioners should have exhausted his remedies under the Railway Labor Act and the court did not agree to review that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.857" offset="2186846">Petitioner and the United States as amicus curiae urged the court to adopt the rule of the Fifth and DC circuits namely, that the filing of an EEOC charge operates to toll the running of the statute of limitations on an action based on the same facts brought under Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.382" offset="2268871">If such a rule is applied to the case at bar, petitioner's Section 1981 action was timely filed under Tennessee's one year statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.102" offset="2311816">He filed his charge with the EEOC on May 31, 1967 while still employed by REA.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.569" offset="2345671">The discriminatory acts alleged there in were continuing in nature so that none of the one year period had run prior to said filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.509" offset="2385377">He received his notice of right to sue on January 15, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.480" offset="2421321">The supplemental complaint in the first action and that was the first pleading to state a cause of action under Section 1981 was filed 62 days later on March 18, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.958" offset="2479208">So, to that point only 62 days had run if the tolling rules were adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.650" offset="2501987">The statute stopped running when the action was filed and did not start running again until February 16, 1972 when the action was dismissed without prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.941" offset="2555173">The second action was filed 105 days after the dismissal of the first action on May 31, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.930" offset="2587042">Thus, a total of 167 days of the Tennessee one year statute had run.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.758" offset="2618389">The purposes underlying the statute of limitations, notice to the defendants and the barring of stale claims by plaintiff who has slept on his rights, were served by the filing of petitioner's EEOC charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.840" offset="2678784">In Burnett versus New York Central, this Court suggested that the basic inquiry is whether congregational purpose would be effectuated by tolling the statute of limitations in the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.637" offset="2741896">As this Court recognize in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver, it is clear from the legislative history of Title VII that Congress intended that individual be able to pursue his rights to be free from racial discrimination and employment under both Title VII and Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.813" offset="2818591">It is equally clear that Congress prefer the process of fact finding and conciliation provided in Title VII and hope that litigation would be resorted to only if this process was not effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.926" offset="2871045">Both policies can be accommodated by adopting the tolling rule urged by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.723" offset="2894242">Bringing suit under Section 1981 is of course simpler than bringing suit under Title VII as there are no administrative remedies that must be exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.419" offset="2937083">Indeed, one of the grounds urged by the sponsors of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 for rejecting an amendment that would have made Title VII the exclusive remedy was that procedural requirements of Title VII may sometimes prevent and aggrieve individual from obtaining redress.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.372" offset="3012838">And in such event, he should be able to fall back on Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.877" offset="3038856">On the other hand, from the point of view of the individual with limited resources unable to obtain counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.088" offset="3063724">Title VII is the better remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.301" offset="3072606">The EEOC can investigate and conciliate claims and can even bring suit on behalf of complainant.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.351" offset="3100818">As long as a person has reason to hope that he can get the relief he seeks by resort to the EEOC he should not have to go to the expense of filing suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.784" offset="3146480">As Judge Tuttle, writing for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting en banc in Kessler versus EEOC said, “Competent lawyers are not eager to enter the fray in behalf of a person who is seeking redress until Title VII.”</text>
            <text syncTime="776.654" offset="3210010">This is true even though provision is made for payment of attorney's fees in the event of success.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.981" offset="3235297">Therefore, he held the resources of the EEOC such as their investigatory files should be made available to the private litigant to make it less difficult for him to bring this case to court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1075.009" offset="4403388">Affirmance of the decision below would not only do violence to congressional policy with respect to preserving a petitioner's right of action under 1981 and its policy of the same time of encouraging resort to the conciliatory processes of the EEOC but would also -- could also have adverse effects on the federal judicial system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.002" offset="4507355">The aggrieved employee would have to file his EEOC charge, file suit under 1981 if he could obtain counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.059" offset="4531597">And very likely see his action come to judgment on his 1981 action before the EEOC have had the chance to investigate his charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.774" offset="4566497">If he did not file suit, he would run the risk of foregoing his rights under Section 1981 and running a file of the procedural requirements of Title VII as the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.905" offset="4614980">One can only speculate about the number of such precautionary suits that might be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.145" offset="4635982">However, the EEOC informs us that in fiscal 1974, it received over 50,000 new charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.715" offset="4670255">Of the charges investigated and which decisions were issued, 44% were found to be without probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.106" offset="4703796">As this Court observed in Alexander versus Gardner-Denver with respect to the conciliatory or therapeutic processes of arbitration, the processes of the EEOC may satisfy an employee's perceived need to resort to the judicial forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.587" offset="4773700">This Court's recent holding in American Pipe versus Utah, that the avoidance of precautionary litigation is a sound reason for tolling a statute of limitations is equally applicable to the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.299" offset="4832528">Respondents contend in their briefs that the principles of Burnett and American Pipe do not apply to this case because they involved the tolling of federal, not state statutes of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.300" offset="4884564">This contention was squarely rejected in Holmberg versus Armbrecht where Mr. Justice Frankfurter stated, it would be too incongruous to confine a federal right within the bare terms of a state's statute of limitations unrelieved by the settled federal equitable doctrine as to fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="1239.076" offset="5059688">My opponent is in error in stating that the commission had concluded that conciliation had failed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.020" offset="5091453">In actual fact as page 75A of the record shows, the right to sue a letter was issued in response to a request from the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.797" offset="5150595">The case involved 10 employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.870" offset="5162820">So far as I am informed the commission has never concluded conciliation efforts and it did not advise the petitioner that its efforts had failed which brings into play Section 29, CFR Section 160125 (b) of the commission's regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.607" offset="5265847">That provision states that when a right to sue letter has been issued at the request of a complainant then the commissions proceedings shall suspend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.472" offset="5329272">That is the word of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.441" offset="5345155">Now, the consequence of that I submit is that the commission's proceedings are still in a state off suspense and if this Court is to hold the commission proceedings, toll the running of a statute of limitations under the 1866 Act that state of suspense could go on for an indefinite period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.901" offset="5451003">Something that was entirely not contemplated by Congress when it passed the 1964 Act and specified that judicial action in these cases must begin properly.</text>

            <text syncTime="1461.817" offset="5950673">But the court could decide it on that narrow ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.560" offset="5969586">They were not going to hold here, that it can extend beyond the period allowed in the 1964 Act and reserve for another day the question posed by Guerra against Manchester Terminal in the Fifth Circuit which I understand they are going to petition for certiorari on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.647" offset="6045968">They can either decide -- the court can either decide on the narrow ground or it can decide on the broader ground which we have brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.658" offset="6078046">And that is that under the 1866 Act which does have in it Section 1988, Congress has said specifically that you must refer to state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.127" offset="6139904">Now, there's no dispute in this case that for the purpose of referring the state law, you do refer to the state statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.488" offset="6181282">The only question in this case is if under Section 1988 you must refer to state law for limitations periods, whether you must also refer to state law for the purpose of tolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.992" offset="6251290">And we submit Your Honor that it does not make sense to refer to state law for one limited purpose when tolling and statute of limitations are all part impartial of the same statutory framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.812" offset="6326627">So that the cases that do not deal with the effect of Section 1988 sidestep the issue and the case that it does deal with that case, the best recent case I submit is the case in the Third Circuit, Ammlung against City of Chester which was decided under Section 1983 and other Section of the 1866 Act.And in the Ammlung case, the Third Circuit focused specifically on the effect of 1988 and it said, “If you're going to refer to the state law for the purpose of the statute of limitations, you must also refer to the state law for the purpose of the tolling provision.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.647" offset="6533935">That is the holding in Ammlung.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.473" offset="6545220">They -- Ammlung holding also speaks of the disarray that is found in the Fifth Circuit cases on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.871" offset="6574895">The Fifth Circuit cases go both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.178" offset="6584090">You can cite two cases in the Fifth Circuit in our favor and you could cite two cases from the Fifth Circuit in the favor of petitioner and those are not dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.632" offset="6629857">As far as the District of Columbia Circuit case is concerned, that is dictum because the court found that the alleged discrimination in that case was a -- of a continuing nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.525" offset="6689520">Now, I would like to speak about a case that the petitioner relies on principally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.739" offset="6718360">And that's the Moviecolor case in the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.128" offset="6735914">The Moviecolor case was an antitrust case and in extensive dictum not necessary for the disposition of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.906" offset="6787009">Judge Friendly has analyzed what is this doctrine of federal tolling?</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.068" offset="6823685">The decision of Judge Friendly makes it clear that going all the way back to the case of Bailey against Glover decided by this Court in 1874 in 21 Wallace, the concept of federal tolling applies: one, where there is a federal statute of limitation, and remember we are talking here about an admitted application of a state statute not a federal statute of limitation or alternatively where there is fraud or concealment involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.294" offset="7000586">Indeed, that portion of the Moviecolor case that is quoted on page three of the reply brief for petitioner makes it quite clear that Judge Friendly's decision there is premised upon the concept of concealment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.433" offset="7101106">And concealment is not an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.590" offset="7121690">More importantly then what the quotation set forth on page three shows we submit is the language that's contained in what was deleted from that quotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.127" offset="7187832">On page three of the reply brief, it appears that the quotation provided by the petitioner is the beginning of a paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.353" offset="7248750">But in fact the sentence that begins that paragraph reads as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.902" offset="7286993">In the last analysis, decision of that issue namely tolling requires an attempt to divine a purpose of Congress on a subject where no purpose has been manifested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.269" offset="7360449">If indeed, it was had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.842" offset="7382706">Now, we submit that that language is dispositive of this case because Congress has manifested a purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.554" offset="7429622">It has enacted Section 1988 of the 1866 Act in which for purposes of these cases reference is made to state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.261" offset="7496391">That's entirely apart from the concept of borrowing from state statutes as a matter of comity this is a congressional directive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.110" offset="7535783">When Congress passed the 1964 Act, it did not focus upon this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.940" offset="7571101">As this Court's decision in Jones against Mayer Company shows, that Congress did not seem to be aware of the 1866 Act when it enacted the 1964 Act in this Court's opinion and the Jones case does say that therefore it cannot be expected that the 1964 Act had any effect upon preexisting rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.470" offset="7677262">That's the holding of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.033" offset="7687502">Subsequently, Congress did focus on the existence of the 1866 Act partly as a result of this Court's decision against Jones against Mayer in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.662" offset="7758033">And in the legislative history of the amendments to the 1972 Act, it's made clear that Congress did not intend to affect existing rights under prior legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.362" offset="7824802">That is what the legislative history shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.895" offset="7842983">So that we have a situation in which as Moviecolor points out, the purpose is to inquire into what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.142" offset="7895960">And here you have three evidences of congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.811" offset="7914663">First, you have what they said in 1988 of the 1866 Act which is you refer as state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.572" offset="7949667">Secondly, we have the 1964 Act in the subsequent decision of this Court in Jones in which it is held that Congress did not intend to effect rights under preexisting legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.455" offset="8013197">The third evidence of congressional intent is what Congress itself provided in the Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.491" offset="8061367">And that is that lawsuits must be brought at an earlier time then is possible or is contended for by the petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.667" offset="8110059">The effect of the tolling which they seek in this case would be to extend the time for lawsuits beyond that which Congress itself provided in its most recent enactment on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.600" offset="8173798">And in view of those three indications of congressional intent and in view of the fact that the analysis of Judge Friendly in Moviecolor shows that application of tolling to the facts of this case which do not involve fraud or concealment would be pushing the doctrine farther that it has ever been pushed before.</text>

            <text syncTime="2221.115" offset="8987878">Now, there was a question also on the Railway Labor Act procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.471" offset="9005223">The decision below was that prior resort was required under the Railway Labor Act procedures and that would be dispositive of this case even if the court should rule in petitioner's favor because there was a question raised but certiorari was not granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.069" offset="9107623">Furthermore, the record indicates that this is precisely the kind of case in which the common law of the shop should be applied and could have been applied with respect to the petitioner because it involved the application of a system, of the merits, a number of particular charges and he could have been represented in that system without cause to himself unless he pursued that system of industrial justice that is provided in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.478" offset="9273240">I don't know how he could establish that he had been damaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.173" offset="9300093">The reference was made to the fact that his prior counsel had recommended settlement which the petitioner did not agree with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.069" offset="9343666">I think that if one raised the deposition of petitioner in this case, one can see why his prior counsel recommended settlement, because petitioner admitted in his deposition that because of the massive layoffs in REA employees with 25 years seniority were those who could retain jobs and he only had seven years seniority in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.865" offset="9458813">He admitted that he would have been laid off under normal application of the company's reduction enforce system two years before his deposition was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.610" offset="9509804">So, one can well understand why his first counsel recommended settlement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2364.727" offset="9562258">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.905" offset="9578977">The two union local largest of the Brotherhood of Railway &amp; Airline Clerks which I represent find themselves in an unusual posture in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.517" offset="9621400">At the time the second complaint was filed in May 1972 which was the complaint before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.544" offset="9653582">These two lodges had not been in the case for few days short of a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.251" offset="9676361">They had been eliminated from the case a year before by an order of the District Court which had not been appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.529" offset="9705514">Dismissing the 1981 action on the basis, the Tennessee state -- statute of limitations and finding that on the undisputed facts there was no claim, valid claim by the plaintiff against the two union largest and running summary judgments with respect to the Title VII claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.289" offset="9780537">Consequently, when the second complaint was filed, these two union largest have made a move for dismissal or summary judgment on the basis of res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.672" offset="9818049">The District Court on -- with another judge sitting granted that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.729" offset="9838320">We got to the Court of Appeals that was appealed by the petitioner with that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.124" offset="9859845">The Court of Appeals focused on the jurisdictional problem in its original opinion and its opinion on rehearing, the petition on rehearing after referring to the jurisdictional problem that specifically stated that the two local unions had a completely -- complete defense against all claims of the petitioner based on res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.263" offset="9956394">The petitioner sought cert in this Court on that issue and this Court denied cert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.445" offset="9981158">Now, the petitioner and their brief, original brief and in their reply brief filed a few days ago says this Court should remand the res judicata issue to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.866" offset="10034866">And the amicus brief states that these two local unions are asking this Court to affirm the judgment below in this alternative ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.937" offset="10071124">Neither one of this are correct in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.693" offset="10082095">Our position is that that the case when this Court denied certiorari on the issue that ended it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.366" offset="10116786">It is a final and binding judgment now as to these two respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.855" offset="10138833">It's the law of the case and moral of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.014" offset="10159417">Now, I would like to address myself briefly to the tolling issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.589" offset="10173733">I'm not going back over the ground that Mr. Wisehart went into.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.384" offset="10196929">But I would like to say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.139" offset="10211976">The petitioner's case boils down simply to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.272" offset="10228485">They say that in terms of congressional intent and public policy, they must have the tolling principle applied here because of the public policy expressed by Congress in the conciliation process under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.241" offset="10300374">And petitioner's counsel as I understood it made reference to a plaintiff who had money needed to and who could go ahead with 1981, still needed to file a petition and one who didn't have money needed to wait for conciliation with the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.658" offset="10386056">Well, of course the one who has the money and wants to go on ahead under 1981 can because all he has to do is wait 180 days and get a right to sue a letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.927" offset="10419075">This petitioner got a right to sue letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.722" offset="10430255">He got it about four years later which is the other side of the coin, which is that -- as the amicus brief says, you have to have tolling here to let conciliation work because they say that the EEOC because of its caseload, the lack of money and its budget and lack of staff simply cannot get around the conciliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.504" offset="10521370">All it means and it meant in this case that you as a matter never have any conciliation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.868" offset="10546866">That's the real other side of the coin.So when you finally get around to litigating one of these matters, they have reached the point of being in violation of the principles on which statutes of limitations are based of litigating stale claims which is unfair to the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.517" offset="10629413">Now in there briefs the petitioner says, “No, that's not so here because they say the defendants will have notice from the EEOC that there is a discrimination problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.294" offset="10668596">So you can't get stale on them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.856" offset="10678836">Well, the notice that you have after the 1972 Amendment is one little sheet paper with a few boxes on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.723" offset="10710288">Above all it tells you as there is some discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.129" offset="10723871">Apart of that time you did get a notice with the copy of the complaint but even that didn't give you too much notice because the Sanchez case, and other cases has been cited by petitioner's counsel were so broad in permitting on Title VII complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.743" offset="10790327">They had charges different than those before the commission that you didn't really get any notice then either.</text>
