            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We will hear arguments next in United States against Jenkins, 73-1513.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="37.181" offset="252113">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.366" offset="264861">This case is here on a grant of the petition of the United States for a writ of certiorari to a review decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the second circuit, which dismiss the Government's appeal from an order of the District Court in this case which in turn the dismiss respondent Jenkins indictment for knowing failure to submit to induction into the arm services.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.554" offset="357543">This case is related to the next case which you will hear, United States against Wilson.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.354" offset="376769">Both involved the issue of whether the United States may appeal constitutionally consistently with the Double Jeopardy clause from a post trial ruling which would be denominated on acquittal under the definition in Jenkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.427" offset="453047">The Wilson case also involves the further issue of whether the ruling there was an acquittal for purposes of such a rule if the court were to adopt such a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.733" offset="494320">Now the pertinent facts surrounding Jenkins offense as disclosed by the evidence at trial and has specifically found by the District Court are undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.821" offset="542699">Mr. Jenkins was ordered on February 4th, 1971 to report for induction on February 24th.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.258" offset="572374">The validity of that order as initially issued is on challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.190" offset="588152">Mr. Jenkins received that order, he wrote the local board thereafter requesting a form on which to apply for contentious subject to classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.486" offset="629321">On the day before his induction, he went down to this local board, again to pick up this form.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.082" offset="655653">At that time, he gave them a brief written statement of his contentious subjection claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.991" offset="679372">At that time, eh was told that his induction order would not be postpones and that he should report the following day.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.661" offset="706017">On February 24th, 1971, he failed to report for induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.509" offset="729422">These findings were all specifically made by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.888" offset="750947">Now it is the Government's position that these facts required as a matter of law, the entry of a judgment of conviction against respondent Jenkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.698" offset="786160">However, the District Court concluded that because these offense took place prior to this Court's decision in Ehlert and because that the time of these events in the view of the District Court, it was the law of the Second Circuit that the local board was required to postpone respondent Jenkins induction and to consider his claim of like crystallizing conscientious objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.407" offset="876962">It would be unfair to apply the Ehlert principle to the defendant who was before the District Court.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="253.437" stopTime="255.951">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="253.437" offset="1117080">It does not need to be on the record.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="255.951" stopTime="401.798">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="255.951" offset="1127215">Well I do not know whether this Court could take judicial notice of it, but I think that what the District Court held was that with respect to people, who at that time were ordered to report for induction when the law of the Second Circuit has been held in the Gearey case, it would be unfair to apply Ehlert retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.111" offset="1207777">Now that is a question of law and that is a question of law which was decided in favor of the Government in the case called Mercado, which was then pending on appeal in the second circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.201" offset="1252185">Because of the conflict between the two cases, the Solicitor General authorized an appeal in the Jenkins case.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.894" offset="1274964">And as the Court of Appeals decision in Mercado, clearly establishes, the District Court here was in error in dismissing the indictment and the respondent was demonstrably guilty and he should properly have been convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.195" offset="1328149">However, divided panel of the Court of Appeals never reached the merits of our appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.055" offset="1347584">Rather, it held that the District Court's action although label the dismissal was in fact an acquittal as the concept was defined in the United against Sisson.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.074" offset="1391679">While the Court of Appeals recognize that the amended criminal appeals act would authorize the Government's appeal if the constitution permits it.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.048" offset="1419577">It concluded that this Court's decisions in Ball, Kepner, Fong Foo and Sisson prevented it.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.395" offset="1444968">The Court of Appeals as an inferior court from allowing the appeal in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.200" offset="1464195">Although there is some suggestion that Judge Friendly felt that these holdings were suitable for reconsideration by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.307" offset="1508603">Now the issue in this case may be simply stated, dopes the Double Jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment bar Government appeal from a post trial decision of the District Court terminating a prosecution in favor of the defendant with such a decision is an acquittal under the definition of the concept in Sisson if the appeal raises only issues of law and if a reversal would not require the defendant to undergo a second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.053" offset="1619571">Now the constitutional question of the appealability of a legal erroneous acquittal where no second trial was required is surprisingly enough in view of its importance, a matter of first impression before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.241" offset="1680384">Later in my argument show in detail why this is so, with reference to the four cases relied upon by Judge Friendly.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="401.798" stopTime="404.588">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="401.798" offset="1710582">Is Fong Foo pretty much in point?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="404.588" stopTime="412.856">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="404.588" offset="1721762">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.423" offset="1725106">I will get to it later, but briefly Fong Foo was not in point because what it prohibited was an appeal where a retrial would be required.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="412.856" stopTime="416.934">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="412.856" offset="1754781">But that was legally erroneous acquittal, was it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="416.934" stopTime="543.252">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="416.934" offset="1771081">That is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.554" offset="1773589">I mean Fong Foo establishes the preposition that there maybe circumstances in which a legally erroneous acquittal is not reviewable, but it was not talking about the circumstances of this case because in Fong Foo, the trial had never been completed and you really were in a Summerville Perez type of interrupted trial situation ending in acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.234" offset="1872332">That is perhaps close in some ways adjourn.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.591" offset="1889782">The reason why this is a question of basically first impression today in 1974 is clear when you look at the history that common law and under the holding of this Court in the Sanges case, the Government had no right of appeal in criminal cases in the absence of a statute authorizing such appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.751" offset="1970343">And then in 1907, Congress pass the old criminal appeals act and it was construed in such a manner ultimately in Sisson, but it had been all along to preclude appeals in cases of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.371" offset="2028857">So as a matter of statutory law prior to 1971, the federal Government could not appeal rulings of this sort in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.983" offset="2059264">Moreover, the issue did not come up in state cases because the Double Jeopardy clause under the ruling in Palko was not being applicable to the states until a fairly recent decision of this Court amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.433" offset="2113076">And I would like here to just point out with respect to the significance of betting something that Judge Friendly noted, which is that the ruling that you make in this case today is a ruling that will be binding not only the federal Government but on each of the 50 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.221" offset="2172217">And if you say there can be no appeal here, you are saying that this is a fundamental principle that is applicable equal force allover.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.035" offset="2203564">And I should note that there are some states that have authorized appeals in this situation as a matter of state law, as a recent decision of the New York, Court of Appeals in July of this year a case called People against Isabella, 359 New York sub 2nd 100.</text>

            <text syncTime="568.617" offset="2377853">Our position in this case is a very simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.189" offset="2392168">We say that the concept of Double Jeopardy relates to the subjection of the defendant [inaudible] criminal case to a second trial that therefore comes into play only where second trail is to be had since our appeal if successful would not lead to a second trial, Double Jeopardy is simply irrelevant here and the appeal is constitutionally permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.668" offset="2478059">Now in our brief, we have set forth various authorities that make it clear that the element of second trial was at the heart of the Double Jeopardy notion at common law and in the application of the American contintitutional principle as explicated by this Court on numerous occasions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1441.393" offset="5868962">First of all, it did not say any further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.124" offset="5879829">It said that you cannot have an appeal because what the Government is asking for, you cannot have mandamus, you cannot have appellant review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.034" offset="5907519">So what the Government is asking for is to start the whole proceeding over again and panel of new jury begin all over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.319" offset="5932596">That is not our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.652" offset="5938030">It is not remotely like our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.673" offset="5946075">There simply is no question of having a second trial in this case in a sense which double – it is relevant to Double Jeopardy under the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.079" offset="5983692">And the second point about Fong Foo is that the issue of whether an acquittal could be appeal was never argued and Fong Foo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.690" offset="6014098">The Government simply rested its contention in that case on the contention of what happened that was not an acquittal and not at all on the question of whether which is here today about the appealability of acquittals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.670" offset="6058088">That was assumed is given by all parties and they are only in the context where reversal would lead to a second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.482" offset="6093302">Now before getting to the cases in detail, I would like to consider the ramifications of policy for this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.949" offset="6135202">The effect of the ruling below as well as that of the Court of Appeals in Wilson is to let a clearly guilty defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.253" offset="6164355">That is one that has been found by the beyond a reasonable doubt to have committed all the acts constituting the offense, to let such a defendant go free because of a trial judges erroneous interpretation of a point of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.881" offset="6222869">Now we submit that one is hard pressed to imagine how such a result furthers the ends of public justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.393" offset="6248991">As Mr. Justice Harlan said in dealing with a related question in United States against Tateo which is in 377 U.S. at page 466 corresponding to the right of an accused to be given a fair trail is the societal interest one whose guilt is clear after he has obtained such a trial to what Mr. Jenkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.597" offset="6337808">It would be a high price indeed for society to pay where every accused granted immunity from punishment because of any defects efficient to constitute reversible error in the proceedings leading to conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.581" offset="6381693">Now there, he was talking about a retrial after a conviction, but I think the thoughts a policy matter in terms of what we are talking about here, what kind of protection we are affording to defendants if we adopt the role of the second circuit in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.385" offset="6432893">I think the thoughts are pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.344" offset="6440730">He also made another point in this connection, in tat paragraph into tail in which he said that if the rule or otherwise appellant courts would be lower to apply the laws as they saw fit in reverse convictions because the consequence would be to immunize the defendant from a retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.079" offset="6515649">Well, the same thing is true here if you say that an error of law by the District Court committed on a motion such as this forever immunizes the defendant from further proceedings no matter how erroneous the ruling is, then district judges are going to be reluctant to make these rulings the way they see fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.761" offset="6590464">They will leave it to the Court of Appeals in order to avoid these manifestly on just situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.244" offset="6612302">So it is not an unmitigated blessing for the defendant if you were to adopt the position of the second circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.063" offset="6639574">I would like to reserve the balance of time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1647.561" offset="6693595">Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.958" offset="6711254">The issue that the court will have to determine after the submission of the briefs and the oral argument in this case, is whether the United States had the right to appeal from the District Court's order acquitting the defendant in this case after trial and after the defendant had been put into jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.543" offset="6809579">Whether the Court of Appeals in this case was correct in its determination that it did not have jurisdiction under either section 3731 of title 18 or under the Double Jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to hear and determine this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.035" offset="6895470">The Government contends that the District Court's decision was appealable because it was purely legal ruling with undisputed findings of fact and that this is purely legal ruling could be corrected by the mere expedient of sending the case back to the District Court with instructions to enter a judgment of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.723" offset="7014275">Aside from the fact that I feel that such a cause goes directly counted to the spirit that the Double Jeopardy clause is suppose to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.711" offset="7070177">I do not think that this particular position by the Government has any sanction or any support in the cases of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.572" offset="7133706">As our contention that the decision of the District Court judge was one that was based on facts do set the trial which went to the general issue of the case and as such this was an acquittal from which no appeal was to be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.858" offset="7226807">In addition, we question whether the decision of the District Court was a purely legal ruling and whether this so called legal ruling could be corrected by the simple expedient of directing a judgment of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.825" offset="7306637">We further question whether the Government has complied with section 3731 of the criminal appeals act in that this appeal was not expeditiously prosecuted as is mandated by section 3731.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.022" offset="7387512">To delve in to the facts of this case, On February 4th, 1971, Mr. Jenkins received a notice to report for induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.585" offset="7433697">Directly thereafter and this notice to report of induction – excuse me, it was February 24th of 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.894" offset="7471000">Directly thereafter, Mr. Jenkins went to a draft counselor by the name Jerome Bobbled, in turn, Mr. Bobbled contacted myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.507" offset="7525439">Subsequently, Mr. Jenkins mailed a letter to the local board requesting a CO150 form, and to this, he received no response from the local board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.766" offset="7586461">On February 23rd of 1974, the date before Mr. Jenkins was to report for induction, Mr. Jenkins went to the local board, he had conversation with Mrs. Elaine Morris, the secretary of the local board and he asked that he be given a CO150 form and that his induction date be postponed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.777" offset="7714461">At that time, Mrs. Morris called New York City Headquarters and spoke to Mr. Thomas Mahan, who was the chief of the legal division of selected service headquarters in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.032" offset="7771512">Mr. Mahan directed that Mr. Jenkins write out a brief statement of his beliefs in opposition to war.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.414" offset="7809024">After doing so and after reading this brief statement to Mr. Mahan over the telephone, Mr. Mahan determined that Mr. Jenkins had not made out a prima facie case for opposition to owe a war because Mr. Jenkins in a statement had said that he was opposed to the war, this present war although he did not exclude opposition to owe a war in his statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1955.739" offset="7926366">Mr. Mahan was the director of a legal division of selective service headquarters in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.744" offset="7958340">Mr. Mahan is presently a US attorney in the eastern district of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.625" offset="7977880">At the time of the prosecution of this case, Mr. Mahan was the US attorney assigned to prosecute this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.225" offset="8008286">In fact, a motion was made directly prior to the trial to have Mr. Mahan excluded from prosecuting the case and subsequently during the course of the trial, Mr. Mahan appeared as a witness for the Government to detail the facts that I have just gone into before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.792" offset="8098565">On February 24th, Mr. Jenkins did not report for induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.456" offset="8125210">We have not disputed this but later on in March of 1971, Mr. Jenkins did return the CO form to them local board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.221" offset="8164289">No action was taken on that form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.361" offset="8176828">It was in April of 1971 that Ehlert v. United States was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.881" offset="8214862">Ehlert intervened between the date that Mr. Jenkins was to report for induction and return the CO150 form and the date that Mr. Jenkins was subsequently indicted for failure to report for induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.304" offset="8296573">On October 3rd of 1972, the case came to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.284" offset="8320502">We waived trial by jury, the original prosecutor, Mr. Mahan was substituted and the Government presented two witnesses, the executive secretary of the local board in Thomas Mahan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.179" offset="8380061">It is true that before trial, we had asked for 45 days in which to present all motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.268" offset="8424469">No pretrial motions were presented because the selective service file was turned over to us, which gave us all of the discovery that we required in the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.246" offset="8480371">The defense presented three witness, Mr. Jenkins, the defendant, Mr. Jenkins' mother and Mr. Jerome Bobbled who is Mr. Jenkins draft counselor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.998" offset="8539408">However, Mr. Bobbled's testimony was not allowed in the case although we had made an offer approve that Mr. Bobbled would show that Mr. Jenkins was aware of the fact that he could present a CO150 form at this time according to the applicable case law at that time and that Mr. Jenkins believes in opposition to war crystallized after the date that he was ordered to report for induction, but before the date of actual induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.627" offset="8693844">This was pursuant to the applicable case law in the second circuit at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.908" offset="8726967">As I stated, the court excluded Mr. Bobbled's testimony although an offer approve was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.340" offset="8760717">We also had three other witnesses who were character witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.685" offset="8774092">However, we stipulated to their testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.215" offset="8816201">After the trial of the case, Judge Travia requested whether we would like to argue at the particular time as to Mr. Jenkins guilt to innocence of the offense or whether we would prefer to submit findings of fact and conclusions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.573" offset="8917661">We opted for the latter and we submitted findings of fact and conclusions of law proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to Judge Travia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.716" offset="8962278">Several weeks thereafter the judgment was rendered, the Government states that this was a dismissal of an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.373" offset="9020897">In fact in Judge Travia's opinion after findings of fact and after his discussion of the applicable law, Judge Travia did in fact state that the indictment in this case is dismissed and the defendant is discharged.</text>

            <text syncTime="2294.187" offset="9280136">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.005" offset="9287346">Throughout the course of this proceedings however, I was maintaining not simply that on the law, Ehlert v. United States was not retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.988" offset="9355368">In fact, I never made such a broad side attack against Ehlert v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.460" offset="9381177">In fact was that with the peculiar circumstances of Mr. Jenkins case, Mr. Jenkins was represented by council and he had consulted a draft council, but prior to this, he was aware of the applicable case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.992" offset="9471352">The local board received his CO150 form and did not act on it even though Geary at that time requiring that they do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.511" offset="9521403">And Ehlert came down one month after all of these transactions and my position was and I think the position that Judge Travia adopted was it under the peculiar circumstances of Jenkins case that Ehlert v. United States should not be applied to him that in fact Ehlert v. United States would have been unduly harsh in the circumstances of Mr. Jenkins case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.820" offset="9642611">I would like to point out also that Mr. Jenkins did take the stand that during the course of these proceedings while Mr. Jenkins was testifying Judge Travia interrupted my direct examination several times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.704" offset="9722232">In fact, at one point during the direct examination, Judge Travia took over the direct examination and questioned Mr. Jenkins very closely about his sincerity and went in very deeply into Mr. Jenkins credibility in stating that he was in fact a conscientious objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.435" offset="9825155">I have also raised another issue which I did not explore in much debt in brief, but I would like to bring to the court's attention that the trial in this case commenced on October 3rd of 1972, the judgment of the District Court was rendered on October 24th of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.789" offset="9934555">The Government's notice of appeal was filed on November 21st, 1972, its brief however was not filled until June 13th of 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.652" offset="9985964">In his decision dated December 11th of 1973, the Court of Appeals admonished the Government and stated that the Government had not in their view complied with section 3731's mandate that the appeals be diligently prosecuted by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.290" offset="10100485">They stated in a footnote that the delay in appealing the case by the Government – and I quote, they stated this casually conforms with our notion of diligent prosecution and we would have dismissed the appeal on that ground if defendant had so requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.591" offset="10205706">After this decision came down, the Government requested one extension of time to petition for rehearing before the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.686" offset="10262131">Rehearing was denied on February 6 of 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.215" offset="10284283">Later, the Government asked for an extension of time to petition for a writ of certiorari to this Court, and by order of Mr. Justice Marshall on February 28th of 1974, the time for filling for writ of certiorari was extended to April 7th of 1974, the petition being filed on April 8th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.885" offset="10386892">It was on May 28 of 1974 that the petition was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.401" offset="10408939">Again, on July 10th of 1974, the Government requested an extension of time to file the brief to July 24th of 1974, which was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.545" offset="10469543">The brief for the Government was not received by my office until September 17th of 1974.</text>

            <text syncTime="2608.531" offset="10537462">On October 10th of this year, I requested an extension of one month's time to November 14th, 1974.</text>

            <text syncTime="2723.115" offset="10995858">Well I am talking about the original appeal to the Court of Appeals, which I think is what is an issue now whether the Court of Appeals originally had jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.232" offset="11056253">But I am also stating that because of the fact that the Government has not complied with all of the provisions of section 3731 and that they have not diligently prosecuted the appeal that on that separate ground, the original appeal should not have been allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.765" offset="11154474">The Government had made several statements in which they try to take this particular case out of the traditional case of an acquittal being rendered after a trial before a judge or a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.561" offset="11241618">They first make the distinction between a purely legal ruling and the ruling on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.497" offset="11273383">I think this particular distinction is unattainable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.939" offset="11295117">I think that in this particular case, individual facts were conceded by the District Court in making its final ruling that the indictment should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.718" offset="11370245">In fact, the court went very deeply into the facts of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.503" offset="11397413">And again, as I have stated, the court found that under the peculiar circumstances of this case that Jenkins was not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.627" offset="11445896">It stated that under the facts of the case were Jenkins was a priced other law, other second circuit, which differed from other circuits at that time that Jenkins should not be found guilty of refusing to submit to induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.351" offset="11540773">This case should not be any different because a judge made articulated findings of fact and conclusions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.115" offset="11583822">A judge as what is stated in United States v. Mayberry does not have the luxury to issue simply a judgment of not guilty or guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.587" offset="11649755">In fact, he must make findings of fact in conclusions of law, but I submit to you that in this particular case Judge Travia was acting as a fact finder that the finding of fact cannot be limited only to the findings of fact that he articulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.798" offset="11734601">I think he found nine facts in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.834" offset="11762709">But I believe that through his discussion, he indicated that he had gone deeply into this defendants credibility and he indicated that this was part of his decisions that Jenkins would be unduly prejudice by a different finding by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.768" offset="11866467">I could analogize this situation to one that was stated in the Sisson case where the judge had stated to the jury, if you find such facts, then you will render a verdict not guilty and I think it was the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.471" offset="11949223">Judge Travia found such facts articulated in his findings of fact and articulated in his discussion of the law and on the basis of that, he found that Jenkins was not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.884" offset="12018918">If for example, a judge had given erroneous instructions to a jury of if for example, a jury had applied a judge's correct instructions on the law erroneously in the same way, such a verdict from the jury would not be subject to any review as it was stated in United States v. Ball.</text>

            <text syncTime="3007.726" offset="12134275">Mr. Carroll, if the Government should prevail here and the case went back, do you think Judge Travia assuming he would hear it could sit on the findings of fact that were made or would he have to make new ones or additional ones, what is your evaluation of that?</text>

            <label>Mr. James S. Carroll</label>
            <text syncTime="3030.086" offset="12223718">I think that if the court finds that there is jurisdiction in this case, if the case would have to be sent back to Judge Travia for retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.708" offset="12282232">And the reason for that is that the Court of Appeals recognized that an affirmative defense could be asserted that Jenkins had in good faith relied upon the existing case law in the circuit at that time in refusing induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.602" offset="12357778">Now, although I think that Judge Travia did make such a finding, although not expressly articulated or impliedly articulated, I think that the time of trial, Judge Travia believe that it was improper to go into that question at the trial stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.303" offset="12448580">When I asked that Mr. Bobbled, the counselor takes the stand, the Government asked for an offer of proof and when my offer of proof was that Mr. Bobbled would testify as to Mr. Jenkins conversations with him and that Mr. Jenkins believes in opposition to war crystallize after February 4th of 1971, but before February 24th of 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.857" offset="12566758">Judge Travia excluded that testimony because he believed that it would not be relevant and he believe in fact that it would be redundant of what was already in the selective service file.</text>

            <text syncTime="3144.905" offset="12682951">I am also stating that the distinction that the Government makes between a pure legal ruling and findings of fact is not articulated anywhere in the case law and in fact is directly contradicted by the case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.775" offset="12786500">Sisson makes it very clear that the rule of a test is to be used is whether on the basis of facts adduced at the trial going to the general issue of the case, whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty.</text>

            <text syncTime="3204.915" offset="12923068">Would trial be limited to the eviction to have a bench trial or it would be parties all be freed, start from scratch as it were if you decide to have a jury trial they wanted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3224.550" offset="13001540">I imagine that parties would start from scratch, but the first motion that would be made in such a case would be a motion in bar to stop such a trial on the grounds of Double Jeopardy, but I do not think that it is necessary to go that far because I think the appeal in this case alone puts the defendant in Double Jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.340" offset="13100701">I feel that there was an acquittal in this case that any subsequent proceedings in this case put the defendant into Double Jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.154" offset="13143960">I do not think it is necessary for the Government to go to the expense of having this case sent back for another trial when the only thing that would resolve from such a cause would be for that trial to itself be barred by the Double Jeopardy clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="3285.042" offset="13243538">Of course if in fact it goes back, the reason that it will go back is because this Court has said there was Double Jeopardy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3292.495" offset="13273318">That is correct if it does in fact go back, that would be the determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.506" offset="13289409">But I think that in a sense the Government has thrown in a confusing factor by asking whether in fact it would require a new trial or whether a judgment of conviction could simply be entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.195" offset="13372165">I think that is putting a cart before the horse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.369" offset="13384808">The initial question is whether this Court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal and whether the Court of Appeals initially had jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.188" offset="13432142">What would happen subsequently is not directly in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.027" offset="13451473">If this Court does reached the merits of this case however, I submit to you that the ruling of the district judge was correct under the circumstances and that although he was not stating an Ehlert did not apply or cases, he was correct in stating that Ehlert did not apply to the particular situation involved in United States v. Jenkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.913" offset="13579055">I think the Government's appeal is barred by the applicable case law starting with United States v. Ball, continuing to Kepner v. United States and ending up with Fong Foo and Sisson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.595" offset="13669752">The court has stated repeatedly that an appeal alone is barred by the Double Jeopardy clause and that this true whether the trial is before a judge or before a jury and that the test to be used is not whether it was a pure legal ruling or a factual ruling, but whether on the basis of facts adduce a trail, the judge went to the general issue of guilty or not guilty.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="3436.134" offset="13847907">On the question of whether there has to be a retrial, which seems to be focal here, there is absolutely nothing in our appeal which asks on behalf of the Government that there would be a new trial in this case as a result of the correction of error.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3454.417" offset="13921050">Maybe the other side would want one?</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="3456.753" offset="13930350">Maybe they would and maybe they would be entitled to one and if they request one and are entitled too on the Double Jeopardy clause does not preclude that relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.566" offset="13969638">But we are not at that stage and I think it is important to understand the Mercado case and to understand that we do not have here an issue of fact in any significant sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.705" offset="14022196">There is not a shred of evidence in the record in this case nor is there anything in Judge Travia's decision that basis itself on actual reliance by this registrant on the law of the second circuit, I suppose to constructive reliance on the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.715" offset="14094190">There is no reference in fact to reliance on the law but to the unfairness of applying it retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.086" offset="14119685">And as a matter of law, we think Mercado makes it clear that even if he did in fact rely on the prior law of the second circuit, he would have no defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.022" offset="14171512">What the court said in Mercado was upholding the conviction of a register to claims to have relied on preexisting case law would appear to be no more than an application of the settled rule, but an erroneous belief that induction orders in valid even if based on the advise of counsel is not a defense to a prosecution for refusing induction and the one who refuses induction on the basis of such belief acts at his parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.350" offset="14272763">That is the law in second circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.380" offset="14280913">They talked about a possible exception, but it is that exception would be prior to the time of this Courts grant of certiorari in Ehlert because they said that the grant of certiorari in Ehlert cast Geary into sufficient question that nobody could properly relying on the second circuit law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.452" offset="14345174">Jenkins and Mercado were factually situated in the identical circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.059" offset="14363564">Let me say further, there has been a reference to an offer of proof with respect to the draft councilor, Mr. Bobbled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.711" offset="14390209">Now if you look at page 70 of the appendiz, you will exactly what that offer of proof was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.667" offset="14414033">Mr. Carroll said that what Mr. Bobbled would testify to, was that after discussing Mr. Jenkins case with him for some time, Mr. Bobbled elicited from the registrant the fact that he would contentiously oppose to all wars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.265" offset="14476413">And it was only at this time that Mr. Jenkins became aware of this conscientious opposition to all wars and there was further inquiry into this matter of the offer of proof and on page 71, Mr. Carroll said, “I think the sincerity of the registrant is an issue.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.615" offset="14549870">And later on page 73, the court said, “How is he going to change the facts with his testimony.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.904" offset="14570977">Mr. Carroll said he is going to amplify on the sincerity of the registrants beliefs which I state was tested by the local board prior to any type of permissive hearing by the local board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.357" offset="14612773">And the testimony of Mr. Jenkins went to the question of sincerity and that was irrelevant to this issue.</text>
