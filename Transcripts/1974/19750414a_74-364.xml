            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="65.718" offset="366216">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.159" offset="380008">This case is here on the Government's petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for District of Columbia Circuit which reversed respondent's robbery conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.857" offset="426820">Government's evidence against respondent Hale with the trial in this case consisted of four principle matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.718" offset="458271">First, there was the eyewitness identification by the victim Mr. Arrington.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.918" offset="479065">Second, there was the fact that Mr. Arrington had told the police prior to the time Mr. Hale was arrested that one of the robbers might be named Billy Hale.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.406" offset="520965">Third was the fact that Hale's attempted flight when a police officer sought to arrest him after Arrington had identified Hale on the street as one of the robbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.839" offset="570702">Fourth was Hale's possession in his trousers pocket of a $123.00 in cash at the time of his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.714" offset="606229">It's on the latter piece of evidence that this case focuses and that much of the trial focused.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.153" offset="636008">Arrington testified that the robbers took an estimated $96.00 from him but it was taken by co-defendant Anderson and that he sought handed by Anderson to respondent Hale.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.627" offset="689925">One of the arresting officers testified to finding and ceasing the money at the time of Hale's arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.818" offset="714689">It was also brought out that Hale was unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.858" offset="730781">The defense also concentrated on the money found in respondent's possession after the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.986" offset="751365">Six of its seven witnesses testified on that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.006" offset="767352">The defense explanation was that respondent's estranged wife had received her welfare check that morning, cashed it and given $150.00 to respondent for the purpose of purchasing certain money orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.989" offset="823359">She'd written a list on a scrap of paper of the money orders to be purchase which respondent testified he threw away the day after his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.400" offset="864946">At the time of his arrest three or four hours after he had received the money from his wife, respondent testified that he was on his way to buy the money orders that she had requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.409" offset="909040">Closing arguments of counsel also devoted significant attention to the question of the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.483" offset="937253">Now, the particular questioning that led to the reversal of respondent's conviction came during cross-examination of him by the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.486" offset="973302">The prosecutor asked him and this is at page 4 of the appendix, “Did they find some money on you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="223.404" offset="997021">“Yes, they did.”</text>
            <text syncTime="224.831" offset="1002663">“Did you in anyway indicate where that money came from?”</text>
            <text syncTime="228.527" offset="1017501">“No, I didn't.”</text>
            <text syncTime="230.132" offset="1023875">“Why not?”</text>
            <text syncTime="231.477" offset="1029308">“I didn't feel it was necessary at the time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="235.120" offset="1043832">“You were advised of your rights, were you not?”</text>
            <text syncTime="237.685" offset="1054072">“Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="239.400" offset="1060968">At that point, the court interjected, stated that he is not required to indicate where the money came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.608" offset="1085837">There is no responsibility on his part in regarding to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.368" offset="1100884">And then in response to objections by defense counsel, the court further stated -- indicated to the jury that it is clearly an inappropriate question.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.050" offset="1135574">“You may disregard it ladies and gentlemen.”</text>
            <text syncTime="260.584" offset="1145710">The defendant is not required to give any explanation whatsoever at the time of his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.481" offset="1181341">Court of Appeals found this questioning to be improper and reverse the conviction because of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.190" offset="1216136">Now on analyzing this case, there are two distinct questions which I think it's important to keep separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.156" offset="1239960">The first is whether respondent's silence at the time he was arrested was so lacking in probative value, that its disclosure to the jury was more likely to impede than to foster a factually accurate verdict by the jury.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="299.011" stopTime="306.264">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="299.011" offset="1299414">Did the district judge give that admonition to the jury without on his own, without any request from the part of the --</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="306.264" offset="1328462">Well, he initially interrupted the questioning without any objection by defense counsel to indicate that it was an improper question.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.624" offset="1361899">There then was a request that the question and answer be stricken, and he responded by telling the jury that they may disregard it, I'm not sure what that -- how the jury took that.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.920" offset="1411009">There was a harmless error contention raised in the Court of Appeals and it was rejected and we have not petition on the question of whether the error, if there was one was harmless in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.303" offset="1464613">Now, the second question apart from the probative value prejudicial effect question is whether even if the disclosure of respondent's silence was likely to contribute to an accurate verdict, there is some overwriting constitutional policy dictating that a preference be accorded to suppression of the evidence, even at the expense of the truth seeking function of the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="727.706" offset="3014196">Well, I understand that the fact of his possession of the money was already in evidence, but what was also an evidenced at the point that this cross-examination took place was his explanation of how he came to have the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.961" offset="3067173">Now, the Court of Appeals said there was nothing inconsistent as I think you're suggesting between his silence at the police station and his explanation at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.192" offset="3120149">We don't agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.697" offset="3126209">We think it's important to inquire into what is meant by the word inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.074" offset="3147630">The Court of Appeals and respondent here use it to mean necessarily contradictory;</text>
            <text syncTime="765.513" offset="3165393">that is that the testimony and the prior inconsistency can't both be true, and they seek to distinguish cases like Harris and Walder on the grounds that there, there was that kind of inconsistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.956" offset="3231222">Now, the question is in order to be probative for impeachment purposes must the evidence be wholly and inevitably inconsistent or does it suffice if it's probably inconsistent, if it tends to impeach the witness's testimony, now we think that the latter is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.104" offset="3299767">And in this connection, I refer the Court to the definition of relevant evidence which is contained in Rule 401 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.911" offset="3331009">Relevant evidence is there to find as evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.931" offset="3391091">Applying that standard here, it's clear that respondent's prior silence should have been admitted as having at least some tendency to show that his testimony at trial was not truthful.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.425" offset="3437066">In this connection, I'd like to advert to what Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in his concurring opinion in Adamson against California about this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.906" offset="3474996">It said sensible and just-minded man in important affairs of life deemed it significant that a man remains silent when confronted with serious and responsible evidence against himself which it is within his power to contradict.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.785" offset="3534555">The notion that to allow jurors to do that with sensible and right-minded man do everyday violates the immutable principles of justices conceived by a civil life society is to trivialize the importance of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.704" offset="3590144">To deny that the jury can be trusted to make such discrimination, that is assess the reasons for silence is to show little confidence in the jury system.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.494" offset="3633298">This is an empirical question and the degree to which silence tends to impeach is subsequently proffered explanation will vary from case to case.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.916" offset="3674990">Here, its impeaching effect is high.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.828" offset="3690663">If Hale's testimony at trial was true, it seems to us and we think it would have seen to the jury extremely unlikely that he would have failed to tell the same story to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.137" offset="3739878">By telling the story, by explaining to the police what happen at the time, he would have capitalize on an opportunity possibly to prevent prosecution all together, or at the very least to neutralize a damaging piece of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.504" offset="3797347">This opportunity was evanescent if he didn't tell the police at that time where this money came from, he could never afterwards convince the police that his subsequent explanation was not fabricated.</text>

            <text syncTime="964.783" offset="3962546">It was clear that she had received the money that day, and then of course that was her word and Hale's that she had given the money to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.752" offset="3998386">Now finally, a point that I think is very significant in assessing whether his silence was probative, whether it would have meant anything to a rational jury is the fact that it seems to me most unlikely that somebody in Hale's situation would have sat quietly by, let the police take from him the money which belong to his wife which was her welfare check, which was all the money that she and their two children had to live on for the next month, and would simply have said absolutely nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.725" offset="4122311">Of course, he had a right to say nothing, but that's not the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.607" offset="4137775">The issue was whether it was likely under those circumstances that he would have said nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.949" offset="4159195">If it was unlikely under those circumstances that he would have said nothing, then surely, it bears substantially on the veracity of his testimony to let the jury know.</text>

            <text syncTime="1123.946" offset="4599202">The jury never knew that he was asked; that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.986" offset="4615293">I mean I picture further cross-examination would have gone into the kind of thing such as, could you stand there quietly and let them take your wife's welfare money, and then he might say well, I knew I wouldn't get it back anyway, and then the jury could see whether they believed him and when he gave the explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.285" offset="4692511">Now, it's instructive here to compare the Grunewald case on which the Court of Appeals relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.433" offset="4713096">What this Court did in Grunewald was it looked at the answers that Mr. Grunewald gave a trial that the testimony that -- or rather help her in the defendant who was involved in that aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.348" offset="4760743">They looked at the answers and they said “Indeed, these answers could have been incriminating if they have been given to the grand jury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.820" offset="4790627">Therefore, under the other circumstances which we've adverted to in our brief, we think it has not probative value in the special circumstances of this case that he invoked the Fifth Amendment before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.227" offset="4852276">But let's look here at what it is that Mr. Hale said, a completely exculpatory statement, a statement which if true couldn't possibly have gotten him into trouble, if true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.542" offset="4917582">Now also in terms of prejudicial effect, there is a distinction between this case and Grunewald.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.668" offset="4942033">Grunewald involved the balancing as this traditionally, the function of the trial court between the probative value and any potential prejudicial effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.364" offset="4984874">In Grunewald, in light of the conditions at the time with regard to the Fifth Amendment and this was in the height of the McCarthy era, the court felt that to tell the jury that the witness had taken the Fifth Amendment before the grand jury was to introduce a substantial risk of prejudice that the jury would impermissibly conclude from that that he must have been guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.850" offset="5086751">Here, no but the jury was not told this line of questioning did not suggest any claim of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.583" offset="5117680">This line of questioning did not even indicate whether he was otherwise silent before the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.980" offset="5139310">It was sharply focused on a particular inquiry by the police and on a particular piece of his testimony to with his explanation of the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.069" offset="5183613">Under these circumstances, there was very, very little hazard of prejudicial effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.245" offset="5208377">Now, I've deferred discussion of the Fifth Amendment issues, both because they have been considered it greater length in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.596" offset="5241710">And because I don't believe that properly analyzed, this is really a Fifth Amendment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.083" offset="5263653">Court of Appeals based its holding on Griffin and on Miranda, but neither of those cases we submit supports the result that it reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.873" offset="5302836">Griffin is critically different because it involved the non-testifying defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.440" offset="5325093">Thus, it was not concerned as he with specific impeachment use of silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.027" offset="5347453">The whole truth policy of the Harris line of cases was implicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.729" offset="5370337">Nor was the waiver concept of Raffel implicated in the Griffin situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.604" offset="5397817">Moreover in this case unlike Griffin, respondent had the opportunity to explain his silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.969" offset="5423208">The non-testifying defendant at the criminal trial has no such opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.957" offset="5447241">Also, I think its a little clearer the Griffin's refusal to take the stand was an invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege in the sense that Hale's silence was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.297" offset="5496560">Now, the Miranda dictum I submit was also not intended to apply to impeachment use of silence, rather it was a reference to use in the case in Chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.792" offset="5558523">In summary, we think that this case fits within the Ruff or Harris line of cases in which this Court has rejected Fifth Amendment claims of a testifying defendant emphasizing the importance of fully testing the truthfulness of a defendant's testimony of getting the whole truth rather than the defendant's tailored version of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.714" offset="5642219">It's recognized in those cases that the protection of the Fifth Amendment are intended for the benefit of those who do not wish to testify and not for the benefit of those who as Hale do wish to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.738" offset="5698330">On one final note I'd like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.568" offset="5713690">A ruling in favor of the Government's position in this case will not have any effect of encouraging police misconduct in interrogating arrested suspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.298" offset="5756531">We could compare this case with the arguments that were made in the recently decided case of Oregon against Hass where the dissent took the position that there would not be any impediment to the police once a request for counsel had been made to persist in their questioning since they had everything to gain and nothing to lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.186" offset="5840123">The court nevertheless felt that the whole truth policy of the Harris line of cases was of overriding importance there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.115" offset="5871783">Here however, we have a situation in which the police far from being given an incentive to coerce the statement are given a situation in which even if the defendant remain silent, there may be some prosecute of benefit down the road from such a chain of events, so that to extent that there is any tendency here to affect police conduct, the tendency will be to enforce the duty or reinforce the duty of the police to give this arrested suspect of free choice between voluntarily remaining silent and voluntarily speaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.974" offset="6027264">Mr. Hale had that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.285" offset="6040534">Finally, I'd like to mention to the Court the Barnes case which had decided two terms ago on 412 U.S. at 846.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.308" offset="6072613">We didn't include that in our brief, but I think there are some parallels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.035" offset="6095496">That case involved the question of the inference that could be drawn from possession of recently stolen goods, unexplained possession of recently stolen goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.358" offset="6144815">There was a Fifth Amendment contention that this put pressure on a defendant to proffer an explanation of his possession since otherwise the jury would be told they could infer his guilt from unexplained possession and the court rejected that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.188" offset="6212106">Also, I'd like to point out that at page 31 of the respondent's brief, they rely on the case called Miranti, and that case has been limited to its facts by a subsequent Second Circuit decision in United States against Sewald, 450 F. 2d 1129.</text>

            <text syncTime="1592.079" offset="6471659">I think the jury ought to understand in the context of evaluating a defendant's silence that he has been given Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.249" offset="6504364">It would be appropriate for the defendant to explain that if that's his explanation for his silence, for his counsel to bring it out on redirect, or even for the court to instruct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1859.619" offset="7541844">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.910" offset="7555009">Prior to discussing whether the impeachment here was really proper impeachment and I don't think it's important to follow up on the few other points that were just made with regard to the prejudice that was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.828" offset="7606732">We disagree that the Fifth Amendment isn't involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.050" offset="7623555">Indeed, we think the issue is whether the Fifth Amendment was violated by the prosecution placing before the jury, this evidence of the defendants' prior silence at the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.311" offset="7676635">The privilege gives the accused the right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.519" offset="7697429">That right extends to both innocent and guilty alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.120" offset="7711848">The reason for that policy underlying the Fifth Amendment really has nothing to do with protecting the guilty, rather, the privilege exist to protect our system of criminal justice, the accusatory system, in which the Government has the burden of proving guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.958" offset="7803173">They must shoulder the entire load without any help from the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.773" offset="7826474">Such a system represents a fair state individual balance and that it protects the individual from possible inhumane treatment by the Government and trying to secure statements from him which could be use against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.254" offset="7908394">It also insures the dignity of the individual by insuring the individual a right to privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.982" offset="7939323">He doesn't have to respond to the questions of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.944" offset="7955101">He doesn't have to dignify those questions, those accusations by responding to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.434" offset="7981119">Unfortunately, most laymen don't know or don't understand the policy reasons behind underlying the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.276" offset="8028453">The silence of the accused at the time of his arrest is probably all too often equated with guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.068" offset="8067636">There is that possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.601" offset="8081742">It was for that reason that the no comment rule was really made a part of the Fifth Amendment by the Griffin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.336" offset="8116746">If the defendant elects to remain silent, then the prosecution can't comment on that silence because of the danger that the jury will draw that impermissible inference of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.763" offset="8170454">The privilege would really be meaningless if the defendant had the right to remain silent, and then the prosecution could bring out that silence to be use against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.175" offset="8228028">That danger is present whether the silence is brought out and the case in Chief, whether it's brought out in closing argument, whether it's brought out on cross-examination in impeaching the jury, silence is still before the jury and the jury still may draw the impermissible inference of guilt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2067.862" offset="8374836">That's -- the jury sees that and is aware of it and nobody can prevent whatever inference they may draw from being drawn, isn't that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="3529.047" offset="14219577">You can certainly see that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.442" offset="14225115">Everybody else will assume the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.546" offset="14237550">That sort of statement by the police was viewed in Miranda as amounting to a form of psychological coercion, and I think it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.040" offset="14275584">If the Government seeks against the rule they seek today, then the police could properly tell the accused that, would be a proper statement to give.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.808" offset="14330650">That would result in a great deal of pressure being placed on the defendant's right to remain silent at the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.596" offset="14397733">He can invoke that right to remain silent, only on the condition that it may be use in evidence against him and impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.455" offset="14453217">It seems to me that puts a great deal of pressure on him to talk, to give up his right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.943" offset="14479130">It does result in a cost at exact cause on the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.575" offset="14517687">I think the Government in the relying on Williams and McGautha and Barnes, really overlooks the fact that in those cases where trial tactics was often discussed, the defendant had counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.782" offset="14582471">Here, the defendant is just been arrested at the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.485" offset="14593337">He did not have counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.419" offset="14601070">This was in a question of trial tactics on his part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.962" offset="14615176">He didn't have counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.228" offset="14624266">He didn't have any idea, yet maybe what his defense would be he hadn't conferred with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.715" offset="14646209">I think there's a great deal of difference between this case and between with the cases of McGautha and Williams and Barnes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.921" offset="14707022">As far as waiver is concerned, the Government argues that by taking the stand, he waived his right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.607" offset="14749759">In a single proceeding obviously, taking the stand will waive the right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.946" offset="14767208">He must answer the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.381" offset="14772851">He must not evade questions directed to him by the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.211" offset="14796257">If he does, then the jury could possibly infer guilt and maybe rightly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.259" offset="14816423">But here, we're talking about two separate proceedings;</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.982" offset="14827290">the right to remain silent at the time of arrest and the right to remain silent as his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.004" offset="14859368">There is no reason for the waiver about taking the stand to be a retroactive waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.190" offset="14884133">In the Raffel case which is relied on black counsel, the only basis which was suggested for extending this scope of the waiver are against extending the scope of the waiver was the possible pressure on the defendant to testify this first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.919" offset="14963022">The court rejected that because that pressure really wouldn't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.939" offset="14983084">He wouldn't be expected to have a second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.643" offset="14997922">He couldn't anticipate that he would get a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.230" offset="15020283">Here on the other hand at the police station, he may well expect to have a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.044" offset="15047555">He is probably looking forward to one.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="3914.797" offset="15762578">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.460" offset="15762474">I'll try to be quick.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.005" offset="15762369">The reason are my opponent can't rely on Grunewald Mr. Justice Powell, said I think on a fair reading of Grunewald, it more closely supports us than them, the kind of analysis in which the court engaged in Grunewald would not lead to the same conclusion as applied to the facts from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.809" offset="15762265">With respect to what Mr. Hale could reasonably infer from the warning that was given to him at the time he was arrested, I don't think he could reasonably infer that his silence wouldn't hurt him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3817.975" offset="15762160">There are many ways in which his silence would hurt him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.147" offset="15762056">His silence would cause him to be charge with a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.239" offset="15761951">His silence would cause him to lose the opportunity to neutralize the piece of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.147" offset="15761847">His silence might cause him to lose whatever opportunity he had to get this money back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.626" offset="15761742">The silence carries many prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.000" offset="15761638">The price of possible impeachment if he's brought to trial and if he decides to testify by his silence, it seems to me a very remote one, very unlikely to control his conduct that the time extremely unlikely to put impermissible pressure on him in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.341" offset="15761533">And I think it's important to note that his silence was not the product of any violation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.671" offset="15761429">Obviously, his right to remain silent was honored and even there, I think that it's -- by no means clear that what was referred to in Miranda is the right to remain silent is actually a Fifth Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.932" offset="15761324">You have a right not to be compelled to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3881.195" offset="15761220">In Michigan against Tucker suggest that that right is somewhat different and somewhat more narrow and it might be more accurate if the Miranda warnings instead of describing a right to remain silent advised the arrestee that he has no obligation to speak or perhaps that he can't be compelled to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.983" offset="15761115">In any event, I think there was no real likelihood of prejudicial effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.732" offset="15761011">By prejudicial effect, what is meant is that the jury will impermissibly draw the improper conclusion and I don't think that could be the case here.</text>
