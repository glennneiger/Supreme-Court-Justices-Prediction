            <text syncTime="45.998" offset="287326">Exemption three to the Freedom of Information Act covers matters that are specifically exempted from disclosure by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.577" offset="329644">The question in this case which is here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is whether by this provision Congress contended to continue in effect the large number of prior and existing federal statutes which provided for non disclosure of Government material on various terms and conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.241" offset="432358">Rather than, as the Court of Appeals held is limited to particular statutes would specify the particular material involved and which provide a more specific standard for non disclosure than the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.336" offset="500694">The case involves certain documents produced by the Federal Aviation Administration which it does pursuant to its Systems Worthiness Analysis Program which I shall refer to by its commonly accepted acronym of (SCRAP).</text>
            <text syncTime="118.652" offset="578017">What these reports are, are the result of a program that the Federal Aviation Administration conducts involving a detailed study and analysis of air carrier systems.</text>

            <text syncTime="143.267" offset="676446">SWAP.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.708" offset="686164">It involves a detailed study and analysis of the operations and the maintenance programs of the carriers to ascertain whether the carriers own programs are functioning properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.211" offset="744260">The purpose of the program is to try to uncover before they mature anything that might lead to an unsafe operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.654" offset="781981">A major aspect of this program is free and frank discussion between the team of FAA people, the SWAP team that conducts the investigation and the management of the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.550" offset="845615">They discuss the thing, they analyze the problem, they point out the difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.618" offset="869857">In an affidavit on filing this case that is uncontroverted by Mr. Shaffer, the administrator of FAA which is set forth to pages 40 to 42 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.061" offset="919594">He explains how this thing operates and the importance of the informal frank discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.273" offset="948433">He said the -- this is page 40, paragraph six, “A SWAP investigative team works in close cooperation with airline management, defined any area of maintenance, operations, management or overall performance which needs improvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.924" offset="1015097">The system depends upon the frank and full disclosure of the airline.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.014" offset="1035473">It also points out that the information investigated includes financial and operational matters which would not customarily be released to the public and that much of the material is of the nature which would not be disclosed to competitors.”</text>
            <text syncTime="248.141" offset="1095973">And then in paragraph number 12 on page 41, he says, “The SWAP Program operates with the understanding between the airlines and the FAA that the information will not be disclosed to the public.”</text>
            <text syncTime="263.372" offset="1156890">At the end of the SWAP investigation which may take anywhere from two weeks to much longer and as conducted by team of four or five people, a final report is made in which detailed findings are made, the problems of the carrier analyze and recommendations are proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.415" offset="1228988">Now, neither the report nor the informational findings in it is made available to the public although as Mr. Shaffer said at page 42 of the record in his affidavit, the findings made by the SCRAP Team are frequently disclosed to the carrier management in order to enable that it'll be the kind of frank discussion that is necessary and to enable the carrier to take corrective action.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.785" offset="1338493">The respondent in this case, Mr. Robertson is connected with the Center for the Study of Responsive Law and as director of the Aviation Consumer Action Product -- Project.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.771" offset="1390425">In December of 1970, this group was conducting a study of airline safety and they requested the Federal Aviation Administration to make available to them all of the SWAP Reports for 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.948" offset="1451133">The administration refused to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.930" offset="1463045">They file a petition for rehearing and while a petition for rehearing was pending, the air carrier industry appearing for the Air Transport Association, its trade association requested the administrator under Section 1104 of the Federal Aviation Act not to disclose this material.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.882" offset="1558862">Section 1104 which is set out at pages three to four of our brief provides that in response to a written objection to disclosure of either information contained in an application report or document filed with either the Civil Aeronautics Board of the Federal Aviation Administration and I will refer in this case only to the administration or information that the administration is obtained pursuant to the act when such a written objection is made, the administrator shall order the information withheld from public disclosure when in his judgment a disclosure of the information would adversely affect the interest of the person seeking non disclosure and is not required in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.848" offset="1754781">The letter by which the Air Transport Association requested the administration to keep this information confidential as set forth at pages 112 to 113 of the record and in that letter, they'd point out that the information which they give to the SWAP Teams during the investigation voluntarily is not required to be disclosed by any regulation of the Federal Aviation Administration and they said, “If public disclosure of the SWAP reports were made, the interest of aviation safety would be endangered of being subordinated in some degree to legal considerations and the presentation of information to the FAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.542" offset="1933563">They also pointed out that the present informal practice of frank and free discussion said encourages a spirit of openness on the part of airline management which is vital to the promotion of aviation safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.099" offset="1995734">On the basis filing this submission, the administrator made a determination under Section 1104 which is set forth at page 115 of the record deciding not to make public to SWAP Reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.194" offset="2056129">He made the determination in the language of the statute that disclosure of the information in the reports would adversely affect the interest of the airline being investigated and is not required in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.166" offset="2112031">Following this determination, the FAA denied reconsideration of the respondent's request for the SWAP Reports, the suit was brought, the District Court ordered disclosure of the SWAP reports and a divided Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.871" offset="2178905">The majority held two things basically.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.873" offset="2186846">First, it held that the reference in Section 1104, the material specifically exempted from disclosure by statute was only applicable if the statute itself specify the documents or categories of documents and authorizes to be withheld and it said that 1104 didn't come within this because it didn't specify any particular class of documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.313" offset="2284648">Secondly, it said that the standard in Section 1104 of the public interest was not a specific exemption by statute within the meaning of Exemption 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.913" offset="2327071">There was a dissenting opinion by Judge Rob in which he referred to the legislative history which I will elude to shortly, pointing out that the strong congressional intent in Exemption 3 to continue the effectiveness of this large number of statutes and he said, he didn't believe in the light of that that Exemption 3 could be viewed as repealing by implication the specific provisions of Section 1104.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.994" offset="2443368">Now, the Freedom of Information Act was enacted because of the satisfaction with the way the old public information section of the Administrative Procedure Act had worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.173" offset="2504077">There was considerable feeling in Congress and elsewhere that under the statute, the public was not being furnished the information that was entitled to received and one serious floor as this Court pointed out in its Mink opinion two terms ago was one of the provisions of that statute which permitted to the withholding from disclosure of material relating to any function of the United States requiring secrecy in the public interest and it was felt that this standard which was a general standard covering the whole gambit of Government operation just didn't provide any guidelines that Government officials could easily say, “We think it's not in the public interest to disclose and then keep it secret.”</text>
            <text syncTime="644.490" offset="2681292">The response Congress gave in the Freedom of Information Act was generally, generally to open up all identifiable Government records to disclosure but subject to nine specific exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.474" offset="2737298">And of course, the nine specific exemptions dealing with various areas reflected a recognition that the effective operation of Government requires in some instances that material be kept confidential in order to permit the Government to function properly.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="679.995" offset="2823398">And if you should not prevail on that when you still may -- when you're case underwent or any other of the exemptions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="freidman" startTime="686.537" stopTime="1179.425">
            <label>Mr. Freidman</label>
            <text syncTime="686.537" offset="2849520">We may Mr. Justice because the exemption sometimes overlap but we think on this issue, we think that we are entitled to prevail under Exemption 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.203" offset="2892152">Now of the nine exemptions that Congress created, seven of them contain their own standards, two of them however do not; Exemption 3 and Exemption 1 which this Court had before in the Mink case which referred to matter specifically required by executive order to be kept confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.096" offset="2975744">The two provisions, these were Exemption 3 and Exemption 1 in effect incorporate by reference other standards of confidentiality which reflected in one case in an executive order and the other case in statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.991" offset="3035303">Now, at the time that the Freedom of Information Act was enacted in 1966 therein existence a large number of Government statutes, the numbers are uncertain, there are some references in the legislative history to 80, 78, almost a hundred but these are all statutes in which Congress specifically dealing with a particular problem had concluded that Government information should be kept confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.703" offset="3146167">The terms of these statutes vary.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.973" offset="3155257">In some instances, they provided generally that the material was to be made public unless it was determined by the administrative agency or the Government official who should be kept confidential as in this case, other instances there are for situations in which the statute provided that the material was to be generally kept confidential unless the Government official decided that it should be made public.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.326" offset="3252642">The terms varied also whether it dealt with the general categories of material or dealt with specific material and it also varied with respect to the basis upon which the Government official would act.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.071" offset="3307708">Now, we think the legislative history shows in the background and the Freedom of Information Act shows that when Congress in Exemption 3 referred to material specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, what it meant to do was to preserve intact all of these existing statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.984" offset="3395271">It used we think the words specifically exempted, not in terms that the statute specify the particular documents to be withheld as the Court of Appeals held as our opponents argue but that the statute, it was the statute that specified non disclosure in terms rather than merely implying it that is a statute which would be relied upon because of the public policy reflected in the statute as by implication sanctioning non disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.165" offset="3516061">The purpose -- the purpose of Exemption 3 and the purpose of the whole Freedom of Information Act was to eliminate the prior practice under the Administrative Procedure Act by which all Government officials could just keep anything they wanted secret on a simple decision that it was required in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.853" offset="3602787">We have set forth considerable detail in our brief the legislative history of Exemption 3 and each shows that over a period of eight years during which Congress considered a number of bills containing this identical language that the Congress was aware that there are large number of these statutes and that Congress intended not to change them, to keep them intact, to leave them as they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.692" offset="3710098">Let me just refer to two items which I think show this rather clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.227" offset="3728280">In the 1966 House Committee Report which we've quoted at page 18 of our brief which was the report on the bill actually enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.381" offset="3764851">The committee stated that there are nearly 100 statutes or parts of statutes which restrict public access to specific Government records.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.812" offset="3798601">This would not be modified by the public records provision of S. 1160 which is the bill ultimately enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.372" offset="3828903">Then over on page 19 as a statement by Senator Hruska during the 1963 hearings at an earlier phase of the consideration of these litigation, I'm sorry Senator Long, I stand corrected who was one of the sponsors and proponents of the Bill and what he said was, “Statutes which curtail the availability of information to the public are not intended to be affected by the enactment of this bill and two sentences after than, it should be made clear that this bill in no way limits statutes specifically written with the congressional intent of curtailing the flow of information as a supplement necessary to the proper functioning of certain agencies.”</text>
            <text syncTime="973.475" offset="3997236">In other words, what Congress was doing here was it was deferring to the judgment of earlier legislative bodies made as result of specific consideration of the particular problem, it was deferring to their judgment that in certain situations that was to be non disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.072" offset="4095666">It did not intend, we think very clearly by Exemption 3 to repeal by implication any of these existing statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.618" offset="4133804">We think the case does closely parallels the Mink case where in the Mink case it was argued that because the executive order that was relied on is the basis for classifying the material secret and top secret did not itself refer to the particular documents the claim was they are not covered by Exemption 1 that this Court rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.799" offset="4226591">Similarly it seems to us here the fact that the particular statutes may not have been as detailed and specificity may vary considerably that's no basis for saying that Congress didn't intend them to be covered or the Congress intended in each instance for the Court considering this and I add for the administrative official having to make the decision whether to disclose for him to try to figure out whether the particular statute was specific enough to bring it within the coverage of Exemption 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.322" offset="4376639">Congress was not making that kind of a determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.052" offset="4391581">Congress was adapting all of these many, many statues that have previously been enacted and was leading him as they worth, it said in effect, “We will accept what other Congresses have concluded when they specifically dealt with a particular problem.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.613" offset="4465873">Now, our opponents tell us it's inconsistent with the determination that Congress made in the Freedom of Information Act to eliminate the old public interest standard under the Administrative Procedure Act while at the same time to have intended to permit the nondisclosure material under the standard in Section 1104 which refers to the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.640" offset="4577886">We think there's a very significant difference between it because in 1104, Congress made a specific determination with respect to the circumstances under which the material of the Federal Aviation Administration was to be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.714" offset="4646222">They weren't saying, this wasn't part of a program under which everybody could disclose. Congress made the determination way back in 1938 when it first enacted the Civil Aeronautics Act that when there was a protest to material in the hands of the Federal Aviation Administration, that it was up to the administrator with his expert judgment to balance on the one hand the entry that would result to the people protesting the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.851" offset="4750817">That is the adverse affect upon the people who were protesting and on the other hand, the public interest in disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.306" offset="4780596">It left it to the administrator to make that balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.552" offset="4801599">That is Congress and this statue specifically focused on this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.049" offset="4819571">And we --</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="1179.425" offset="4821034">Prior to the Freedom of Information Act to the 1966, the Federal Aviation Administrator could've withheld either under the standard of the old Freedom of Information Act or under the 1938 Statute, is that correct?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="freidman" startTime="1194.042" stopTime="1231.502">
            <label>Mr. Freidman</label>
            <text syncTime="1194.042" offset="4879548">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.461" offset="4881220">He may have had to make a somewhat different determination under the old Freedom of Information Act, I'm sorry under the old administrative procedure but he certainly could've withheld under this statute and now would've been no basis on which I don't think that could've been obtained prior to the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.506" offset="4945377">So, the basic argument of course is that somehow in Exemption 3, when they spoke of a material specifically exempted from disclosure and statue, they've somehow by implication repeal the provision of 1104 and we don't think that's what Congress intended, we think that Congress intended to Continuality Statutes Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1282.308" offset="5232619">It seems to me as a basis for keeping it confidential and that's the provision that Congress provided almost 40 years ago and we therefore think that the administrator correctly in this case that the SWAP Reports are materials specifically exempted from disclosure under Exemption 3 and that therefore the respondents are not entitled to obtain.</text>

            <text syncTime="1443.271" offset="5876485">The Congress made the legislative judgments in 1966 as to what ought to be withheld as being in the public interest and everything else had to be disclosed, it was in everything had to be disclosed but for the specific exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.774" offset="5934477">So, the respondents wanted these documents for two reasons; one, to check on the airlines themselves, to see whether the airlines were doing what they could to prevent actions from taking place before they took place, and second to see whether the FAA was doing its job keeping an eye on the airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.721" offset="6010232">And while their request was administratively pending, the ATA, the Air Transport Association on behalf of 28 airlines on be known to the respondents sent a two-page letter to the FAA which is reproduced at pages 112 and 113 of the appendix and they simply said, “We invoke 1104 and ask you to invoke 1104 to prohibit these documents from being disclosed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.255" offset="6116394">Section 1104 permits two agencies and only two agencies of the Government; the FAA for safety and the CAB for economic regulation matters relating to the airlines to withhold from the public any document that those agencies see fit if they make the determination that to release the documents is not required in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.085" offset="6207718">Now, without the knowledge of the respondents and without asking for their position, the FAA simply based on these two-page conclusory letter ruled that all past, present, and future SWAP Reports that might be prepared by any administrator or under his direction of the FAA from now or hereafter were to be exempt if not in the public interest regardless of the special need, regardless of the special circumstances or anything whatsoever, it was almost a rule forever and ever --</text>

            <text syncTime="1950.139" offset="7903901">There was no formal ruling and indeed the specific request of the ATA in this case to hold these things confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.385" offset="7932949">Belies the notion that it was a generally accepted practice that even that not withstanding the Freedom of Information Act, it could be withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.499" offset="7961370">Incidentally, in that regard, I may point out that the fact that a particular individual may have expected the Government to keep the document confidential is of course no defense to a request under the Freedom of Information Act or the Congress is overwritten that and a private agreement between a particular individual and the Government is not itself a reason unless the document otherwise comes within one of the exemptions to the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.443" offset="8065128">Based upon the determination by the FAA that 1104 applied and that ought to be invoked, the respondents request was denied and based upon the three other exemptions I mentioned earlier, the respondent's final administrative remedies were exhausted and this action thereafter ensued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.817" offset="8150601">The District Court rejected all of the defenses are raised by the petitioners and the Court of Appeals ruled solely on the Exemption 3 claim and therefore that's the only issue we have before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.713" offset="8198248">It remanded the matter for further proceedings with respect to the other defenses raised by the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2050.797" offset="8306604">Even though these reports are not mentioned in Section 1104 and the basis for withholding them is the determination by the head of the FAA that the public interest does not require their disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.377" offset="8364910">We suggest that if the position of the Government is a date adopted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.348" offset="8380792">The result would be a creation of a wholesale exception the Freedom of Information Act for these two agencies; the FAA for safety and the CAB for economics.</text>

            <text syncTime="2092.900" offset="8474937">Moreover, the result in this situation that the Government urges here is inconsistent with the intent in Congress in repealing former Section 3 of the APA and enacting Freedom of Information Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2118.804" offset="8578591">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.559" offset="8589563">The result that the plaintiffs and respondents are urging in this case is supported amply by an examination of the overall congressional purpose in enacting the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.882" offset="8638882">This purpose was plainly to replace the vast administrative discretion that was available under the old APA Section 3 to withhold and which ran rapid under that statute so that as this Court said in Mink the statute became more of a withholding of then a disclosing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.152" offset="8700008">And Congress decided that if rather than the agency should decide what documents ought to be disclosed and where the public interest lay in specific situations and it did this in the following way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.356" offset="8748805">It said that all documents were to be disclosed except for those specifically exempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.913" offset="8771062">It setup nine specific exemptions in Section 552(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.272" offset="8788511">Now, for eight of these, Congress that wrote the Freedom of Information Act in 1966 set forth those standards and I include in those eight, Exemption 1 because the important thing about Exemption 1 is although it made reference to an executive order, it was an executive order which permitted withholding only in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and that in our view readily distinguishes it from the kind of open-ended statute we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.227" offset="8904286">It makes the national defense standard of Exemption 1 similar to other kind of standards that are set forth in the other provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, although, in fact the mechanism for bringing it about or somewhat different but basically there is a congressional imposition of a standard there adjust as there was a congressional imposition of a standard regarding the other substantive exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.805" offset="8994565">Now, with respect to the last exemption, Exemption number 3, the one we have before this Court, the Court decided that -- the Congress decided that rather than striking a new balance between where the public interest lay where the Congress had previously spoken, it decided to defer to the judgment of prior congresses and that is by going back and saying we'll continue in effect prior statutory exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.080" offset="9099682">We won't second guess the determination's specific judgments made by the prior Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.410" offset="9120998">Indeed the Government's reply brief in this Court said that what Congress was really doing was that it decide it would not attempt to reexamine or distinguish prior legislative judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.043" offset="9171571">The question we have to ask here is “was there the kind of legislative judgment in Section 1104 given the fact that it's so open ended with both respect to the kind of documents and the standards for disclosure?”</text>
