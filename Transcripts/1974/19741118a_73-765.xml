            <text syncTime="39.207" offset="260159">The question of this case presents is whether an employer may coerce and an employee to participate in an interview with that employer unaided by a union representative where the outcome of the interview is reasonably believed by the employee to subject him to the risk of disciplinary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.520" offset="369455">More specifically in terms of this case, an employee is called in to talk to the employer and the Board finds that the employee reasonably fears disciplinary action may that employer fire the employee because she refuses to submit to a private interview?</text>
            <text syncTime="89.900" offset="462973">May that employer fire the two employee representatives or fellow employees who are the shop ladies in the shop because they seek to provide the representation requested of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="109.570" offset="541654">Well, I should say the Trial Examiner did find that the agreement was not silent on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.215" offset="568195">The Trial Examiner construed the agreement to mean that by agreement, the employer was required to confer the representation in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.392" offset="608946">We don't think that's determinative but if the agreement were silent or if the agreement certainly is as construed here that is the question that is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.574" offset="645622">We don't have in other words an agreement which bars union representation.</text>

            <text syncTime="153.163" offset="716048">Well, no it wouldn't even go beyond that because our view would be that concerted activity for a mutual aid or protection would exist even they -- though there were no union in the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.863" offset="762859">Suppose for example an employee is called in to a private interview in which he reasonably fears subjection to discipline because she fears if she asked let's say fellow employee to come along with her.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.459" offset="817194">In our view, that is concerted activity when that fellow employee is willing to furnish the aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.236" offset="844361">She expects or she can surely be expected to suppose that when her turn comes she will be helped so that even in a non-union situation, helping the other employee is concerted activity for mutual aid or protection.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bernard Dunau</label>
            <text syncTime="208.522" offset="937462">But it is not an employment at will in the sense that when an employee is exercising a statutory right that that employee may be fired for exercising that right and that statutory right concerted activity for mutual aid or protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.945" offset="999111">One employee asked again another to assist him in meeting with the employer as concerted activity for mutual aid or protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="267.404" offset="1172982">But it's at the option of the fellow employee to decide whether or not he takes off or not?</text>

            <text syncTime="279.805" offset="1222614">No, that may not be at his option.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.497" offset="1229406">The employer may be required if he doesn't want the fellow employee to do it during union hours or during working hours to say, “Okay, do it after working hours.”</text>
            <text syncTime="290.757" offset="1266395">But it is not a privilege in the employer to refuse to meet or to compel a meeting with an employee without assistance of the union -- without the assistance of a fellow employee if that is requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.442" offset="1337135">I think the facts if they are stated should focus this issue rather sharply.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.384" offset="1372871">On the employer side, we have three people; a Lawrence Gerlach who was the president of the company, his wife Kathryn Gerlach who was the production manager, their son Lawrence Gerlach who's the general manager -- junior, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.450" offset="1449148">There's a certified bargaining representative, certified to represent the production employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.977" offset="1475271">On the union side with respect to day to day problems which arise there is a shop chairlady called Delila Mulford, there is an assistant shop chairlady called Martha Cochran, they were elected to their posts.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.153" offset="1535979">And then there is a long time employee a Catherine King about whom these events center.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.309" offset="1564609">On Friday October 10, 1969, the three Gerlachs, the shop chairlady, Catherine King and two other employees meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.451" offset="1605151">The employees are complaining about the wage rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.649" offset="1618004">They say they can't make a decent wage under the piecework system in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.789" offset="1638484">The meeting ends on an acrimonious exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.992" offset="1651336">The Gerlach say “If you don't like it here, go elsewhere.”</text>
            <text syncTime="391.544" offset="1669517">That later that same afternoon, Catherine King shuts down her machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.181" offset="1688116">She starts gesturing with her hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.144" offset="1695953">She causes a minor disturbance.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.222" offset="1708283">Mrs. Gerlach tells hers resume production.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.722" offset="1722284">Catherine King tells her, “Mind your own business.”</text>
            <text syncTime="407.791" offset="1734510">At that point, Mrs. Gerlach says to King, “Go down and see the president Mr. Gerlach.”</text>
            <text syncTime="416.076" offset="1767633">She goes but on the way she asks the shop chairlady to accompany her to assist her at this meeting with the president.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.383" offset="1808906">When they get there, the Gerlachs object to the presence of the shop chairlady and she responds, “Catherine paid her dues and she's entitled to have me be there.”</text>
            <text syncTime="440.400" offset="1865017">Since Catherine refused to submit to the interview without the presence of the shop chairlady and since the Gerlachs refused to have her there, they were both sent back to their work stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.675" offset="1910053">The first blow fell on Sunday, October 12. Mulford is called on the telephone, she's told she is suspended for two days and the reason is that she attempted to represent Catherine King.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.689" offset="1986121">The next day, Monday October 13th, again, King is called to the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.315" offset="2012662">This time she asked the assistant shop chairlady, Martha Cochran.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.767" offset="2030425">Now, Martha Cochran to which accompany her.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.737" offset="2046307">Marta Cochran's presence is subjected too.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.170" offset="2060100">Cochran asks, “What do you want to speak to King about?”</text>
            <text syncTime="493.084" offset="2075669">She is told, “We want to take off where we left off on Friday” to which Cochran responds well, “I'm sorry, but if that's what you want to talk to her about that is union business and she has asked me to represent her.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.803" offset="2134601">I am a union steward and that's my duty.”</text>
            <text syncTime="513.187" offset="2156126">Again, Gerlach was refused permission to return to work because she refused to submit to a private interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.529" offset="2181517">Cochran's timecard was pulled from the rack.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.214" offset="2196250">The next day, Tuesday, October 14th, Cochran is now suspended for two days for seeking to represent King.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.419" offset="2229060">And King is not allowed to return to work because she refuses to submit to an interview without the presence of her union representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.344" offset="2260720">Wednesday, October 15th, Mulford's two days suspension is at an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.261" offset="2284440">The three of them go to the Gerlachs.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.022" offset="2295411">Cochran is told she can't return to work because she has got one more day suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.718" offset="2318294">King is told she can't return to work unless she submits to a private interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.835" offset="2338670">Mulford is allowed to return to work but she's admonished to mind her own business.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.247" offset="2360404">And she responds, “I was minding my own business.”</text>
            <text syncTime="568.035" offset="2375555">Catherine had a right to representation as well as anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.316" offset="2396662">And the events culminate on October 16th.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.782" offset="2410454">Cochran suspension is now at an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.578" offset="2421635">All three go to seek Gerlach.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.397" offset="2432920">Cochran gets her timecard.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.748" offset="2438353">She's allowed to return to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.867" offset="2450892">King is told submit to a private interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.479" offset="2473253">She asked with Delila Mulford, the shop chairlady.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.852" offset="2486732">She is told, “No, not with Delila.”</text>
            <text syncTime="598.777" offset="2498435">She is also told that, “If you walk out that door if you again refuse to submit a private interview, you're finished.”</text>
            <text syncTime="605.769" offset="2526438">She walked out the door, she was finished.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.080" offset="2539708">Mulford asks, “What about me?”</text>
            <text syncTime="612.256" offset="2552351">She is told, “You're finished too.”</text>
            <text syncTime="615.050" offset="2563532">That's two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.606" offset="2569801">Cochran has left but not for a very long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.730" offset="2586311">That day, she submits or tries to submit written grievances to Gerlach, Jr. The written grievances complaining of King's discharge, her suspension for two days, Cochran's -- Mulford suspension for two days, and her discharge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1338.842" offset="5458735">Turning to and this is on page 8 (a) of our petition -- the white.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.569" offset="5489664">Turning next to the company suspensions of Mulford and Cochran, the company claims that both employees were suspended for being away from their machines without permission.</text>

            <text syncTime="1362.899" offset="5554970">There is ample evidence in the record to support and we adopt this finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.716" offset="5574196">In particular, we note that Mrs. Gerlach testified that union chairlady had left the floor in the past on union business without being disciplined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.501" offset="5613380">It follows that to despair a treatment here was motivated by the company's desire to punish Mulford and Cochran for performing their duties as union chairladies in seeking to represent King at the conference that the company requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.912" offset="5691016">We have taken the position that at the heart of this case is Section 7 and that it is irrelevant to this case that there may be no cantonment Section 8 (a)(5) bargaining obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.224" offset="5748276">We think we can illustrate it by a case that this Court has already decided one called Washington Aluminum where a group of workers and protest against the lack of heat in the plant walked out as a body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.983" offset="5803342">They were discharged that discharge was held to the unfair labor practice because these employees were engaging in concerted activity for mutual aid or protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.641" offset="5845974">Yet those same employees did not and could not have the advantages of bargaining because they had no bargaining representative and precisely here as in that case, the concerted activity for mutual aid or protection existing, the employees were free or should be free of reprisal for that conduct whether or not the employer had an additional obligation to bargain with the union representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.646" offset="5949942">In this case, we think that union representation is surely at the essence of concerted activity for mutual aid or protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.662" offset="5994036">Employees joined unions for the precise purpose of pulling their strength and dealing with their employer on equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.555" offset="6029563">In this case, the employees pulled their strength.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.184" offset="6044087">They elected one of their number to represent them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.762" offset="6058402">When that person elected by the others to represent them seeks to provide the representation which the employee asks it is concerted activity for mutual aid or protection in the most simplistic sense of that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.833" offset="6126738">That view is also consonant with what the Section 7 is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.415" offset="6145024">It is all about eliminating individual helplessness in dealing with any employer and it is especially manifest in this kind of situation when an employee is asked to confront his employer in a situation where the risk of discipline exists that employee is in a precarious position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.346" offset="6236766">That employee may be in experienced, he may be ignorant, he may be frightened, he may not have -- be unable to express himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.528" offset="6273442">Those disadvantages are overcome by having a union representative at the interview so that he is not exposed to unmerited discipline because he is scared, is frightened, is inarticulate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1655.184" offset="6724106">On the other hand, the representative were not asked to present a grievance but it's attending to safeguard the collective bargaining cannot exclude the griever and withdraw his grievance or destroy it by not permitting its consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.663" offset="6781994">Now, the extent to which the proviso is cut into what would otherwise be the exclusive authority of the representative is an extraordinarily difficult and in my view still unresolved problem but we don't have it in this case because in this case we have consonants between what the employee wants.</text>

            <text syncTime="1906.531" offset="7729507">This case raises an interesting question before the Court to determine the scope of the right of an employee to representation and his dealings with management.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.259" offset="7796381">The facts of the case are simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.863" offset="7810800">The issue in the case I think everybody agrees on and the under penning legally of where the authority lies to order such a right by an employee is not in dispute since Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act as its been amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.192" offset="7892093">Now, a number of situations exist with respect to the possible scope of representation rights of an employee under Section 7 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.309" offset="7952593">There is nothing in the wording per se of this Section of the Act which really throws any direct light on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.421" offset="7989060">For example, there is nothing in Section 7 that says, “An employee shall have the right to a representative and that these situations or spells it out.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.828" offset="8034722">The Act simply says that an employee has the right to engage in collective activity concerted activities as the actual word of the statute for purposes of collective bargaining and other mutual aid and protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.409" offset="8105044">Well, the word concerted of course has a technical meaning that is being considered by a number of courts and it is generally been held to mean group activities for representation activities that the group as a whole was interested in.</text>

            <text syncTime="2031.804" offset="8230640">The question here is whether or not the word “concerted” embraces one employee such as we have in each aspect of this case or in many the cases that have been held whether that concerted applies to them with respect to their own individual rights with respect to an employer at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.027" offset="8319457">For example, in a disciplinary situation involving one employee does that involve a concerted or group activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.989" offset="8359372">Now, there it is clear that where a group activity is involved then the employee have a right to representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.076" offset="8407646">But it does not say as I read the Act here that an employee has the right to a representative to handle his own personal individual problems which may arise on a one to one relationship between himself for his employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2161.453" offset="8749223">Now, it's interesting I think when you look back over the history of this situation that no court and certainly not the Labor Relations Board has ever said that on the basis of that language, an employee has the right to a representative with him at all times and at all places under all circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.925" offset="8847026">In other words, no one has ever contended that that language there gives a broad across the board right to an employee to have a friend with him or to have a union representative with him under any circumstances when management plucks to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.429" offset="8917138">Down through the history, up until quality came alone over a period of almost 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.334" offset="8944724">The rights in this regard were exceedingly limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.750" offset="8966353">A dichotomy had developed by virtue of Board decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.876" offset="8990908">A division of this whole, if you please which would the whole being of the right of an employee to have a representative with him at any time under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.595" offset="9033749">No one said that was the status of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.206" offset="9044198">No one interpreted Section 7 that way, but they carved off one piece of that whole and said, that where there is an interview being taking place between employer and employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.274" offset="9108459">In that situation, and where it is not an investigatory a fact-finding talk of interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.985" offset="9139284">In other words, an interview first amend contracted further to a particular kind of interview one that was not investigatory or fact finding but one which had to do with the imposing of discipline -- a decision by an employer to an employee passing judgment upon his case of a problem and that very limited area and those circumstances, an employee had a right to have a representative present to him in those particular times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.036" offset="9279509">Now, whether this is a dichotomy that is based upon any real rational reason or not, is something that's debatable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.698" offset="9318170">But nevertheless, that is the way the law developed for some 25 years up until quality came along.</text>
