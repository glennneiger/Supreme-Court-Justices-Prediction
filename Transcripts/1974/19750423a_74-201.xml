            <text syncTime="189.473" offset="861288">The reply brief filed by the appellant, City of Richmond has a chronology of all the events in this complex litigation beginning on page 12, which is quite helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.746" offset="934327">Basically, there were studies that began in the 1950 showing a need in the view of many for annexation because of changes in the composition of the city exodus of young affluent persons, the many references that the city was becoming a place of the poor and the old and the black.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.217" offset="1056266">And throughout the course of proceedings, there was a need for land that could be developed and there was a problem about the tax-based of the city.</text>

            <text syncTime="265.237" offset="1164309">The one against Henrico proceeded first and resulted in an ward by the annexation Court which the city found unacceptable, indications are because of the heavy payment that would have to be made and --</text>

            <text syncTime="290.684" offset="1266082">The merger was the former method and while the city voters voted for it, the county voters did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.433" offset="1297115">So the annexation suits were then brought and when the Henrico suit culminated in an unacceptable ward, the city proceeded with the Chesterfield suit, which was then compromised and we what we have before as a result of the compromise.</text>

            <text syncTime="855.888" offset="3526928">In that case, and I have the opinion here of the Attorney General in rejecting the annexation in a very similar situation, where there was an at large council system, wrote a letter, spelling out in detail of the Government's position, and that letter is reproduced in the District Court's opinion, and we explain that one way to meet the problem of dilution on the council, and I am quoting from the letter "would be to adapt a fairly drawn system of single member wards."</text>

            <text syncTime="914.545" offset="3761507">Now, in response to this, the intervenors in Petersburg argued that even if this change were made with respect to the city council, the district Court should not approve the plan in Petersburg, the annexation for the reason that the election of the sixth constitutional officers provided for in the Virginia Constitution would not be affected and that a lute of effect on the black vote would occur in the election for the City Treasurer, the Sheriff, the Commissioner of Revenue, etcetera.</text>

            <text syncTime="962.226" offset="3952306">In response to that argument as we read the opinion in Petersburg, the District Court said, the Court concludes and I'm reading from the opinion in accordance with the Attorney General's findings that this annexation can be approved only on the condition that modifications calculated to neutralize to the extent possible any adverse effect upon the political participation of black voters are adopted that is that the plaintiff shift from an at large to a ward system of electing its city councilmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.909" offset="4111026">In coming to this conclusion with respect to the argument of the intervenors as to the constitutional officers, we take note of several factors and the Court spelled out its reasons for not construing the Act to black annexations in effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1659.151" offset="6739989">We ask that this Court approve as its judgment the consent judgment that was worked by the Attorney General in the City of Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.967" offset="6803205">It is set forth in the record, it contains not only the ward plan but the machinery for almost immediate election as the City of Richmond feels as sooner we get back to ballot box control, the better everyone is in their city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.845" offset="6894738">Now, first of all let me say with respect to a question that was asked about since 1948 in black participation in the city council.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.016" offset="6951476">Mr. Mattox has shown me a piece of paper, which is really set forth in the record pages 112 to 132 which shows this: "Since 1948 under the election at large system, the citizens of Richmond have elected five -- have elected four, yes it is, to the council and one has been appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.297" offset="7048547">At one time, there were as many as three black citizens on the city council."</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="1742.208" offset="7072162">On the nine-member council.</text>

            <text syncTime="1743.448" offset="7077177">On the nine-member.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.871" offset="7082820">So, I believe the record with respect to Richmond while we talk a lot about black voting and polarization and everything, these blacks could not be elected without white votes because as Mr. Wallace has pointed out, they have never constituted more than 44% of the voting population and the record also shows of course that the whites are generally much larger in their percentage of voting than the black citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.756" offset="7214373">So, the City of Richmond, number one, because this matter has been here four times already and this is the fourth time would like to get back to handling its own affairs and get out of Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.822" offset="7270693">Now, with reference to this particular nine-ward plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.545" offset="7293576">What happened as the record shows is that after Petersburg at large election must be replaced by a ward plan in order to eliminate the discriminatory effect there, the City of Richmond and conceded on the record below that principle govern Richmond and began working very intensively to try to come up with a plan that would satisfy that standard that would not abridge or deny the right to vote on account of race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.947" offset="7455117">And so back and forth, back and forth plans went with the Department of Justice trying to achieve a plan that would meet with their approval as having eliminated all possible discriminatory effect of the annexation and finally that was achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.666" offset="7538082">And I must tell you Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I thought that when that was achieved the case was over because it seems to me that under the statute it says you can either go to the Attorney General and if he interposes no objection, if he approves in other words or you can go to a three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.757" offset="7602448">Now, the city was in the three-judge court and the Department of Justice took the position but since they were there that the matter should be presented to the three judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.861" offset="7642781">The special voting rights court, but that it should be presented as a consent judgment, well, because it would also have this election machinery and it too that was one other part of their presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.186" offset="7696071">Well, I presented that to the city and they agreed to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.776" offset="7710490">Their great desire is to get on with elections in Richmond and get this all behind them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.288" offset="7736508">Now, the plan as presented, the nine-ward plan really allows the black citizen of Richmond fair representation in the overall of the political processes of the city prior to the annexation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.801" offset="7818533">They couldn't elect anyone under this plan assuming black voting polarization which I don't like to assume.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.797" offset="7850611">This is kind of repugnant to a lot of ideals and a lot of people but they -- assuming that the blacks are assured of four seats on the city council.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.741" offset="7902333">Now, as Mr. Holt says in his brief on page 16 four seats on the council is really fiscal control of the city because you can't adopt a budget without six votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.606" offset="7949772">So, I think that this is an enormously meaningful fair solution to this whole problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.381" offset="7992926">The case when it came on below as we say in our reply brief, we quote the order, the three judges said that the issue was the annexation in Richmond as amended by this ward plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.928" offset="8063039">And then they -- after there was some discussion about offering evidence on the original annexation, the master went back to the three judges and they said well you can let in evidence on the original annexation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.181" offset="8128136">But to me completely throughout these whole proceedings, I thought when the Attorney General who has made a statutory expert under this Act and nearly all of this plans are passed on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.764" offset="8194382">They don't go to Court that when he put his staff of approval on this the case really should have been over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.082" offset="8219669">Now, time and time again this Court has said that you give special deference to the views of someone who is charged with the administration of a statute and we put all of those in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.845" offset="8278706">And so here, I earnestly believe that the Attorney General's views below were entitled to more weight and more deference than they were given.</text>

            <text syncTime="2400.858" offset="9706768">I represent the Crusade for Voters of Richmond, one of the intervenors here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.580" offset="9733726">We believe this is the type of case that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act was designed to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.076" offset="9763715">On the surface, we have a normal annexation purported to be for legitimate ends to help a city through some of the problems that a number of cities go through in this day and age.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.596" offset="9821706">On the surface then it is like nearly a thousand other annexations that have gone through under the Voting Rights Act with no problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.149" offset="9855979">In fact though, this annexation was and remains a deliberate effort on the part of the city to negate the gains made by black voters under the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.751" offset="9914389">When Congress enacted Section 5, added Section 5 to the Voting Rights Act in 1965, it did so because as the testimony in the legislative history shows Congress well knew that the history of voting discrimination had been the inventive development of new stratagems to cope with -- to make certain that white political control was maintained and that discrimination against black voters was maintained after the existing stratagems were struck down, so that Section 5 was in effect a counterpart of Section 4 which mandated the elimination of test and devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.989" offset="10071333">And in fact in Richmond, what we have is a situation where the growth of black voting strength, the overcoming by black voters of the history of discrimination against them which occurred as the 60's grew on and especially with the passage of the Voting Rights Act was suddenly aborted in 1970, 1969 actually took effect in 1970.</text>

            <text syncTime="2631.593" offset="10629726">But I think that the city in order to disprove bad purpose or to show that the bad purpose has been dispelled must do something more than show some minimization or some degree of amelioration of a bad effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.913" offset="10679045">I think that the Government seems to agree with the crusade and with the Court that there have to be some independent proof that the bad purpose has been dispelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.509" offset="10721364">One of the items of that proof would be a showing that the annexation has or had a what the Court an objectively verifiable legitimate purpose and I think to my mind, this is the same standard was referred to by Mr. Justice White in his opinion in the Palmer case when he used the phrase "colorable nondiscriminatory reason."</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.823" offset="10810702">I think the Government has highlighted the problem of the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.288" offset="10836511">I simply disagree with the inferences it draws from the state of the evidence below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.352" offset="10860753">The Government in effect says, we think the evidence below wasn't clear, we think there ought to be a new hearing in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.329" offset="10892727">What that means to me is that the city didn't meet its burden, not only did it meet its burden but cannot now show what it would have to show to gain a reversal in that ground that is at the findings of the special master and the District Court on purpose were clearly erroneous that the city can't meet that standard that it didn't meet its burden of proof in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.103" offset="10987813">Therefore, to me what the Government is saying is that although the city has failed to meet its burden of proving sound purpose below, it should be entitled because we, the Government or the United States think that that evidence might be available to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.363" offset="11064822">Well, that suggestion of a new trial, I suppose is a matter of equity and a matter of procedure to be determined by the district court below in the first instance to be determined perhaps by this Court on review but I don't think there should be any confusion about what it amounts to and it seems to me that it amounts clearly to a recognition of the fact that the record below shows that there isn't any evidence or isn't enough evidence for the city to meet its burden of showing an objectively verifiable legitimate purpose and therefore or that being one of the elements of showing that the bad purpose has been dispelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.441" offset="11225109">But I think as a starting point, what the Government says amounts to a recognition the city failed to meet its burden.</text>

            <text syncTime="2857.772" offset="11534503">Well my recollection -- I understand that, Your Honor, Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.055" offset="11547564">My recollection is that the city prepared the plan and prepared a cover consent judgment which had circulated at the Attorney General or his representative signed -- that the representative -- two intervenors did not sign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.606" offset="11613811">That the city then submitted the matter -- submitted that judgment as a proposed consent judgment to the District Court and that the two intervenors filed brief memoranda saying that they didn't agree and thought it should be accepted since it did not have the consent of all parties in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.428" offset="11681102">As far as I know that was the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.334" offset="11688730">There was no legal argument nor any memoranda, nor any further effort by the city to argue that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.823" offset="11718614">I would say this on that subject that I think the structure of Section 5 was initially, exclusively or initially created an exclusive remedy for the city in the District Court by declaratory judgment that during the hearings in the Senate, as I recall, Attorney General Katzenbach was asked, “Wouldn't this be a great burden for a number changes that would be quite minor?" and he acknowledged that it probably would be and it was after that -- while the hearings were going on that the Government came back or the legislative draftsman of the justice department came back with the proviso which is now in Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.995" offset="11887365">It was initially understood I believe that the proviso would be a limited remedy and that the declaratory judgment would be a predominant one as it has happened mechanically, it is going the other way around.</text>

            <text syncTime="3408.183" offset="13736103">Let me direct myself in the time remaining to the question of effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.445" offset="13749164">I think unquestionably the addition of these 45,000 white people in the context of the population figures that were existing in Richmond had and has a diluting effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.546" offset="13809560">The question is how that diluting effect is to be overcome and I think what the Petersburg case said and the way the District Court here read the Petersburg case is that at least where you have no discriminatory purpose, you can -- you can meet your burden as to effect by making a good faith showing that you have minimized the dilutive effect to the extent possible, or to the extent reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.181" offset="13924080">It is something I suppose of reasonable man standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.482" offset="13937351">I think the District Court here was suggesting and I think there are two things that are different about this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.284" offset="13964518">First, I think as the District Court suggested in footnote 46 of its opinion here, there may well be a different standard as to how far one must go in ameliorating effect where there has been and is a discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.536" offset="14029511">In other words, it may be that the phrase eliminate dilution is appropriate in a discriminatory purpose case whereas the phrase minimize dilution would be sufficient in a none in a case that lack of discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.168" offset="14088025">And on this, I think we derive some support from the majority opinion in the case of Wright versus City of Emporia in which there was a discussion of the ways in which a bad purpose or discriminatory purpose can infect the effect either by heightening the feelings of stigma or by casting some glow or gloss on the evaluation of the claimed legitimate purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.656" offset="14214040">That is one thing but --</text>

            <text syncTime="3546.023" offset="14287496">I don't think that's dilution because I think in that large election the sub position that you might get all nine or virtually all nine of the councilmen is in a sense of bonus that flows from the mechanism and to come back from that to.</text>

            <text syncTime="3584.490" offset="14441305">One that I mentioned is the idea that elimination rather than minimization maybe required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.460" offset="14461262">A second point I would make though is that in this case I don't believe the city has met its burden of proving that its nine-member plan did meet the effect test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.636" offset="14509955">I would mention since my time has expired just briefly that the city refused and I think the record will show this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.541" offset="14541511">The city refused to consider any other plans once it had its plan drawn and the department's agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.616" offset="14569827">They refused to look at any other plans although I think it was not only arguably but definitely under an obligation given the background of circumstances to find the best plan available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.396" offset="14612982">And I don't think that the crusades plans were not offered or are not offered as plans that are in fact necessarily better or constitutional or mandatory or anything like that, they simply offered to show that even under the city's pattern better alternatives were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.344" offset="14692707">It might be that the proper plan would not be won that had four black, four white in a ninth district somewhere in the middle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.347" offset="14720711">Well, it might be that the better plan, the best plan would be one that had essentially no uni-racial districts or one or two if that is the best you can draw given neighborhoods with other districts being in a sense up for grabs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.709" offset="14782255">We simply sought to show that even under the cities pattern that a better plan can be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.392" offset="14800959">We don't believe that black voting is an inevitable necessity, the pattern has shown that we are in the most recent elections there has been some departure from that because the crusade did support two whites as well as several black candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.993" offset="14871385">And I might point out that in judging the question of enhancement had this annexation not taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.954" offset="14903150">The results of the 1970 elections the most recent elections would show if we took out the votes cast in the annex area that crusade black candidates would have had four candidate -- would have had four seats, two whites who were elected, one black was elected and a fourth or a second black or fourth person who was elected in the old city but who was not elected because he didn't finish high enough in the annex area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.533" offset="15009520">I think by a variety of tests city didn't need its effect test, it didn't meet its purpose test and I would like to advert just very for 30 seconds to the Government's suggestion of election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.461" offset="15049226">We too believe that our election would be highly appropriate that it has been five years before since an election has taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.295" offset="15076603">But what the Government would have us do is to have the plan which the city was not able to show satisfy the Voting Rights Act have that put in to effect have what amounts to a back door or side door disposition of what it could not obtain through the front door.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.573" offset="15165628">And since the upcoming decisions will be -- will involve many that affect the future course of the City of Richmond and this annexation, I think that it is not proper to have an election of that sort if we are to have an election and there are many good reasons for having one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.854" offset="15230830">I think that at least for temporary purposes it will be appropriate to have an election in the old city conducted under the old system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.444" offset="15265102">And I realize that raises a significant Fourteenth Amendment problems but I think we are in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.436" offset="15293106">We're in a very peculiar situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.921" offset="15299062">I think peculiar remedies may be called for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.303" offset="15312541">This case does not involve -- the decision of the District Court does not mean that annexations of legitimate sort by cities legitimately and honestly seeking to meet their problems are in anyway hampered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.960" offset="15367189">What this case involves is simply the appropriate action or the appropriate impact of the Voting Rights Act of the Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act on those changes, which like this one, it was designed to deal with.</text>

            <text syncTime="4074.382" offset="16400906">Yes sir, I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4077.818" offset="16414595">In my brief, I made a remark that four seats on city council guarantee physical control, I wish to point to the Court that I'm in error that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4085.027" offset="16443434">Five seats can pass the general approved budget, it requires six votes for any special appropriations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4092.294" offset="16472586">So, five seats on the council in the City of Richmond is physical control of the city as well as administrative control.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.582" offset="16505710">I disagree with the Solicitor General on the statement of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.560" offset="16529638">This case goes back to 1950s and it goes back specifically to 1960, at which time, the city of Richmond attempted to enter into a merger within the Henrico County.</text>
            <text syncTime="4116.100" offset="16567777">The record shows and the evidence is that the city limited all of its comments to the officials of Henrico County to the question that the city was having a fast increasing black population and they needed more white people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4129.145" offset="16619917">It is instructive to note that when the merger vote was held, 100% of all black voter pressings in the City of Richmond voted no to merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4138.639" offset="16657951">68% of all mixed precincts voted no to merger and the crusade for voters wrote a letter specifying to the governor and to the press that merger was a dilution and an attempted to dilution of their vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.265" offset="16712391">Following that time, the city filed two annexations, one against Henrico and one against Chesterfield and let the Chesterfield annexation sit on the back burner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.149" offset="16743946">They received a ward from the Henrico annexation Court of 16 square miles for $55 million and approximately 45,000 people, white people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4170.219" offset="16784280">They turned down that ward, not as they suggest because it costs too much money but because they found that the city charter wouldn't allow them to float bonds to pay for annexation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4179.979" offset="16823254">In 1968, they changed that law in preparation for the upcoming trial in the Chesterfield case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.719" offset="16850213">In 1965, following their rejection of the Henrico ward, secret meetings began between the city, the white officials of the City of Richmond specifically excluding any black representatives and continued up until the time of the compromised with members of Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors and their county manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="4204.021" offset="16919489">The entire discussion from the very beginning was we need white people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4209.998" offset="16943313">They discussed politics, the poll tax is off.</text>
            <text syncTime="4213.669" offset="16958046">The blacks are increasing in their political participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.173" offset="16972048">They commissioned two political discussions and analysis of the 1966 and 1968 elections which predicted that the blacks would receive at least four possibly five seats in the 1970 election.</text>
            <text syncTime="4230.438" offset="17025128">Also during this time, they tried an end run with the general legislature of Virginia, something called the Old Heiser Commission which sought to allow the general assembly to change the boundaries and the vice chairman went on the stand which is evidence in this case and said, "Our sole purpose was to keep the blacks from taking over the city of Richmond."</text>
            <text syncTime="4249.129" offset="17099839">To quote the mayor who headed up the negotiations as long as I am the mayor of the City of Richmond, “The niggers won't take over this town.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4256.976" offset="17131290">To quote the mayor again in speaking to another councilman at a meeting in Virginia Beach,“I did what I did in reference to the compromise because the niggers are not qualified to run the City of Richmond.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4267.734" offset="17174340">And that is the entire focus of the City if Richmond from 1960 and it continues up until today to quote the present mayor of the City of Richmond, “Once we get award plan which he characterizes reconstructive and Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act expires, we'll hold an at large referendum and get rid of that ward plan."</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.085" offset="17275695">The city has resisted the award plan single member districts from the very beginning up to an including the time in which it filed a suit in the three-judge district court in the District of Columbia and maintain the posture that the original annexation was perfectly all right and at large the expanded elections were perfectly fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4310.324" offset="17344658">It was not until after Petersburg that they even sought or acquiesced an award plan and then went to the acquiescent a ward plan which the district court below found in and of itself had a purpose to maintain white supremacy in the City of Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="4328.346" offset="17416756">Now, we have proposed as a relief in this case that the proper remedy is deannexation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4339.608" offset="17461791">I have proposed this in the District Court of Columbia I proposed in what's known as Holt two which had still stayed since December of 1971 where we sought an injunction because the Voting Rights Act have not been complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="4353.966" offset="17519261">That maintained in Holt one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.677" offset="17526053">The problem with that position is that we have a basic assumption that an award of the deannexation in this case would result in the end of annexation for cities and that simply isn't the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4368.472" offset="17577253">An award of deannexation in this particular case would uphold a dignity of the Voting Rights Act in 1965 would serve notice that you can't go out to “keep the niggers form taking over a municipal government and serve that purpose well.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4387.815" offset="17654680">It would not prevent cities from expanding as Judge Butzner of the Fourth Circuit so cogently noted divestiture, his a word for deannexation, would not mean that cities can't annex even where annexation would change the racial percentages of the population.</text>

            <text syncTime="4478.592" offset="18017782">I would not like the change of an at large system in the context of your first questions I believe earlier today that where black citizens have played the democratic process, have given adherence to the whole concept of work within the democratic system and have worked hard to gain their political position to have that rug jerked out at he last minute just when they were within grasp of political control, I think would violate all the standards of fair play in the democratic process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4511.088" offset="18147767">But in answer to your question, in a pure abstract going from an at large to a single member is not per se dilutive but you have to look at dilution in the context within which the change occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4524.112" offset="18199803">Now, in the case of the City of Richmond going from a ward plan, I mean from an at large to a ward on the heels of what has to be the most classic case of out and out purposeful disenfranchisement in that context, I believe that award system does not cure nor even approach the question of purpose or the question of effect especially the ward plan prepared by the city of Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="4549.327" offset="18300635">The Court in dealing with that question of the burden of the city, it is characterized by Mr. Rhyne of the city that that's an extra burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="4559.239" offset="18340342">Actually, I think what the Court is doing is relaxing the literal interpretation of the Act which says you've got two burdens, you got to prove no purpose, and you got to prove no effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4569.414" offset="18380988">What the city, I mean, what the Court is actually doing in that case is saying there is an exception to that rule, there is an exception to a literal interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4578.954" offset="18419231">And I think the reasoning goes like this, that if you have a verifiably objective legitimate annexation, it serves all the races of that community.</text>
            <text syncTime="4589.551" offset="18461550">It serves all the overwriting governmental needs and purposes, and if it is objectively verifiable then and only then do you come back to a Petersburg approach and seek to eliminate as much as possible any of the dilutive effect because if you can eliminate the effect there is no need to send it back because you're harming the entire governmental structure in so doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="4816.570" offset="19369671">The objectively verifiable legitimacy of this annexation, all the governments and the Government and the city's arguments deal with, well this is a consequential incidental result of a legitimate annexation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4828.686" offset="19418154">The evidence is replete, I do not agree with the Solicitor General from the very first day of Holt I which is swallowed up in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4839.378" offset="19460890">The entire thrust of the Holt intervenors has been that one of the most glaring examples of why this annexation is a bad annexation is that it serves absolutely no governmental purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4855.236" offset="19524315">The Government and the city say the courts recognize that annexations are inevitable I will assent to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4861.714" offset="19550229">But not this annexation was inevitable to approve by remand or otherwise this annexation with a lock to the City of Richmond into the worst possible annexation they could ever have, economically, administratively, racially, and would serve notice that there is a way to avoid the prescriptions.</text>

            <text syncTime="4924.899" offset="19802990">That they knowing the local nuances of such an order that the mechanics of a deannexation order would be the proper one to carry it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4933.942" offset="19839143">In other words, if we deny the declaration then the coverage question comes into focus.</text>

            <text syncTime="4942.041" offset="19871535">Therefore it must be in joined and that Court could then have the machinery rather than the District Court of Columbia to carry it through.</text>
            <text syncTime="4948.151" offset="19895986">I'd also suggested that the state court still enforced the annexation court by agreement of the parties, the city and the county which also could be used as an arbitrary for any problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="5071.690" offset="20390118">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5074.062" offset="20399626">There is an error on page 57 of our brief that I would like to correct first of all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5081.767" offset="20430451">We refer there in the last paragraph to the median family income of $12,400.00 in the annex area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5091.468" offset="20469217">The $7,692.00 median income in the remaining part of the city and then on down four lines from the bottom, we say those median family income $20,000.00 it should be under $4,000.00 which is the poverty level.</text>
            <text syncTime="5114.398" offset="20560959">Now, I would also because my distinguished colleague Mr. Wallace has called my attention to it several times to point out that the government does not take the position here that there isn't evident and overwhelming evidence to support the fact that city does have an objectively verifiable legitimate reason for retaining the next area and they say that in their brief on pages 30 to 35 so that they agreed that the evidence is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5154.084" offset="20719679">The only reason they made reference to the possible remand was just to lean over backwards in case someone might come up with something else but they feel that the best solution of this is to get on with the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="5171.113" offset="20787806">Now, on purpose, I think we ought to be fair about it.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="5175.245" offset="20804315">Get on with the election everybody say that you agree about that but in his way but Mr. Venable just -- so this one, he was talking about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5183.494" offset="20837334">He was talking about getting onward on election and confining the electorate to the old city.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.964" offset="20859277">Now, what sort of getting on with what kind of election are you talking about?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_s_rhyne" startTime="5192.026" stopTime="5334.429">
            <label>Mr. Charles S. Rhyne</label>
            <text syncTime="5192.026" offset="20871502">An election under the nine ward plan which we feel is the only fair election where the black citizen of Richmond will have full representation and participation in the political process because they are there guaranteed four seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="5207.205" offset="20932211">Now, with reference to the deannexation, Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Venable, I would call attention to the fact that the crusade in their representations to the three-judge court below and we've quoted this on pages two and three of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5224.825" offset="21002637">Opposed deannexation said that this would be -- leave the city an empty shell, a worn out shell and it wouldn't have the room or financial resources to provide a good life worth citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="5238.298" offset="21056554">It would also instantly transform the schools from a black majority system to a virtual black system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5248.700" offset="21098141">So, I would say very earnestly that deannexation other than Mr. Venable everybody agrees is a bad remedy and we sincerely urge that on purpose that Mayor Bagley (ph) was the only one who's quoted throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="5265.060" offset="21163656">Mayor Bagley (ph) has been off the city council and not as mayor since 1970 and he had nothing to do with this ward plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5271.277" offset="21188524">There are only two people left on the council who were on there at the time of this bad purpose settlement and that these people have worked awful hard to bring this about.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.920" offset="21235022">They're not bigots or racist in Richmond, Virginia, I think this is shown to the fact that the white people have elected so many blacks to the council and they have an enormous number of blacks who take part in their city government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.048" offset="21283610">I think there are how many departments are headed by blacks, seminary, seven.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.652" offset="21309942">This is not that kind of a city and so I think that if you're going to talk about purpose, let's be fair about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5308.999" offset="21339408">One man's terrible words in a bathroom down at Williamsburg shouldn't smear the good people of an entire city.</text>
            <text syncTime="5318.267" offset="21376397">And who's going to pay the penalty for the bad purpose, it shouldn't really come down that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5323.773" offset="21398444">The Government is obviously satisfied that there is no bad purpose here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5327.653" offset="21414013">They never would have signed this -- agreed to this ward plan and this solution.</text>

            <text syncTime="5334.429" offset="21441076">Well, don't you have to persuade us that the District Court is finding against during that point is clearly erroneous?</text>

            <text syncTime="5340.325" offset="21464691">And we urge that it is Your Honor that evidence is overwhelmingly against that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5345.369" offset="21484857">The mere fact that the Attorney General agreed to it at some evidence and the other evidence on the ward plan is such as only this so called expert burden and the economic thing where they say we didn't satisfy, they never have told us this what their extra burden was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5360.428" offset="21545044">So, we met our burden overwhelmingly when we -- with the Attorney General presented this nine ward plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5368.204" offset="21576182">So, I -- and I think that all the evidence there was in support of this plan and proved that the city nail in connection with this plan doesn't have a bad purpose and certainly the ward plan doesn't have a bad effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5385.211" offset="21644204">It gives everybody a fair participation in the Government of the City of Richmond and so again, we urge that this Court find that the consent judgment is the best possible solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.572" offset="21709615">Not a perfect, there's no perfect solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5403.658" offset="21717974">But it's the best possible solution and let the people of Richmond get on with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5407.437" offset="21733125">They've been litigating and litigating and litigating this reference to the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5411.571" offset="21749635">Well, that's been all the way up here and the Fourth Circuit held no Fifteenth Amendment rights were violated by this annexation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5418.640" offset="21777951">We just go over and over and over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="5420.703" offset="21786206">So we urge you to end it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5422.139" offset="21791953">It can be ended, they can have an election within 60 days and Richmond can govern its own affairs and get out of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5427.668" offset="21814000">That's what we urge to this Court to do.</text>
