            <text syncTime="73.121" offset="395891">This case is here in a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.097" offset="419715">The issue as we see it is whether a trial judge has discretion during the trial of the criminal case to order a defendant to produce relevant portions of a defense investigator's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.336" offset="472691">And specifically, we are referring to the time after the defendant has offered that investigator as a witness in his own behalf and after the direct testimony of that investigator who was called fro the specific purpose of impeaching government witnesses who already have testified.</text>

            <text syncTime="122.801" offset="594526">He had a copy of that report more than likely although the record is not clear on this defense counsel clearly had a copy of the report at the time of trial but it is a report that was prepared by the investigator and it's his report.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.935" offset="647084">So, it really is an order to the defense counsel or the defense witness to turnover that report.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul L. Freidman</label>
            <text syncTime="169.729" offset="782294">Judging from the transcript in this case, I sincerely doubt that. Our position basically is that cases like Jencks, and Gordon, and Goldman of this Court really support the view that a trial judge has that kind of a discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.130" offset="851884">In the absence any countervailing legislation or rule and we say that there is none.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="192.457" offset="873200">Is this sort of a reverse Jencks case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_l_freidman" startTime="194.902" stopTime="327.805">
            <label>Mr. Paul L. Freidman</label>
            <text syncTime="194.902" offset="883022">It is sort of a reverse Jencks case, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.592" offset="893785">And if you look back at Jencks, I think that anyone would have to agree that Jencks -- the Jencks case are began on a premise that judges have this kind of discretion and that the only purpose of Congress in passing the Jencks Act was to limit that discretion which existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.412" offset="972988">It addressed itself only to the problem of requiring the Government to turnover certain things to the defense because it was concern with fishing expeditions, national security things, that sort of interest to the Government but do not address the problem of this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.656" offset="1025964">Congress could address it but it hasn't and we submit that the Court hasn't addressed it in Rule 16 either because Rule 16 is a pretrial rule and it does not really govern once the trial begins.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.946" offset="1079150">The facts of this case very briefly indicate why it was necessary here or appropriate here for a judge to exercise his discretion, respondent on three others who are charged with federal bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.083" offset="1127737">Three of the robbers were captured on film during the bank robbery, one who was later identified as respondent in the trial was standing under the surveillance camera and he was the only one not captured on the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.076" offset="1175698">The Government's evidence against him came from two eyewitnesses; a bank teller and a salesman visiting the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.950" offset="1203179">It was those two eyewitnesses that the defense tried to impeach through the investigator.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.969" offset="1231287">First, they cross-examined the eyewitnesses asking one whether or not he had told the investigator that he'd only seen the back of the robber under the camera.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.939" offset="1267127">The witness denied having said.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.075" offset="1275695">The second witness was asked whether or not he had told the investigator that to him all blacks look-alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.104" offset="1299832">The witness denied having said it.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.286" offset="1312475">And at that point, the prosecutor requested that he'd be able to see the relevant portions of the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.623" offset="1333896">Respondent's counsel denied refuse to produce them.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.121" offset="1347897">The Court indicated it's inclination to order them produced but waited for further oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.950" offset="1371199">And then later said that he would order them produced but only after the investigator testified and only the relevant portions of the report and they offer their services and camera to review the report and excise extraneous matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="3474.010" offset="13999417">Your Honor, our contention is that the common law rules of evidence of which the rule refreshing recollection is one are complimentary to Rule 16 if there's a rule of the common law evidence specifically making an exception to Rule 16 then it should be followed, but here there is no specific rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.371" offset="14084890">There is no rule of evidence which would either authorize -- which would authorize the Government to produce this under any circumstances -- would authorize the government to get hold of it under any circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="3513.765" offset="14158451">Just very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.565" offset="14173602">On the Queens case, the purpose of Rule 613 was to get rid of the Queens case and so that you don't have to show it to the witness you're cross-examining but Rule 613 applies equally to oral statements and the written statements so that whole argument we think is not the very sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.882" offset="14254895">Finally, I think the point that came through from Justice White's last question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.182" offset="14280077">We call it waiver in our brief, if there's a constitutional involved whether it's a Sixth Amendment one or a work product privilege of some sort, which we discussed at length then in our replied brief or the Fifth Amendment one which we took and discussed in our initial brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.434" offset="14341099">Refreshing recollection makes no difference and the kind of discretion we're talking about in the trial judge in this case makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.969" offset="14371297">If there is no constitutional right or whatever kinds of privileges may exist prior to calling that witness once the subject is opened up by defense counsel, himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.678" offset="14414033">The same principles of Brown versus United States raffle other cases of this Court may clear that they cannot open it up, only partway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.462" offset="14449246">There's got to be cross-examination, all we're asking for is a decision of this Court which provides trial judges with the kind of discretion they need.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="3596.695" offset="14490102">The pillars, have you -- you still insisting that it's quite all right to keep the witness off the stand entirely rather than letting him testify and then demanding that you get the statement and having the Court order them to produce it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul L. Freidman</label>
            <text syncTime="3611.478" offset="14549243">All I'm saying is that in a situation like this with the problem as flagged early enough and it can be discussed and there can be legal argument out, a judge does not have to let the witness testify and then strike the testimony if counsel refuses to turn it over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.109" offset="14615803">If counsel is an officer of the Court says that he had made the decision already that he's not going to turn it over if that happens, I don't think the judge has to permit the direct testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.625" offset="14653837">It doesn't come up very often just because of the normal course of things but it happened that way in this case and it doesn't make any difference in terms of our argument.</text>
