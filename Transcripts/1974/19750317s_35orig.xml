            <text syncTime="9.439" offset="37721">This is in the original action brought by the United States against 13 of the states with coast lines on the Atlantic Ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.272" offset="77009">The issue is the ownership of the seabed of the continental shelf lying outside the three mile limit within which the seabed has been granted to the states by the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.306" offset="121208">The complaint of the United States alleges federal title to these lands in question and there's a dispute about it in the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.205" offset="160810">The states answered denying the title of the United States and claiming title for themselves. We appointed Albert Maris as Special Master and referred the case to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.755" offset="222981">The Special Master then severed the -- or recommended that the case against Florida be severed and consolidated with other proceedings and we agreed with him in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.014" offset="271987">The Special Master then took extensive evidence and has now filed his report.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.945" offset="291736">The United States accepts the report in all respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.108" offset="308349">The states however have filed a brief and orally argued a rather extensive exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.492" offset="337920">The report of the Special Master recommends that the Court enter a judgment for the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.662" offset="362580">It's his view and has been his been view and it's his view that the case is completely controlled by United States against California decided in 1947 and by the two cases that followed it, United States against Louisiana and United States against Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.924" offset="435618">We have considered the report and the exceptions and we agree with the Special Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.052" offset="464144">We think that the case indeed is controlled by our three prior cases and that United States under those cases is entitled to judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.763" offset="519001">Although the states have made admirable efforts to persuade us that that those cases should be overruled, we declined to disturb them.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.230" offset="556826">Our reasons for our conclusions are given in an opinion on file with the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.897" offset="579500">And as I say, we have concluded the judgment to be on the United States and it is so ordered. Mr. Justice Douglas took no part in the decision or consideration of the case.</text>
