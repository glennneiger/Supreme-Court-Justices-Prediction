            <text syncTime="42.174" offset="272071">Mr Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.574" offset="285654">Excuse me for not getting up, that's something I do less well.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.707" offset="306239">We are here today on a case that is at least in our judgment, extremely important to all 50 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.346" offset="352737">We are here on a petition for writ of the certiorari granted by this Court last February.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.216" offset="392234">The matter all began in the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.626" offset="409893">The Ohio 109th General Assembly passed a bill, Amended Substitute Senate Bill Number 147 and it was signed by Governor Gilligan, and to be effective on the first day of the pay period which included January 1, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.128" offset="535907">The bill provided for a pay increase for all state employees of either 38 cents per hour or 10% whichever was more.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.251" offset="600377">It averaged out to be a pay increase of roughly 7.7% for all state employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.796" offset="654608">After the statute was passed, signed by the Governor, the State of Ohio asked the federal pay board for authority to pay the increase, the Ohio General Assembly have enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.016" offset="731408">The Pay Board heard the petition, granted the authority to make the increase effective March 10, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.230" offset="796296">So there was a period of roughly two and one-half months when the pay increase was not paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.072" offset="827643">The federal pay board decided that the amount that would be paid starting from March 10, 1972 through the remainder of the buying in would equal an amount that will be consistent with the federal Pay Board standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.929" offset="931088">Thereafter, we filed an action in mandamus in the Supreme Court of which we asked the Ohio Supreme Court to order direct the state officials to pay the increase that the Ohio General Assembly said they should pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.750" offset="1042369">The Ohio Supreme Court issued a mandate that we requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.250" offset="1064417">Immediately, the federal government sought and obtained a temporary restraining order from the Federal District Court in Ohio which was then continued by the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals here in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.615" offset="1149785">And when the matter came to the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals they ruled that the pay increase was beyond the scope of Ohio to get that the State of Ohio was enjoined from doing what the Supreme Court of Ohio had ordered the Governor and the order to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.925" offset="1263052">We then found our petition here under the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and we filed the motion of not as an academic matter but because we seriously, honestly contend that the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prevents the federal pay board and the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals from doing what did they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.134" offset="1415920">Now, after this Court granted the petition last February.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.449" offset="1445177">The United States has filed a motion asking that the writ now be ruled to have been improvidently granted to use the words of the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.036" offset="1519470">They argued that even though that since the decision of the TECA.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.259" offset="1564400">A situation has occurred in California in which a situation very similar to this occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.304" offset="1616541">When the California General Assembly has to pay increase for its employees and the California Governor went to the Pay Board as the Ohio Governor again, got authority which was only partially what the statute said.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.192" offset="1712149">The California employees went to the California Supreme Court in mandamus as the Ohio did.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.551" offset="1745586">The California Supreme Court granted the writ and again as the Ohio did.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.495" offset="1773380">Then the federal government filed a petition for an injunction in California, again as it did in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.168" offset="1820087">The injunction was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.463" offset="1829177">And thereafter an appeal was taken to the TECA and to the Government surprise or with (Inaudible) surprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.674" offset="1878079">The TECA reversed in the Cohen case and California saying that the reason they reversed is the injunction was applied for on May 14, 1974 which was two weeks after the Economic Stabilization Act had expired and we understand although it's not in the record that the Government has filed a petition for writ of the certiorari in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.816" offset="2038680">And it seems to us anomalous to say the least that the Government one on the one hand contend that our writ should be dismissed as being improvidently granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.327" offset="2096671">And on the other hand, contend of the case of almost exactly similar important should be admitted by this Court in Cohen versus California.</text>

            <text syncTime="568.560" offset="2377644">As I understand it here, under this decision I made, you tell me if I'm mistaken, your clients will get everything you're asking for, would they?</text>

            <text syncTime="577.597" offset="2413798">Well there is no question but that when the TECA acted in our case, they acted on expired so that the injunction that once they issued remains in the Cohen versus California.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.821" offset="2498644">TECA decided that the application for the injunction came two weeks after the active expired so that I think the answer is that Ohio was enjoined and California is not.</text>

            <text syncTime="716.583" offset="2969684">The federal governor would not be able to enjoin that mandate unless it would be interpreted that the order of the September 1973 from the TECA was broad enough to cover what the Supreme Court might do later.</text>

            <text syncTime="953.943" offset="3919182">The point we want to emphasize most, we think in oral argument, is that what the TECA seem to say was that Maryland versus Wirtz decided by this Court, answered the appeal we made at the TECA a year ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.272" offset="4028479">We contended certainly does not that Maryland against Wirtz decided that the amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act as applied to the state schools and state institutions for the mentally retarded, etcetera limited the states authority to act and that the FLSA amendment were constitutional but in both of majority and the minority or the majority dissent in Maryland against Wirtz.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.496" offset="4213321">There is a great deal of language indicating that if the United States Congress had in the FLSA, said that the minimum wage that the State of Ohio shall pay to all its employees shall be $2.20 per hour, that this would not have been permissible under the Tenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.655" offset="4321991">We maintain that you can agree the Tenth Amendment as having any meaning at all and say that the Congress of the United States may do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1167.657" offset="4774013">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.571" offset="4801703">The Economic Stabilization Act was brought into effect in August of 1970 and expired of its own terms on April 30, 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.453" offset="4857187">The Act under Section 203 authorized the president to issue orders and regulations to stabilize among other things, salaries and wages, at levels not less than those that were prevailing on May 25, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.568" offset="4933674">And pursuant to such orders and regulations, the Pay Board issued its own regulations which limited the annual wage or salary increase to 5.5% for all persons subject to the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.746" offset="5006399">On January 15, 1972, the Ohio General Assembly passed Senate Bill 147 known as the Pay Bill Act which provided for an average increase of 10.6% beginning January 1, 1972 for 65,000 of employees of the State of Ohio, the state universities and the county welfare departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.653" offset="5130010">Subsequent thereto, Ohio filed an application for the Pay Board for an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.560" offset="5161566">They asked that they be permitted to pay the 10.6% increase but the Pay Board permitted them only to pay 7% from January 1, 1972 to March 10, 1972 but thereafter the Pay Board approved the increase in its entirety of 10.6%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.626" offset="5249860">The Ohio Supreme Court pursuant to application of Ohio, issued writ of mandamus, commanding the officers of the state to pay the entire increases -- the officers of the State of Ohio to pay the entire increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.220" offset="5324257">The United States instituted this action and the United States District Court of the Southern District of Ohio to enjoin Ohio and its officers from paying out the increases that were in excess of those authorized by the Pay Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.521" offset="5397504">And the District Court restrained Ohio from paying the increases and the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals issued a permanent injunction on October 25, 1973, restraining Ohio and its officers from paying these increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.241" offset="5472319">I might add that since the termination of the Economic Stabilization Act of -- on April 30, 1974 there's been no application by the petitioners for dissolution of that injunction which is still in full force and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.911" offset="5551000">But mind you, the injunction was entered before the expiration of the Act.</text>

            <label>Ms. Lafontant</label>
            <text syncTime="1374.488" offset="5601364">Would we resist?</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.764" offset="5630412">I would assume so based on the particular facts, we perhaps would resist it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.331" offset="5660714">I think it would turn upon the briefings that are brought to us whether or not we would still be in good stead in resisting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.390" offset="5700942">We would still have the authority and we might not resist it but certainly we would have that right, and I can't see at this point whether we would or would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.084" offset="5751724">But I am saying that the petitioners were in the position at that time to move to dissolve the injunction because the Act was no longer in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.732" offset="5798327">Now this Court has consistently refused to pass upon the constitutionality of the statute where at the time that it comes before the court, the statute has expired by its own terms or has been repealed or has ceased to be of any effect, and of course we know so many other cases that substantiate there and I have in mind in particular the Rice versus Sioux City Memorial Cemetery case where after this Court have granted a writ of certiorari upon learning that the particular state had repealed its law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.261" offset="5968436">This Court dismissed the writ of certiorari for being improvidently granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.303" offset="6000619">At this point I would like to say too that the Government has not asked that this case be dismissed for being improvidently granted or exact languages that we wanted that we think it should be dismissed because it is no longer continuing importance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1497.025" offset="6091421">Yes it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.245" offset="6100302">And in the instant case, the economic stabilization expired on its own terms as I said on April 30, 1974 but of course this writ of certiorari was issued before that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.732" offset="6154324">Now beside the purely abstract question of the right of Ohio to pay wages to its employees without any restraints or interference from the federal government, the only matter before the court is the residual pecuniary interest of these employees to the amount of the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.747" offset="6238333">That is some $15 million and when spread over all of the employees amounts to around $200 or more for each employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.067" offset="6279607">The immediate restraint upon Ohio that prevents it from paying the money to the employees is the injunctive order of the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.786" offset="6338539">Because of the fact that the purpose of the Act and of the injunctive order, in support of the Act was to reduce during the effectiveness of the act supply of money in circulation by putting a limit on pay increases it would seem to me that a very substantial question of law is now raised and that question is whether upon the termination of the Act, application for dissolution of the injunction, should not be granted as a matter of right to petitioners. This is a legal question that should be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.066" offset="6499662">We respectfully submit that at the expiration of the Act, the petitioner should have made application to the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals for dissolution of the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.193" offset="6544175">They did not but instead they chose to pursue the attack on the constitutionality of the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.932" offset="6591091">We submit that the constitutionality issue is of no longer continuing importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.328" offset="6616691">Thus writ of certiorari was properly granted because at that time, the act was in full force in effect but since it has been granted, the Act has expired and we say it's if no continuing importance, its not very likely that this case can -- this issue can arise in any other courts concerning wages and salaries for periods after April 30, 1974.</text>
