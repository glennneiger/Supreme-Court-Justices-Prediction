            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="26.810" offset="107207">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.403" offset="117551">We are here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.268" offset="133016">Respondents are four aliens who have been denied employment in the Federal Competitive Civil Service by a reason of the Civil Service Commission’s regulation requiring that applicants, for most positions, be either citizens of the United States or persons owing the United States Allegiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.089" offset="196336">Respondents filed a class action challenging this regulation unconstitutional on other grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.126" offset="216503">The District Court, on the Government’s motion, dismissed for failure to state a claim; the Ninth Circuit reversed holding that the regulation violates the equal protection principle of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.678" offset="266658">The Court said that alienage is a suspect classification so that the compelling governmental interest must be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.933" offset="295706">The Court of Appeal relied as we believe mistakenly on the cases of this Court in Graham against Richardson and Sugarman against Dougall.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.142" offset="328516">Those cases concern state restrictions on the eligibility of aliens for state employment and state welfare benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.759" offset="362998">It is our contention that the Civil Service Commission’s regulation is a valid exercise of a national power, and I reach that result in alternative ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.208" offset="396748">My first submission is that the equal protection principle has no application to the Federal Government’s dealings with aliens as aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.888" offset="431543">I want to be quite clear about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.799" offset="443141">The equal protection principle obviously applies to persons, which includes of course aliens and it protects them from a variety of inequalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.347" offset="477309">For example, inequalities on account of race, inequalities on account of religion, but my submission is that the equal protection principle does not apply to a pure alienage classification.</text>

            <text syncTime="199.151" offset="796526">I think one need not practice and anticipate that particular result.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="204.358" offset="817424">The contention is that the aliens have the explicit guarantees of the Constitution, for example, Congress could not provide Ex post facto punishment for an alien who would rob the bank. Congress could not deprive of an alien of due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.415" offset="881580">Congress could not deprive the alien of his First Amendment right to speak or to worship.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.729" offset="906867">Congress may do none of those things and Congress may not treat an alien differently from other person on the grounds that he is Black or White or Yellow or a female, but I think Congress has plenary power with respect to alienage.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="244.227" offset="976875">Well precisely, Mr. Justice Marshall, because whereas the states in the cases that we dealt with in Sugarman against Dougall and Graham against Richardson and In re Griffiths and so forth, have no power given to them by the Federal Constitution over aliens as a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.928" offset="1059631">The Federal Government has plenary power, extraordinary power, over alienage and aliens as a class, not only the power coming from Article 1 Section 8 Clause 4 which gives explicit power to legislate with respect to immigration and naturalization, but indeed the inherent powers arising out of the power to conduct foreign policy, the power of national defense, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.415" offset="1157642">And, indeed, the Constitution itself, in many places, Article 4, confines privileges and immunities to citizens, so that, for purposes of federal legislation, alienage is not only a suspect classification, it is an inevitable classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.379" offset="1229427">The Federal Government had not only the power but the duty to legislate with respect to aliens as a class.</text>

            <text syncTime="332.749" offset="1330991">The respondents’ claim here, and I think the only way respondents can prevail, is that alienage is a suspect classification, which I think is quite wrong in this context, and therefore we must show the most compelling governmental need to classify with respect to alienage.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.460" offset="1405806">If that were true, I do not see how any federal legislation with respect to alienage is going to survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.196" offset="1432764">I do not know of a statute off hand that has ever survived this great judicial scrutiny test.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.837" offset="1475291">So that if we say that a compelling governmental interest must be shown, I doubt it will ever be shown with respect to any of these statutes that we have in our brief in the appendix and our supplemental brief in the appendix over 200 provisions in the Federal Code which classify, one way or another, by alienage.</text>

            <text syncTime="782.925" offset="3131664">One thing that requiring residents in this country for five years does is to give, in the ordinary case, a track record for the person applying and a way of checking about him in a situation where you probably need some kind of talent.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.044" offset="3204075">Somebody has not been there five years, you expend the resources to do the checking or take your chances, and that seems to me in no way to cast doubt upon the general rule of the Federal Government sees fit to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.704" offset="3270740">But my main point is that we have here an exercise by the Civil Service Commission of a delegated combined power of Congress and the President, and those are powers relating to naturalization to foreign policy, to national defense, and to treaty making.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.398" offset="3341584">In fact, I think what has been exercised is a power that is inherent without even respect to the constitutional provision of the very idea of a nation states which possesses sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.120" offset="3380454">Every nation state distinguishes between those who owe allegiance to it and those who do not, and so obvious is that that I think every nation or virtually every nation in the world makes that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.624" offset="3442416">And I think so obvious is it that it has been exercised and gone uncontested for over 90 years in this country in this explicit form, and I think that is constitutionally a relevant factor, because it gives this practice all of the support that long continued in the university accepted usage confers.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.946" offset="3527784">Now I think those are what make this case different from the state cases, Sugarman and Graham.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.453" offset="3549727">Respondents’ only argument in this connection is I think both a simplistic and a mechanical one, and that argument runs as follows: Whenever an equal protection principle has been formulated in a case involving a state, that principle must automatically be applied against the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.878" offset="3619422">Their example is the formulation of the equal protection principle in Brown against Board of Education applied against the Federal Government in Bolling against Sharpe.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.323" offset="3653277">And I think that argument is patently fallacious, because that progression from state to federal cannot be made when the Constitution explicitly gives the Federal Government the power and, as I say, the duty to legislate about aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.888" offset="3727464">States are not independent sovereigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.941" offset="3735719">They do not have the power to naturalize.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.651" offset="3742511">They do not have the power to conduct foreign affairs, to make decisions about national defense, to make treaties, and they have none of the powers which give Congress power over aliens and over alienage.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.252" offset="3792980">When we move from state cases like Sugarman and Graham against Richardson, we really move into a whole new framework of cases like the Chinese exclusion case, cases like Harisiades against Shaughnessy, Kleindienst against Mandel, cases that show an extraordinary degree of power in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.307" offset="3877198">I think it is incontestable as the Chief Justice’s question a moment ago pointed out that Congress has the power to exclude aliens in this country all together, and that is a corollary of that power.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="1017.275" offset="4069042">Well, because we are dealing with unconstitutional conditions, Mr. Justice Stewart, we are dealing with explicit guarantees that are asked to be given up by the alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.542" offset="4106136">Here, I am merely suggesting that they could have been admitted on the condition that they not apply for federal employment until they are naturalized, which I think is not an unconstitutional condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.902" offset="4155559">And my claim is much less broad than it may have seemed when I began that line of development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.852" offset="4187324">But, for example, Congress now excludes aliens from entry to perform certain kinds of labor, skilled or unskilled, unless they get a certification from the Secretary of Labor that they are not taking away a job of an American citizen, and if an alien violates that, I am sure he may be deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.232" offset="4272901">That is the kind of condition I am talking about that could be attached to the shore and, therefore, I think this kind of condition about not seeking federal employment could be attached at the shore, but that is not essential to my argument because in any case the federal power to admit or to exclude or to deport is plenary, and is necessarily intertwined with decisions about the alien’s rights and obligations while he is in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.628" offset="4390452">There is no way the two can be separated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1099.596" offset="4398289">Well, I think you could certainly separate them by simply not going so far as you do in saying that Congress’ power has to do with the exclusion and deportation of aliens and not with all these other things you have talked about, and not with what it is involved in this case that this does not have to do with exclusion or deportation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="1121.977" offset="4487837">Well Mr. Justice Stewart, again, what I meant by the fact that they are inevitably intertwined, I think it is right and I think it is right not because of a legal point but simply because Congress’ decision about how many people to admit will necessarily be affected by the power they have over aliens here, so that the less power Congress has to classify is to alienage in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.590" offset="4598282">That may affect, indeed in some cases will affect, the Congress’ decision about time for naturalization, degree of numbers entering, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.270" offset="4644989">And it is because it is intertwined I think that historically we have viewed Congress as having such power over aliens in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.232" offset="4684904">Now, Congress has been very liberal in its provisions for aliens but I think that there is absolutely no constitutional necessity that the package of rights and obligations that they provide for aliens be of equal value to the package possessed by citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.326" offset="4749270">And I think, to begin now to require Congress or to take away from Congress effectively by applying this compelling governmental interest test would be to take away from Congress almost all its power in this field, and I think that would be a constitutional innovation for which I can find no warrant in the text or in the history or indeed in the policy of the Constitution, and that is why I say I think the only fully satisfactory formulation of the law, with respect to resident aliens, is that it protects aliens as persons but not in their status as aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.343" offset="4901303">I think that is a logical answer to this case, but I would like to move on to the -- if this Court disagrees and thinks that the equal protection analysis is, in some degree, relevant, as we have discussed, there are of course two degrees of severity with which that analysis applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.589" offset="4966296">And I think the proper test here, because of the federal power in this field, is at most the rational basis test, anything more would take Congress almost out of the game.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.474" offset="5021884">I think in the context of a federal case involving a federal power, it is appropriate to note that alienage is not, like race or sex, an immutable characteristic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.322" offset="5065247">The disability imposed by this regulation is temporary and is limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.997" offset="5087922">Naturalization and the privileges of citizenship are available in five years or three years if the alien marries a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.868" offset="5135464">Now in fact, the other appropriateness of calling alienage a suspect category in this case is demonstrated by a fact to which I have been informed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and that is that two of the four respondents in this case, two of the four, have now applied for and received citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.462" offset="5213832">All four of them are eligible the last time this case was argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.761" offset="5230968">In fact, Mow Sun Wong, the lead plaintiff, I am informed, was naturalized on January 7, 1975 which was five days before this case was argued last term, and Mr. Mok was naturalized in September 16, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.941" offset="5303693">Now, the fact that they can choose, all of them can choose to be citizens, and two of the respondents have acquired citizenship and all of the rights that go with it, seems to me to illustrate dramatically how unrealistic it is to speed of aliens in a federal context as a suspect classification whose rights must be protected because they are persons who are discriminated against -- as persons who are discriminated against on grounds of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.806" offset="5439216">They can move out of the category easily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.308" offset="5449143">Two of the four respondents here have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.044" offset="5456144">I trust, if the other remaining two do become citizens before this case is decided, counsel of respondents will tell us, will tell the Court -- but there is simply no reality to the claim of suspect classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.364" offset="5521450">Now, turning to the rational relation test just very briefly, I want to say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.954" offset="5551752">If this regulation must pass the national relation test, I think it does so quite easily, and I will mention just three relationships it has to a permissible governmental purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.087" offset="5608281">In the first place, it offers an inducement for resident aliens to acquire knowledge of this country, our language, something of our government to proclaim allegiance and to become citizens, and I think Congress may legitimately wish to induce aliens living here to integrate themselves into our national life and our political community by becoming citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.905" offset="5703576">One of the respondents, as we discussed last time, has now been here for over 29 years and has not troubled to apply for citizenship, and I see no reason why Congress may not have a policy to induce such a person to declare that integration in our political community that an application for on the receipt of citizenship implies and shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.238" offset="5808901">I do not think this is a matter to be taken lightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.544" offset="5818096">It is a force, an actual force and a symbolic force with some importance making for the cohesion of the political community to which we belong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.620" offset="5866475">There was, I think last time we discussed this case, some mention of xenophobia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.354" offset="5881313">I do not think that is involved here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.131" offset="5892493">This country traditionally and today is more hospitable to aliens and makes naturalization easier than most.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.387" offset="5921541">If xenophobia were involved, Congress would simply bar all aliens from our shores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.134" offset="5948500">This legislative and presidential purpose alone, I think, that of integrating people into the national political community and strengthening the cohesion of that community symbolically and actually I think is sufficient to justify the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.186" offset="6016731">But if I were to make another point, I would say that there is an administrative burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.047" offset="6036167">Obviously, aliens may be kept from some kinds of positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.300" offset="6053198">Obviously, aliens may be kept from even menial positions in some kinds of federal facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.782" offset="6087053">Obviously, it is more difficult to check an alien’s background if he has not been here some sufficient period of time to establish a record in this country, I take that the government is entitled, as suggested in other cases recently, to make a broad rule to take care of administrative difficulties of that kind and not have to follow aliens to make sure they are not transferred to the wrong place to keep reclassifying jobs as situation changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.044" offset="6224144">And finally, I would suggest that in the federal context it is important to note and legitimate to note that the federal payroll has become an important means for implementing social policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.767" offset="6266984">Federal affirmative hiring programs that helped to counterbalance discrimination of the private sector, and I think Congress may wish to maximize the effectiveness of the federal payroll in this function by confining it to citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.951" offset="6327798">None of the three objectives I have mentioned is impermissible; none of them I think is able.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.132" offset="6344516">Each of them bares a rational relation to the regulation of the Commission, which means the regulation does not offend the equal protection principle of the Fifth Amendment, and we ask that the judgment of the Court of Appeals be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1609.528" offset="6438034">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.445" offset="6449737">The Government today, as it has done in the past, is trying to paint this case for what it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.162" offset="6468545">The Government is trying to paint this case as one involving plenary power of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.232" offset="6484846">This case does not although, as we shall argue later, if it does, the Government’s actions are not immune from constitutional strictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.272" offset="6513058">The plenary power of Congress stands over this area, which we are discussing, stems from the Constitution, Article 1 Section 8 Clause 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.950" offset="6547749">The only words in the Constitution are naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.076" offset="6556212">Congress has power over naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.486" offset="6565930">This Court, in cases as recent as Sugarman and Griffiths, has interpreted that to mean Congress has plenary power over immigration and naturalization and, as it is pointed out today, immigration connotes entry to this country, deportation, and naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.750" offset="6618906">Issues where national security, foreign affairs, and this country’s sovereignty are inevitably intertwined, that is not involved today.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="1663.573" offset="6654224">What would be your answer to the hypothetical about the power of Congress to enact the statute that is required aliens A - to learn the language of the country so that they can pass the test within five years and apply for citizenship within five years or B - deported at the end of that time?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_h_steinman" startTime="1684.313" stopTime="1932.272">
            <label>Mr. Edward H. Steinman</label>
            <text syncTime="1684.313" offset="6737189">Naturally, I already have the language requirement to be a citizen, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.508" offset="6749936">I think that if Congress is dealing in areas as naturalization and emphasize to Congress, as Mr. Justice Stevens says, we do not have even a statue today really dealing with aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.229" offset="6784836">But if Congress was acting in regard to naturalization that would be a clear indication that it was exercised its plenary power and in that area, this Court’s role is not eliminated but the test is quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.558" offset="6826214">I think the Court then gives far greater deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.435" offset="6837708">The notion that somehow this case is going to lead to this Court automatically striking down 200 statutes is just not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.479" offset="6865816">First of all, many of those statutes involve appointed officials and I think that aliens may have difficulty raised in standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.573" offset="6894237">Many of those statutes only involve a mere few people and not the millions involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.600" offset="6914299">Most importantly, many of those statutes involved issues of national affairs, security, the sovereignty of this country, and regardless of what test this Court utilizes, whether this Court talks about the status of aliens, suspect class, whether this Court talks about conditions not being rationally related, whether this Court talks about presumptions being irrebuttable or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.695" offset="6998727">The fact is this Government surely has the right in certain circumstances, clear precise tailored circumstances, not to allow aliens to do certain things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.503" offset="7037910">The problem in this case, of course, as the problem in other cases this Court has dealt with, is the total blanket exclusion, and one of the interesting points, which Your Honor mentioned, is that the Government has explicitly in other areas and the Atomic Energy Commission example, Your Honors, in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.172" offset="7096633">It is noted at Page 84 and 72 of the Government’s brief, the Government in areas involving the essence of national security, the Atomic Energy Commission, the Department of Defense, NASA, highest officials in the Executive Branch, has, by statute, allowed aliens to work in those departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.068" offset="7168209">Again, in example of tailoring, what I do want to emphasize is that this case does not involve immigration and does not involve plenary power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.118" offset="7200392">What it involves is a blanket exclusion against individuals who have been lawfully admitted and, if I may quote to this Court the decision of this Court in 1970, “Once an alien lawfully enters and resides in this country, he becomes invested with the rights guaranteed by the Constitution to all people within our borders.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.812" offset="7267161">These rights are not alienable and guard against any encroachment by either federal or state authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.893" offset="7287536">The decision is Hellenic Lines versus Rhoditis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.517" offset="7297985">It appears at Page 39 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.056" offset="7308121">One of the problems that I have with the Solicitor General’s argument is that he concedes to this Court that a certain particular rights in the Constitution apply to resident aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.795" offset="7347096">He conceded today that the First Amendment applies, that due process applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.666" offset="7366635">As Mr. Justice Marshall asked, then why does not equal protection apply?</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.954" offset="7379801">Why is the Government allowed to be selective?</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.623" offset="7390459">The fact that equal protection may involve inherent classification is not an answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.709" offset="7410834">Consider a hypothetical of Congress saying that aliens do not have First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.578" offset="7430269">I submit to you that that is a classification between aliens and citizens, but, as the Solicitor General conceded today, under the Court’s decision resident aliens clearly have First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.713" offset="7478753">I think it is important to emphasize in this case, the facts that what these people were seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.913" offset="7499651">And, by the way, Your Honor, I did not know last year that one of my clients had become a citizen and I was aware that another had, but it is very clear from this Court’s decisions that one does not have to be a citizen to take advantage of constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.337" offset="7549283">Mr. Justice Powell in the Griffiths case recognized that the person in that case chose not to exercise the right to be a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.902" offset="7575510">In Sugarman versus Dougall, two of the four named appellees had been here long enough to qualify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.172" offset="7596617">In Graham versus Richardson, Mrs. Graham had been here much longer than the requisite period of time to become a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.835" offset="7619291">This Court did not require the individuals there to exercise that option; this Court should not require it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.798" offset="7643115">What my clients were seeking was to work as a janitor, a file clerk, loading and unloading mail at the Post Office, and as an evaluator of educational programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.178" offset="7680627">One of the ironies of course is that three of them at one time worked for the Federal Government, two in the California State Program which paid their salaries, one respondent Louie, who inadvertently got a job at the Post Office.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="1932.272" offset="7729006">But no one has questioned, that I am aware of, the power of the United States Government to hire aliens if they want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.356" offset="7761398">That is not involved here, is it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_h_steinman" startTime="1942.501" stopTime="2128.148">
            <label>Mr. Edward H. Steinman</label>
            <text syncTime="1942.501" offset="7769966">I point the irony because they actually got it wrong, if you will, the regulation involved here, although they did not get around to it totally and then they worked outstandingly according to the appendix, the evaluation of their supervisors, and yet, because of this blanket exclusion in the regulation not the statute, they had to leave federal employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.989" offset="7847915">And I think also it should be noted that the exclusion in the federal regulation says that to work for the Federal Government you must be a citizen or owe permanent allegiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.217" offset="7884800">Unfortunately, the Federal Government has taken the position, which I have never seen justified, that owing permanent allegiance means only individuals from American Samoa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.283" offset="7917087">I point you to the government’s brief, Page 81, note 67.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.088" offset="7932343">I do not know why owing permanent allegiance cannot be extended to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.607" offset="7946344">For example, three of my four named plaintiffs, at the time this case had been brought, filed declarations of intent to become a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.441" offset="7973721">It is too bad that they had to wait five years to exercise their option to become citizens before they became open to federal employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.427" offset="8001620">What I would like to emphasize to this Court is that, given the nature of the jobs that they sought not involving natural security, given that they had performed outstandingly, there is no justification to exclude them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.504" offset="8053969">Clearly, the Court below relied on compelling interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.130" offset="8064418">We, as Mr. Justice Powell indicated in the Griffiths case, we are not concerned with labels, whether this Court calls it overriding interest, an important interest, compelling interest, whether this Court uses the rational relationship test, whether this Court uses irrebuttable presumption, because clearly this regulation creates an irrebuttable presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.740" offset="8130873">We are concerned with the fact that aliens, solely because of their status, are excluded from federal employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.359" offset="8157414">Mr. Bork said that in regard to Federal Government aliens are not a suspect classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.951" offset="8175804">I submit that they strongly are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.470" offset="8185835">This Court has said continually that aliens are inherently suspect; they are an example of a discreet and insular minority for whom such heightened judicial solicitude is appropriate from Graham and Sugarman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.702" offset="8234736">They are inherently suspect even if it is the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.587" offset="8246335">They are examples of discreet and insular minorities even to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.616" offset="8266397">The fact that the disability is not one that is long, the fact that these appellees can become citizens is not relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.926" offset="8295654">It was not relevant to this Court in Graham; it was not relevant in Sugarman; it was not relevant in Griffiths.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.346" offset="8317283">The point is that the suspect classification remains the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.891" offset="8331494">What is different in this case is the interest which the Government can assert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.362" offset="8349362">That is why the lower court did not say that Sugarman and Graham were dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.407" offset="8369528">It found them helpful but not squarely controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.911" offset="8379559">What one must do is analyze the interests that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.083" offset="8392307">As we submit, the Government must be required to show the strongest possible interest, but even if you do not require that, even if you use the traditional rational relationship test, I submit to you that the rationales offered by the Government are very, very weak.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.754" offset="8455001">For example, the Government says that one of the rationales is that we want to induce aliens to become citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.473" offset="8477884">Well, first of all, there are numerous statutes which allow non-citizens to work for the Federal Government including the most sensitive positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.976" offset="8503902">Clearly, those are not inducive to become citizens.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="2128.148" offset="8512575">But those statutory exceptions are for the benefit of the United States’ own interests, are they not?</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.145" offset="8540578">That is, if we want to hire or the United States want to hire Wernher Von Braun or other scientist, the United States surely has plenary power to waive these considerations, do they not?</text>

            <text syncTime="2151.707" offset="8606824">Since the statute is silent, I do not know if we can say that was in Congress’ mind but there are no facts to say what was on the mind of the Civil Service Commission that the reason for the regulation was to induce citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.010" offset="8647993">Obviously, one of the ways this Court could have answered that in Sugarman versus Dougall was to say that the states by having requirements that to work with the State Civil Service, you must be a citizen would be enhancing the congressional role in inducing citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="2725.271" offset="10901002">I think factually, Your Honor, we have filed amicus briefs that show that the unemployment rate among resident aliens, unfortunately, in the San Francisco Bay area, is three to four times that of citizens and although, clearly, if a resident alien gets a job, you replace a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.600" offset="10958367">I think the amice shows that it is far easier for citizens, at least where I come from, to get employment than resident aliens.</text>

            <text syncTime="2798.231" offset="11192842">I would hope that as this Court has recognized in the area of constitutional law, the fact that a policy has existed for a long time, does not immunize it from constitutional protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.311" offset="11229205">Likewise, the fact that the Civil Service Commission has, for many decades, foreclosed aliens from federal employment should not immunize it from the test that this Court has laid down in relation to the explicit specific authorization that Congress must give in executive or administrative body when dealing with an important interest such as at stake here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2897.772" offset="11591053">Well, if your hypothetical is correct, excuse me, that it was an attribution of sovereignty, then I would submit that the fact that Congress’ plenary powers are involved does not mean that this Court gives an absolute okay to what is going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.398" offset="11641522">This Court still has a role to play.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.356" offset="11649358">Our brief annunciates the numerous cases using the war powers where this Court has said “the talismanic incantation of a plenary power cannot immunize the Congress’ action under the Constitution.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.227" offset="11696901">Clearly, though, if the plenary power is present, I would concede that the Court’s test is more deferential, but, as I stated here, I do not believe the plenary power is present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.102" offset="11736398">In closing, I would like to say that the only justification or reason that really exists for the total exclusion of resident aliens from all federal employment is that they are aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.739" offset="11782896">To state that would confess discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.595" offset="11794286">Hence, the petitioners are silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.368" offset="11805466">I submit that such silence can no longer immunize the constitutional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.112" offset="11824379">As this Court has said in Graham versus Richardson that Congress does not have the power to authorize individual estates to violate the Equal Protection Clause, I would submit that when Congress is not acting in areas of deportation, naturalization, and immigration Congress itself cannot authorize its own violation of the equal protection guarantees of the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="2975.978" offset="11903896">But why is not a limitation of government employment to citizens an act of the government relating to naturalization?</text>

            <text syncTime="2988.162" offset="11952588">Well, I have a couple of answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.385" offset="11957499">First of all, this Congress has clearly never stated that, and I do not think it is just because it is not in Title 8 of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.760" offset="11995011">Secondly, the fact that it may be related to naturalization does not explain then why everything else is not related to naturalization, for example, a resident alien exercising his First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.787" offset="12043076">We want to encourage resident aliens to become citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.179" offset="12052689">Hence, we deny them for five years First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.905" offset="12063556">This Court would not accept such an argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward H. Steinman</label>
            <text syncTime="3023.104" offset="12092395">Well, I think that outside of the area of deportation, naturalization, and immigration where it clearly relates to that plenary power, the reason that is obvious, Your Honor, I think is that because the Constitution does treat resident aliens under the Fifth Amendment protections, that we would not tolerate saying that resident aliens does not have First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.986" offset="12171912">That is why I say we should not tolerate that a resident alien does not have equal protection rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.979" offset="12187899">What is different, vis-à-vis the citizen, is that the governmental interest and the way those interests are balanced will be quite different for the resident alien than they are for citizens.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="3064.651" offset="12258534">Just a scattering of points, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.421" offset="12265639">The reference has been made to whether or not Congress intended this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.446" offset="12293747">I would like to refer you to our main -- the Court to our main brief, Page 71 and following pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.233" offset="12324885">It must be quite plain, for example, Footnote 63 on page 78, Senator Holly said, when he was heading up this Commission, “It would be among the duties of the Commission to devise rules for conducting examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.940" offset="12371696">There will be requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.325" offset="12377234">Anybody can think of a few in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.196" offset="12384758">The applicant must be a citizen of the United States” and on and on in other quotes from Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.313" offset="12405238">It is quite clear that Congress intended this and it is also quite clear that Congress need not, in intending such a classification, make a statement of their rational purpose which is satisfactory to respondents’ counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="3119.406" offset="12477544">Of our initial brief, Your Honor, it is Page 78, Footnote 63.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.501" offset="12501995">I just cited that because it is an extraordinary clear statement by Senator Holly that Congress assumed citizenship in this area as, indeed, everybody has.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3141.143" offset="12564480">Mr. Solicitor General, they did assume it but they did not explicitly require it in the statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="3147.231" stopTime="3277.756">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="3147.231" offset="12588826">The statute does not say there must be citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.883" offset="12607530">Congress assumed apparently that anybody carrying that out would naturally require citizenship and Congress has been aware of this practice over the years and in legislative enlightenment and in the public works statute, Public Works Act, which we discuss in Page 83 of our brief, they have been saying that salaries may not be paid to aliens in this country with certain exemptions if they work for the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.933" offset="12703660">So that this is the congressional policy; there is no doubt about that, as well as a presidential policy, which is why I said the policy came to us with a combined weight of the Congress and the presidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.059" offset="12752144">But, on the question of the suspect classification, Pardon me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.207" offset="12772728">On the question of the suspect classification, I would like to direct the Court’s attention to Johnson against Robison decided in 1974 in which conscientious objectors who, one assumes, will always have the record of a conscientious objectors has held, conscientious objectors are held not to be a suspect classification, and I would think that if that is the case then aliens who can leave the category certainly do not qualify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.189" offset="12884741">In this case, essentially, we are being told by respondents’ counsel that they do not like any imposition of obligations upon aliens whichever way you do it, because we are told that this statute or regulation is overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.501" offset="12933956">We are required to make individualized determinations, and the Weinberger against Salfi suggests that we are not required if there is good reason not to require us to expend resources to make individualized determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.948" offset="12987768">But, on the other hand, it is held against us by respondents’ counsel that in some areas of government the government finds it useful to make individualized determinations and to hire aliens, so that we are attacked both over breadth and under breadth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.522" offset="13046073">I submit that this is a traditional power and clearly a constitutional power of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.032" offset="13072091">There is no inequity involved and it would be extraordinary to change a constitutional power in practice of this sort for these reasons at this time.</text>
