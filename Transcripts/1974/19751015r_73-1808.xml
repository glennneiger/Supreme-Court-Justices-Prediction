            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="42.074" offset="168229">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.588" offset="178260">These two consolidated cases come here on writs of certiorari for the United States Courts of Appeals for the Second and Sixth Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.538" offset="218070">The Circuits have split on the question whether the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is required to issue a notice of deficiency in connection with his termination of a taxpayer’s taxable year pursuant to his statutory authority under Section 6851 of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.590" offset="294348">The practical significance of this procedural question focuses on the Anti-Injunction Act which the Court has had recent opportunity to explore Section 7421a of the Code which is set forth in our brief at page 65 in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.220" offset="372820">That provision, generally, provides that no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment to a collection of any tax shall be maintained in any Court by any person.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.423" offset="421616">And, if the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is not required to issue a notice of deficiency in these cases, which we submit is the case, then these suits are barred by that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.928" offset="467696">Now, the taxpayers in these cases and the Courts that have held against our position have focused on the prefatory exception phrase at the Anti-Injunction Act which provides acceptance provided in Section 6212a and c, 6213a.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.447" offset="549721">Now, that prefatory exception deals with cases which are adjudicable by the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.738" offset="578873">So, in script of all the statutory language, these cases really present the question whether it is an assessment of taxes which are deemed to be immediately due and payable under Section 6851a are adjudicable by the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.668" offset="658599">Now, we submit that the terms of the statute of and the historical evidence clearly indicates that Congress decided not to give the Tax Court jurisdiction in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.200" offset="704784">That is, that when the Commissioner terminates someone’s taxable year in the middle of that year and then makes an assessment pursuant to Section 6201a of taxes immediately due and payable, that that administrative action is not immediately reviewable in the Tax Court but that the taxpayer must seek other remedies specifically the refund suit ruled in the District Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>

            <text syncTime="222.013" offset="887954">There was testimony held this summer before a subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee, I understand, but I am not prepared to speak about the details of those proposals and I think that it is entirely speculative at this juncture whether there will be any litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.765" offset="955037">Nevertheless, the conflict continues to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.275" offset="969038">The facts of --</text>

          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="243.622" stopTime="258.605">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="243.622" offset="974472">Incidentally, while we have you interrupted, there is pending here another tax case, United States v. Shapiro and, somewhere in your argument, will you relate that one to these cases if there is any relationship?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="258.605" stopTime="368.057">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="258.605" offset="1034344">I can do it right now, Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.303" offset="1045211">The issue in the Shapiro case.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.556" offset="1054198">Shapiro involves a jeopardy assessment under Section 6861a which we contend, in this case, is an entirely distinct statutory provision which should not be merged into the termination provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.251" offset="1116996">The question in Shapiro is a burden of proof question.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.165" offset="1132565">Our position in that case is that the Court of Appeals has improperly imposed upon the government, the burden of proving the validity of its assessment in a straight injunctive action.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.166" offset="1188571">In other words, what happened to the taxpayer in Shapiro was simply that he was subjected to an early assessment, under Section 6861a, not a termination and he sued to enjoin that assessment and was, of course, bound by the Court’s judicially created exception in the Enochs v. Williams Packing Co. case.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.180" offset="1276656">And, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that, in no circumstances, the Commissioner was obliged to come forward with some sort of evidence demonstrating the validity of his assessment, and we think our position in that case is that the burden of proof rests on the taxpayer to demonstrate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.564" offset="1366204">Number one, he is entitled to equitable relief because no adequate remedy of law is available and, number two, that under no circumstances can the government prevail on the merits of its claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.980" offset="1407896">So to the extent that both cases involving the Anti-Injunction Act, they are related but they involve these disparate provisions of the Code, the termination provision and the early assessment provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.436" offset="1457737">I think that the facts can be briefly stated and they are basically undisputed--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="368.057" stopTime="372.382">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="368.057" offset="1472157">Do you feel they are disparate provisions?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="372.382" stopTime="556.784">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="372.382" offset="1489502">Yes, we do and, in fact, it is our submission that the confusion that has risen in the area has risen out of an incorrect interpretation of the statutory history that these statutes both came in separately with design to do quite separate things and that the terms of one should not be judicially incorporated into the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.241" offset="1604963">Before I get into the legal questions, I think it probably would be worthwhile to review briefly the facts in both of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.104" offset="1640385">In the Laing case from the Second Circuit, the taxpayer is a citizen of New Zealand.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.826" offset="1663269">In May 1972, he entered the United States from Canada on a visitor’s visa.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.334" offset="1689287">On the evening of July 24, 1972, in fact in the early morning hours, he and two other people in a rented automobile attempted to reenter Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.705" offset="1746756">The Canadian officials were dissatisfied with the identification proffered by one of the passengers in the vehicle and they refused entry to the trio into Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.723" offset="1790851">They then had to turn around and go back to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.067" offset="1804225">This was a crossing at Derby Line, Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.229" offset="1824914">Upon attempted reentry back into the United States, they were subjected to a search of their vehicle by the United States Customs and the search revealed that a suitcase in the engine compartment of the car contained approximately $300,000 in United States currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.061" offset="1908193">Search of the persons revealed that the petitioner in this case, Laing, had a quantity of hashish on his possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.368" offset="1937450">The Customs officials thereupon, as is the procedure, notified the District Director of Internal Revenue for the District of Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.390" offset="1973499">Because of the unusual happenstance, it is a highly unusual circumstance that people are traveling with so much cash concealed in the engine compartment of their car, and the Internal Revenue Service exercised its statutory power under Section 6851, the termination provision, and terminated the taxable years of all three passengers as of that date, June 24, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.934" offset="2079660">Now, ultimately, assessments of approximately $195,000 were imposed against each of the three persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.000" offset="2111948">These assessments, as I mentioned last time, were computed on the well-established net worth plus non-deductible expenditures method.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.184" offset="2152699">Petitioner Laing was questions as to how long he had been in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.503" offset="2165969">It turned out to be 25-30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.197" offset="2176731">The amount of money was quite of his net worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.986" offset="2195853">A sum was computed also for his non-deductible living expenses and then the tax computation easily follows from that.</text>

            <text syncTime="887.198" offset="3548787">The assessment in that case also proceeded on a projection of volume of activity and it came out to be something like $52,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.578" offset="3590269">Now, the taxpayer Hall, also refused to pay the tax but, contrary to what happened in the District Court of Vermont in the Second Circuit, the District Court granted a preliminary injunction and the Sixth Circuit affirmed on the authority of its decision in Rambo which is still awaiting disposition by the Court on our petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.083" offset="3672294">Now, we think that it is worthwhile to consider how these statutes come into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.813" offset="3707193">If you look at page 60 and 61 at our brief you see, as I have mentioned, that the Secretary or his delegates finds that a taxpayer either designs quickly to depart from the United States or intends to conceal himself or his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.226" offset="3768842">He can terminate someone’s taxable year.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.488" offset="3777933">Now that termination, by itself, that administrative action does not affect any collection activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.181" offset="3808653">All that we have is an artificial termination of the taxable year and a declaration that the taxes are immediately due and payable.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.586" offset="3850344">Without law, the Commissioner could not collect these taxes, but there is an assessment provision of the Code which we set forth at page 53 of our brief, Section 6201a.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.361" offset="3901440">And, that provision empowers the Secretary to make the inquiries determinations and assessments of all taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.294" offset="3933100">So, it is a combination of the termination power, and this assessment power, which is a very old statute, which, in its present form, dates around 1872 but actually is much older than that because it basically is the essential assessment power for the collection of taxes which have been going on since the beginning of the republic when the Secretary of the Treasury was Alexander Hamilton and the taxes were excised and the molasses and whiskey taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.076" offset="4048248">So, there is no doubt that this power exists and that it is independent of any other provision of the Code.</text>

            <text syncTime="1456.706" offset="5826769">Now, I think that once the distinction between the two situations arrive, is made clear, because in the early assessment provision it could simply mean that the taxpayer is going bankrupt or he is a person who fritters away his assets for one reason or another, and the taxpayer in such a situation if the Commissioner is going to take the normal route of allowing the Tax Court proceeding to stay collection until that is finished, then it is quite possible that whatever decision the Courts reach as to what the taxes are owing, there is not going to be any ability to collect on the deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.444" offset="6001685">Now, it seems to us that once that is understood, that is why the Tax Court has jurisdiction in the early assessment provision and not in the termination provision because if you look at page 71 of our brief which sets forth the Revenue Act of 1921, the proviso on page 71 of our brief which reads “provided that in cases where the Commissioner believes that the collection of the amount due will be jeopardized by such delay, he may make the assessment without giving such notice or waiting the conclusion of such hearing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.755" offset="6151001">That proviso came in as an exception to an administrative appeal procedure which was enacted in 1921, under which, a taxpayer could seek an administrative review and collection would not occur during that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.018" offset="6215993">Now, in order to provide for the situation where the taxpayer’s assets might not be available after the administrative review is complete, Congress enacted that proviso.</text>

            <text syncTime="1646.764" offset="6587037">I think that another important thing which I think deserves emphasis is the fact that when the Board of Tax Appeals was created in the Revenue Act of 1924, the Board was authorized to hear specifically enumerated cases, and those enumerated cases are set forth in our brief at page 32.</text>

            <text syncTime="1683.900" offset="6735517">I think the important thing is that when Congress set up the Board of Tax Appeals, which is the predecessor of the Tax Court, it enumerated a class of cases and notably absent from this list was termination cases under what was then Section 146 of the Code over the Revenue Act and is now the termination provision in the Revenue Code of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.781" offset="6835096">Now, it seems to us that Congress has made a conscious choice, and I think that the Courts that have gone astray on this question have taken the creation of the Board of Tax Appeals in the loosest possible and derived from it a lesson which we do not think is properly learned from.</text>

            <text syncTime="1770.303" offset="7081169">One, that the assessment power in a termination case derives from Section 6861 and, therefore, the statutes have to be merged because they operate in tandem.</text>

            <text syncTime="2340.818" offset="9363226">Yes, I will do the very best I can, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.472" offset="9385796">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.981" offset="9399902">I would like to comment briefly on something Mr. Justice Brennan said earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.797" offset="9415158">He mentioned that the House Ways and Means Committee is considering legislation to alter the jeopardy assessment procedure and, this summer, I had the pleasure of testifying as a witness before that committee but our hope that the fact that there is a move of foot in Congress to alter the jeopardy assessment provisions of the Code does not stop this Court from taking proper action in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.068" offset="9508258">The reason I say that is that sometimes, Congress takes a long time to do what should be done right away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.063" offset="9548173">In starting the argument, specifically in reference to Elizabeth Jane Hall, I would like to start with the comment made by Mr. Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.991" offset="9579938">He said that there has been a great deal of confusion concerning these code issues and what is before the Court and these various Courts, and he indicates that the Courts are confused because of various interpretation of these Code Sections that are at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.233" offset="9640856">Well, I would respectfully submit that a lot of the confusion that has occurred in these tax cases has been brought about by the activities of the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.550" offset="9678158">The government, each time, I understand its argument and what is at stake and what is an issue, they seem to wiggle away a little bit and change it slightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.681" offset="9718700">Today, I heard for the first time in Mr. Smith’s oral argument that the tax that was assessed, Mrs. Hall was based on a proposed amount of illegal controlled substances that she had sold during this 31-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.996" offset="9779931">In the first argument in January, he said the amount was based on information given by a confidential informant and, when the government argued this case at the Sixth Circuit, they stated they had no idea how this $52,000 fee was reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.088" offset="9840327">Also, in the genesis of this case if we go back on page 13 of the Appendix in this case, this is from the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.477" offset="9877838">This is actually a Xerox copy of the government document, but if we look at page 13 of the appendix, we see that the government sends out a tax bill to Mrs. Hall and on the tax bill, I will read this to the court, it says “this notice of tax due on your return identified above.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.562" offset="9954220">Then, we look above and we see that this is a 1040 return according to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.418" offset="9977626">Well, such is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.175" offset="9984627">When we first entered this case, the government was alleging that there was a $52,000 deficit on Mrs. Hall’s tax return when no return had been filed at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.184" offset="10024647">So, we filed a complaint and said that if any return had been filed in Mrs. Hall’s name, it was a fraudulent tax return because Mrs. Hall did not file any tax return for that short period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.177" offset="10072607">Then when we get to the legal issues, we see that--</text>

            <text syncTime="2551.882" offset="10207504">I am just saying that a lot of the confusion that Mr. Smith refers to has been caused by the government and when we get to the actual legal decisions in this area, for example, in the Schreck case the government has had an enormous difficulty overcoming the idea of the assessment authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.862" offset="10275422">Mr. Justice White said, where does the authority come from?</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.417" offset="10289633">Well Mr. Smith, in his argument, he says it originates in 6201.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.847" offset="10311367">But, originally, the government argued in the Schreck case that 6851 in and of itself contained the implicit power to assess.</text>

            <text syncTime="2587.518" offset="10350028">It is not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.702" offset="10354730">There is plenty of law to this effect that the government does not have to be consistent in tax cases and they certainly have not been over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.148" offset="10380539">Then, I ask what the point is.</text>

            <text syncTime="2597.789" offset="10391092">Well, the point is that every time you nail them down and you say “is this what you are arguing?” and you are wrong on this issue, they slip away and argue it a little bit differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.344" offset="10429336">Now, before this Court--</text>

            <text syncTime="2611.691" offset="10446681">Yes, that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.481" offset="10461832">Okay, now, I was getting into the meat of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.309" offset="10477192">In this particular case, the government has argued that the assessment authority originates in 6201 and this is a general provision of assessment authority granted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.930" offset="10523690">But if we examine 6201, as I stated in the brief, this particular Section refers to taxes that are payable by a stand such as liquor taxes, gambling taxes, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.999" offset="10583980">Taxes that relate to income and jeopardy situations in income tax situations are found in 6851 and 6861 or a combination of both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.007" offset="10631941">Now, on the issue of deficiency which the Court questioned Mr. Smith about, the government, in the cases where they have prevailed, for example in the Irving case, they were able to convince the Court that what was assessed against the taxpayer really was not a tax at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.141" offset="10724519">And if take a look in the government’s brief, and I do not recall the exact page but I believe it was about page 26 of the government’s brief, they say that “we are not really assessing a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.172" offset="10776660">We are merely assessing a provisional amount that has to be paid, sort of an insurance policy that assures that the money will be there when and if the tax liability is established.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.066" offset="10824202">Now, at this point, the government is telling this Court and the Second Circuit and all the other Courts that there really is no tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.524" offset="10858057">Then when we raised the objection of Flora where he says, “we have not paid the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.466" offset="10877806">We cannot pay the tax because Mrs. Hall does not have the money,” when we raise the Flora objection and say the full payment rule prevents us from filing suit, they answer by saying “no, it does not because this really is not a tax and no deficiency is created.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.777" offset="10947082">Well, I think that that statement is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.217" offset="10968816">I think the only thing the government can collect against a citizen, the IRS at least, is a tax, and I cannot accept the provisional amount theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.570" offset="11030256">Now, if we accept the provisional amount theory, today, Mr. Smith is rigorously asserting the Anti-Injunction Act prohibits this type of suit, and he recited it to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.728" offset="11082815">But if we read the Anti-Injunction Act, it says that no action to restrain the collection of taxes shall be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.429" offset="11121685">So, if we adapt Mr. Smith’s theory that this really is not a tax, I would respectfully submit that the Anti-Injunction Act has no application and they can be enjoined from what they are doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.057" offset="11164212">I do not believe we have to go that far because I believe it is in 6861, the jeopardy assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.531" offset="11186051">I believe that is the correct Code Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.361" offset="11193365">But if we accept his argument on the provisional theory idea, then this really is not a tax and the Anti-Injunction Act does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.279" offset="11229100">This puts the government, in my opinion, in the interesting position where if they are trying to stop you from suing them, they say it is a tax but if they are trying to keep you out of Tax Court and keep you from litigating your claim without full payment, they say it is only a provisional amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.074" offset="11312274">Now, the case when it reached my desk, I had the feeling and I still do that there was something seriously wrong in the situation where the government could go out to a lady’s house and say “here is a tax bill for $52,000. Pay it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.181" offset="11396702">And Mr. Smith, very cavalierly says that “we refuse to pay the bill” or “there was not any way we could pay the bill” because Mrs. Hall simply did not have $52,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.666" offset="11442573">The $52,000 bill was approximately ten times her entire worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.864" offset="11467442">The provisions under the Code, full payment or post a bond for the total amount and full payment file a refund suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.335" offset="11501296">It left Mrs. Hall literally without a remedy, and the further I get into the case, the more unjust it seems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.115" offset="11532434">Every citizen, I think, has a fear of the Internal Revenue Service more so than the FBI or the CIA or any of these other organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.935" offset="11567647">And it may be veiled, fear in a remote fear at most times, but in the instant case, the fear of IRS was not only real but it was realized by Mrs. Hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.025" offset="11619997">Now, the government is not the type of organization that ever admits that it was in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.947" offset="11667749">No matter what they are doing, they always justify their actions by saying “this is for the common good and this is for some lofty purpose.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2960.974" offset="11843814">So, what I am pointing out, I thought I had gotten into it by saying that the fear was realized in Mrs. Hall’s case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.986" offset="11875892">The IRS actually showed up on her doorstep.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.517" offset="11886028">The IRS actually made a demand of her for a sum of money that far exceeded her total net worth and, as we have stated in the argument here in January and in the brief, at that time Mrs. Hall was without a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.194" offset="11944751">Mrs. Hall then proceeded to the United States District Court where she filed a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.033" offset="11964082">Now, 6851 assessments, according to the government, are tentative in nature and this is admitted by the government in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.546" offset="12022178">I cannot recall exactly where it is in the brief but they say these things are tentative in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.597" offset="12042344">Yet, based on this tentative tax liability, the IRS immediately drags off her automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.515" offset="12077976">A few days later, they put it up for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.529" offset="12090096">What could the government gain in such a situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.357" offset="12105352">In one of these equity balancing situations, Mrs. Hall was the one with everything to lose and, in theory, she could have actually lost her livelihood because not being able to make the full payment, not being able to make the $52,000 payment, the assessment against her would continue unless she could stop the Internal Revenue Service from continuing the process of collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.567" offset="12222171">In the last argument, I mentioned to the Court that the example if she goes to work on the following Monday morning and she draws a paycheck at the end of the week, the government can attach that paycheck and apply it to the $52,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.197" offset="12276715">In a way, she is in a very much more difficult position than Mr. Laing because Mr. Laing actually had the money and then the Clifford Irving case, Clifford Irving actually had the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.747" offset="12330945">But what happens to the taxpayer who does not have the money and cannot stop the collection procedure?</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.627" offset="12354456">They are trapped in a snowball that is rolling downhill that keeps getting bigger as it goes and there is nothing they can do about it unless they have the option of going into the United States District Court as Mrs. Hall did filing a suit, enjoining the Internal Revenue Service from the collection of its taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.038" offset="12440137">I think that I have pretty well explained our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.977" offset="12455811">If there are no questions, I will quit. I want to say that when I argued this case at the Sixth Circuit, the lawyer who represented the government came over to me and we had lunch and he said “we have stopped this.</text>

            <text syncTime="3313.667" offset="13254635">What the government has done is the government has assumed that he is a taxpayer and taken his money and treated him this way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3336.470" offset="13345855">Now, when you read the case, Your Honor, when you read the facts in this particular case in the appendices you find that he got stopped at the border at 2 a.m.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.111" offset="13384411">Mr. Fields, who was the District Director of Vermont was called by Customs at 2 a.m. and it is right in the appendix, Your Honor, and his deposition and testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.528" offset="13422028">And, he says he said to the Customs man “how long can you keep him?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.767" offset="13439060">The Customs man said “I can hold him for two hours but if you send somebody here, I will keep him until they get here.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3387.755" offset="13550968">The other two people disclaimed any knowledge of the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.791" offset="13563089">Laing claims knowledge of the money and ownership of the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.607" offset="13578344">The IRS then assesses, Your Honor, a $310,000 jeopardy assessment at seizure against each of the three people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.581" offset="13622230">They assessed $930,000 in taxes even though they only seized $310,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.210" offset="13652741">Your Honor, later on, we want to file a suit for a refund figuring “all right, fellows, you owe us $150,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.595" offset="13686282">Give us back half the money.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.620" offset="13694433">We file a claim for a refund, Judge, and we find out that they went even further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.997" offset="13715958">On their own initiative with no notice to anyone, the IRS is now gone and they have taken the $310,000 that they have assessed each person and they have distributed the $310,000 they seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.328" offset="13765277">They gave each person credit for $100,000 and then they, very graciously, cut the assessment from 300 to 200, but we still owe them $100,000 so we cannot bring the refund suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.800" offset="13811148">Now, we are in a position where it is our money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.345" offset="13821283">We admit it is our money and we say it is our $300.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.518" offset="13834031">We file for a refund to the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.123" offset="13844480">We say “give us back $150,000 and we will fight over whether or not I am a taxpayer,” but they will not even let us do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.627" offset="13874469">Now, Your Honor, there has been some conversation and questioning this morning concerning the fact that we have a right to a suit for refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.541" offset="13922116">But, Your Honor, there are two things involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.866" offset="13931416">The time span is a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of 18 months on a suit for refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.074" offset="13964225">For example, if the Commissioner terminates a year on January 2, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.172" offset="13984601">They terminate a tax year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.272" offset="13993064">You then have to wait until the conclusion of 1975 to file for your refund twelve months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.982" offset="14019918">You then file and the Commissioner can sit back and wait six months.</text>
