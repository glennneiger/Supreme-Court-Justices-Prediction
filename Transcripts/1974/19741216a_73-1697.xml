            <label>Mr. Kenneth L. Cornell</label>
            <text syncTime="56.356" offset="328808">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.928" offset="343124">This is an appeal by appellant, Standard Pressed Steel Co. from a final decision of the Washington Court of Appeals sustaining the assessment of the Washington Business and Occupations Acts on appellant for the privilege of engaging in wholesaling activity within the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.363" offset="408848">The Washington State Supreme Court declined review in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.173" offset="428074">The tax is measured by unapportioned gross receipts resulting from sales or products manufactured outside of the state and sold to Washington customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.109" offset="475826">The basic questions in this cause are very simply stated to, are appellant’s activities within the State of Washington sufficient to justify the imposition of the subject tax?</text>
            <text syncTime="102.096" offset="511770">And two, is the tax constitutionally defective as applied to appellant and that it is measured by gross receipts derived largely from activities occurring outside of the State of Washington?</text>
            <text syncTime="116.684" offset="570075">Appellant is a Pennsylvania corporation with facilities located in Pennsylvania and California.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.422" offset="597034">The in-state activity conducted in Washington was conducted solely by appellant’s resident employee in the State of Washington who received a salary for his services, a flat fee and worked out of a portion of one room of his home and I think since the general principles in this tax scenario are rather easy to state but I believe rather difficult to apply to particular fact situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.633" offset="709883">It might be well to review the facts briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.021" offset="727437">Mr. Martinson’s activity in the State of Washington as far as the customer is concerned brought him into context solely with Boeing qualification engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.809" offset="766621">His primary function, was to, through this contact become aware of Boeing’s possible needs for appellant’s products and to forward this information together with Boeing specifications on that product to the out-of-state offices where if the decision were made to attempt to qualify as an approved Boeing source in this product, sample pieces would be manufactured and submitted to the Boeing qualification engineers who would conduct tests and evaluate the product and if it met Boeing’s minimum specifications, appellant would be approved as a qualified source for the product and sales negotiations and sales promotion would then ensue which could possibly lead to a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.712" offset="946239">As reflected by the record, competing companies would also have qualified in many cases on particular parts and they would also be attempting to negotiate sales as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.877" offset="994931">Appellant’s resident employee is not involved in the sales negotiation or sales promotion at any time, rather he’s bypassed completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.177" offset="1036100">All of these activities take place and occur with appellant’s employees located outside of the state in Pennsylvania and California.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.287" offset="1080508">Mr. Martinson’s activities also and this is approximately 10% of his time, the duties I just mentioned consumed approximately 90% of his time.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.759" offset="1122408">The remaining portion of his time was spent in what the state has characterized as a problem-solving process.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.115" offset="1147800">In this regard, if Boeing experienced a problem in the use of one of appellant’s products, Mr. Martinson would be contacted and he in turn would forward this information to the out-of-state employees of appellant who would resolve the problem and Martinson would present the solution to the Boeing engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.736" offset="1234317">Two cases, I believe which are probably the most closely in point on this issue involve General Motors Corporation versus Washington where this Court considered the same text in Washington on different facts and Norton Company versus Department of Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.078" offset="1311640">The decision below, the court below and the state have placed heavy reliance on the General Motors decision and I believe it represents the furthest extension of the ability of a state to tax which has been sustained by this Court as regards to an unapportioned gross receipts tax and the state has characterized the basic issue before this Court as whether or not the General Motors decision can be factually distinguished on a constitutional basis from the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.153" offset="1439953">In this regard, the General Motors decision can be distinguished in several significant respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.881" offset="1470882">First and I think the most critical distinguishing factor was that General Motors maintained in Washington a very large and substantial intrastate business making sales to Washington customers on which he had voluntarily paid the Washington business and occupation tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.631" offset="1545906">Additionally, General Motors made sales on interstate commerce which the Court indicated would not be subject to the tax were it not for the presence of this intrastate business.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.806" offset="1594598">When the court held that because of the existence of the intrastate business, and because the General Motors had mingled its interstate sales with the intrastate business that the burden was on the taxpayer to show that the activities of the intrastate business were not associated with the sales on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.981" offset="1683310">And further to show that such activities were not decisive factors in establishing and maintaining the market for the interstate sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.096" offset="1715806">On the case at bar, it’s an undisputed fact and it’s clear from the record that there’s no question, there is no intrastate business per se in the same terms as General Motors making sales to Washington customers in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.993" offset="1787382">The General Motors decision is further distinguishable in that General Motors in channeling its interstate sales through the local outlet gained the advantages of a local business and the court held that interstate sales cannot be channeled through a local business so that the advantages of local commerce are obtained and still maintained immunity as to the sales on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.000" offset="1899395">In this regard, I think it should be apparent that there would be delivery in communication problems for example which a Washington customer would face in dealing with appellant that would not be present were a local business present within the State of Washington.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="465.129" offset="1963865">Mr. Cornell, incidentally, did either California or Pennsylvania tax these gross receipts?</text>

            <text syncTime="474.947" offset="2003153">Now I think that the kind of taxes is imposed by the State of Washington here because of its, I think it’s an unwise economic policy, it’s a very tough tax, very few states imposed this kind of a tax and therefore Pennsylvania and California do not impose a tax measured by gross receipts.</text>

            <text syncTime="505.287" offset="2124570">You’re not urging an apportionment here if you should lose on the basic issue?</text>

            <text syncTime="510.362" offset="2144841">Oh, yes, I am.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.513" offset="2149439">Apportionment comes up in several different ways in the Court’s language.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.120" offset="2171904">Is the state taxing activities which occur outside of the state?</text>
            <text syncTime="523.222" offset="2196250">Is the tax such that the state is exacting more than a fair return and my brief does raise the apportionment question but I think many of the principles really come down to -- can be said in many different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.021" offset="2259466">It comes down to one point, is it fair in this case and is it in violation of both due process and the Commerce Clause to impose an unapportioned gross receipts tax on a business whose -- where the gross receipts are derived largely from activities occurring outside of the state?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="559.060" stopTime="565.109">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="559.060" offset="2339610">Do you know of any fair way to apportion here if we get to that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth L. Cornell</label>
            <text syncTime="565.109" offset="2363852">That’s a difficult question.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.285" offset="2384541">For example this Court in the General Motors versus District of Columbia case, while it hesitated to get into the apportionment, I believe did mention that there are instances where payroll for example is measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.096" offset="2451728">The payroll by Washington employees would be prorated or compared with the payroll of employees outside of the state also involved in these sales and I believe there are other factors as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.675" offset="2538036">Property located within the state, although in this case, there is no property located within the state and there never was.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="614.457" offset="2561233">But isn’t that when you’re talking about you’re starting to tax the gross income and then you have to divide it up by these percentages rather than just the gross receipts of sales which concededly occur in the state?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_l_cornell" startTime="631.633" stopTime="633.193">

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="633.193" offset="2636152">Well, you were citing some cases where you say that you have to show what percentage is the payroll in the taxing jurisdiction is to the payroll elsewhere, and that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.527" offset="2681501">And I was asking you if that kind of analysis hasn’t been more commonly applied to the situation where the taxing jurisdiction seeks to tax gross income period, not simply gross sales which concededly occur within the state.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_l_cornell" startTime="660.785" stopTime="731.896">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth L. Cornell</label>
            <text syncTime="660.785" offset="2746493">Yes, I think that’s correct, I believe in the General Motors District of Columbia case, however, that all of the income they’re being taxed was resulted from sales to individuals within the District of Columbia and the Court urged apportionment in that case as well and that was the basis of the Court’s decision striking down the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.962" offset="2863208">I believe that the General Motors decision is further distinguishable in arriving at whether or not appellant’s activities in Washington are sufficient local incident in which they justify the tax and that the General Motors personnel, without going into detail engaged in substantial sales promotion and other kinds of activity in the State of Washington which are in sharp contrast to the activities of appellant in Washington and I believe it strains the imagination to equate the activities of our one employee with a bundle of corporate activities and maze of local connections which the Court felt were present in the General Motors decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="836.668" offset="3450023">I believe also that the nature of the activities conducted by appellant in Washington have to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.399" offset="3476982">For example, the General Motors personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.588" offset="3493700">They were involved very heavily and the Court made repeated reference to the intimate relationship between General Motors personnel in Washington in the Washington General Motors decision in connection with the dealer organizations within the State of Washington and pointed out that the promotional activities in that case were the nature of fostering or creating a consumer need or demand for the product and the further promotion of General Motors parts, products or services as being superior to those of competitors and best able to meet the needs of the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.249" offset="3648345">There is no similar activity which takes places in the State of Washington in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.329" offset="3668720">Rather the activity if its promotional nature, you might say that Mr. Martinson’s activities do assist in seeing that minimum standards for Boeing are met so that the possibility of sales negotiations taking place is present.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.237" offset="3760358">The Norton decision I believe is closer in point on the facts and appellant relies, I think very heavily on this case because of the similarity in the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.641" offset="3813961">The Norton company again just like the General Motors operation in Washington had present within the State of Illinois a large intrastate outlet making sales directly to Illinois consumers and on which it voluntarily paid the Illinois privilege tax measured by gross receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.973" offset="3895254">In addition, there were sales and interstate commerce which the Court indicated would not be subject to the tax were it not for the presence of the local intrastate business and again held that the taxpayer had to meet the burdens of showing that the activities of the intrastate business were not associated with the sales and interstate commerce and that such activities were not decisive factors in establishing and maintaining the market for interstate sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.616" offset="4005804">And again, since we don’t have an intrastate business here, at least the appellant does not have to meet this same kind of burden in this case, there was one class of sales and interstate commerce, however, which this Court held was exempt and these were a direct order type of situation and the Court held there that it was beyond the realm of permissible judgment to attribute the activities of the intrastate business to this type of sale and therefore these sales were so clearly in interstate commerce as to be exempt from this kind of a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.307" offset="4164629">Similarly in the present clause, all orders are the direct order type and I believe on the authority of Norton, are exempt from this kind of a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.698" offset="4218128">The state however, and the court below focused on Martinson, his presence within the state and his activities but in this regard, as I read the Norton decision, the same kinds of activities were conducted by Norton engineers in the State of Illinois and those activities were not a sufficient local incident to justify the imposition of the gross receipts tax on the direct order type of sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.070" offset="4331604">We’re told for example that the Norton engineers consulted with the prospective customers as to their needs and offered technical and engineering assistance and advice in the use of the Norton products and I believe these activities closely parallel the activities of Martinson in connection with the qualification duties and problem solving kinds of duties in the State of Washington.</text>

            <text syncTime="1084.098" offset="4439751">Martinson was not an engineer as such and -- but his activities were geared toward engineering kinds of activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.074" offset="4471620">Before he started performing his duties, appellant did give him training.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.955" offset="4495235">This is a very specialized kind of business involving the part which is used for aerospace fasteners and they’re highly machine nuts, bolts, and rivets used in the aerospace industry so it involves a very narrow area of engineering</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.016" offset="4563466">.Martinson did receive training initially. Martinson also received ongoing training.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.734" offset="4586350">He cons -- he -- his dealings with Boeing were solely with Boeing engineers, the kinds of information he forwarded onto Boeing -- or onto appellant concerned engineering kinds of things, what are the specifications of the Boeing company as to a particular product, what are they looking for here and I think would require some engineering knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.427" offset="4705050">I believe that the court below and the state perhaps have confused in-state activity with an in-state business and the two are not synonymous as pointed out by this Court in Nippert versus Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.517" offset="4769416">Interstate commerce of necessity always involves activities in more than one taxing state and you can always point to any activity as some sort of a local incident but the question is, is that local incident sufficient to justify the imposition of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.918" offset="4843081">And I believe in this case here, well, for example the solicitor case is involved activities within a state attempting to impose a tax but that activity is not a sufficient local incident on which to justify the imposition of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.405" offset="4916955">I believe the circumstances in the case at bar here present an even clearer case for exemption then would exists in the Norton decision because there is no local intrastate business present here and I think it makes the Court work somewhat easier in deciding this case than faced in the Norton decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.061" offset="4999607">Appellant would also submit that the solicitor cases support appellant’s position in this cause and in this regard, I would submit that the activities of traveling salesmen in Washington would be a far more substantial activity, far more instrumental in bringing about sales to Washington customers than the activities of Martinson in Washington.</text>

            <text syncTime="1344.149" offset="5479946">While there’s a systematic and continuous contact, we have to look at the nature of his activities and what is he doing, what does he have to offer Boeing here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1388.759" offset="5658415">Cases where this kind of a tax has been sustained involve clearly localized activity such as manufacturing where you have a sales office through which sales are channeled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.609" offset="5701778">Martinson here does not have any participation in sales.</text>

            <text syncTime="1515.315" offset="6164668">Appellant in this case would concede of course as has been stated by this Court in many different occasions that the state can exact a fair return for benefits provided and according to the level of activity occurring within the state and the same rule of course, should be applied here but in this regard, I would point out two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.585" offset="6245752">First of all, an unapportioned gross receipts tax does not make any allowance for activities occurring outside of the state and in this case, where there is a significant amount of activity occurring outside of the state from which these gross receipts are derived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.295" offset="6316596">In this case, I think by the very nature and incidence of the tax, the same tax is payable whether or not all these activities take place within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.967" offset="6355257">There are taxes if they do take place within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.474" offset="6365288">The state here is exacting more than a fair return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.018" offset="6383470">There are also always benefits provided to any business including a business operating in interstate commerce and I would submit here that the benefits given by the state are no more substantial in this case than would be supplied in the solicitor cases, perhaps General Motors versus District of Columbia, other cases involving the taxes being struck down because of a failure to properly apportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.053" offset="6499558">Evco versus Jones are very recent case decided by this Court 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.078" offset="6519724">It’s recent in the context of this kind of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.740" offset="6538324">Where the Court there in citing from J.D. Adams Manufacturing Company versus Storen presenting a quote and I believe the quote is of some benefit to this case said that, “The vice of a statute as applied to receipts from interstate sales is that the tax includes in its measure, without apportionment, receipts derived from activities in interstate commence; and that the exaction is of such a character that if lawful it may be in substance laid to the fullest extent by states in which those goods are sold” here that would be Washington “as well as those in which they are manufactured” which would be Pennsylvania or California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.707" offset="6706239">“Interstate commerce would thus be subjected to the risk of a double tax burden to which intrastate commerce is not exposed, and which the commerce clause forbids.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1678.786" offset="6818565">This case on the surface, at least, appears to involve primarily a question as to the required nexus or jurisdictional threshold necessary to sustain the Washington gross receipts tax. But a closer look shows that it involves much more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.953" offset="6891186">The nexus or jurisdictional threshold question cannot realistically be looked at in isolation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.493" offset="6921383">We must also examine the assertion that the tax here imposed discriminates against interstate commerce or exposes the taxpayers’ interstate business to multiple burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.771" offset="6970493">I pose to discuss each of these problems and the relationship between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.066" offset="6991600">Putting it in terms of your decision in General Motor, I intend to establish two propositions. First, that the imposition of our gross receipts tax in this case is consistent with the criteria established by the majority in General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.916" offset="7055026">Indeed, that it is even more soundly based than is the decision in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.051" offset="7075610">Second, I propose to show that our tax here is imposed in a manner which will satisfy the basic concerns expressed in the two dissenting opinions in the General Motors case and that the answer to those concerns is to be found in decisions of this Court dating back more than 40 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.513" offset="7157426">Standard Pressed Steel is a manufacturer and wholesaler of highly technical and specialize aerospace fasteners with plants in Pennsylvania and California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.467" offset="7201207">One of its major customers was the Boeing Company in Seattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.147" offset="7219911">The State of Washington levied a gross receipts tax on Standard’s wholesale sales to Boeing which Standard here seeks to recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.025" offset="7255437">During the early part of the period for which the taxes were levied, Standard had an office in Seattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.279" offset="7276440">That office was closed early in 1966 at which time Standard assigned one full-time employee, one Martinson to its Boeing account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.633" offset="7321893">Martinson was a Washington resident with an office in his home.</text>

            <text syncTime="1937.843" offset="7854791">Moreover, it can be calculated from the records of the two cases that Martinson’s activities resulted in a greater dollar volume of sales in Washington than the volume at least of the Chevrolet division of General Motors divided by the number of its employees in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.544" offset="7925530">Next, let’s compare Martinson’s activities with the facts in the Norton case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.354" offset="7944756">In Norton, our gross receipts tax based on that firm’s sales volume in Illinois was upheld to the extent that it was based on sales to which Norton’s in-state office was connected only by reason of having taken orders for items not in stock or for special equipment or in order to reduce freight charges by accumulating and reconsigning shipments originating out-of-state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.575" offset="8045693">These services were found to be in the Court’s own word, helpful to Norton in competing for business in Illinois, thus subjecting those sales to taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.676" offset="8094072">Only sales to Illinois customers in which Norton’s Illinois office played no part at all except for making available engineering and technical advice were exempt from taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.652" offset="8146004">Martinson’s role in Standard’s sales to Boeing was more vital to those sales than that of the Illinois office of the Norton Company in its contested sales which were held taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.385" offset="8192920">If the only concern of the Court in this case were the degree to which Martinson’s activities were decisive factors in creating Standard’s market with Boeing, the answer is so obviously in the affirmative as to render the controversy insufficiently important to have been brought before this Court at all but nevertheless, both Norton and General Motors and for that matter, the vast majority of other significant cases involving state taxation of what was asserted to be interstate commerce were decided by this Court by less than unanimous decisions, the expressed concern of the dissenters in General Motors and I suspect of members of the majority as well was the threat of multiple taxation or discrimination against interstate commerce and the consequent advisability or necessity of apportionment of a gross receipts tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.688" offset="8426141">It is perhaps sufficient to respond that appellant has utterly failed to show the existence of multiple taxation in fact in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.324" offset="8464697">Indeed, it could not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.612" offset="8473788">Standard’s interest in this case is not the avoidance of multiple taxation but the avoidance of all taxation on its Washington business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.607" offset="8509837">If Pennsylvania or California were to attempt to levy a tax on Standard’s sales transactions with Boeing and Washington State, Standard’s challenged to that attempt would be completely successful under the doctrine of Evco versus Jones, Gwin, White &amp; Prince, Freeman versus Hewitt and Adams Manufacturing versus Storen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.650" offset="8593951">In fact, as far as we can ascertain, this Court has never permitted the originating state to tax the receipts from sales to customers beyond their borders. Sales Standard here seeks to avoid paying its own way, its fair share of the state tax burden by escaping taxation measured by the proceeds of those sales in either the originating or the destination state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.248" offset="8700322">It’s appropriate, however, to go beyond the fact of the absence of multiple tax burdens and to examine the question of whether such burdens are possible in theory given as a result of the pattern of Washington gross receipts taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.982" offset="8767300">They are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.713" offset="8778271">As I have just pointed out, this Court has never permitted the state of origin to impose either a gross receipts tax or a sales tax on the proceeds of a sale to a customer beyond its borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.360" offset="8840861">Thus, there is no need for requiring apportionment on the part of the destination state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.306" offset="8868551">You consistently have preferred the destination state in your decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.076" offset="8891643">The concept of apportionment has never arisen in connection with sales or use taxes for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.891" offset="8918915">It should not by the same reason apply in connection with gross receipts taxes on sales of tangible, personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.415" offset="8953083">In concept, such taxes are identical to sales taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.518" offset="8973458">Each is measured by the proceeds from or the price of a transaction or transactions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2564.972" offset="10363277">There is the same practical equivalence whether the tax is on the selling or the buying phase of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.971" offset="10391280">Each in substance is an imposition of a tax on the transfer of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.012" offset="10411447">In light of our recent decisions, it could hardly be held that Indiana lacked constitutional authority to impose a sales tax or a use tax on these transactions but if that is true, a constitutional difference is not apparent when a gross receipts tax is utilized instead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.285" offset="10484485">In every case in this Court involving a gross receipts tax based on sales transactions for more than 40 years, the result has been totally consistent with your contemporary sales tax decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.948" offset="10543208">Both, when the gross receipts tax was upheld and when it was struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.310" offset="10564629">Perhaps it is time to recognize that the concepts behind the two taxes are identical and that for the ease of both judicial and tax administration, it is appropriate to treat them identically reaffirming International Harvester.</text>

            <text syncTime="2761.022" offset="11147473">In contrast where both of the functions confined to Washington State, only one of the two taxes would be imposed because Washington exempts from the manufacturing tax those goods which are subject to the wholesaling tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.472" offset="11209226">The vice of the system described by Mr. Justice Goldberg is best understood in terms of discrimination against interstate commerce rather than multiple taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.365" offset="11252799">The system treats the manufacturing and wholesaling processes as a single activity with the imposition of a single tax if both processes are confined to one state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.541" offset="11301491">But the system does not treat both processes as a single taxable activity if they are split between two states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.048" offset="11331584">The state statutory policy of otherwise, permissible pyramiding of the tax is not extended evenhandedly to both local and interstate business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.229" offset="11376306">But this system does not exist in fact in Washington State.</text>

            <text syncTime="2950.782" offset="11906487">To return very briefly to one of the two principle questions involved in this case, that of the necessary threshold or amount of activities within the state to justify any form of taxation whatsoever, I discussed this morning the proposition that the actual activities of Standard within the State of Washington exceeded in their relationships to its business in the state, those of either General Motors or Norton.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.696" offset="12042115">I also pointed out the very close parallel in your previous decisions between cases dealing with sales taxes and those dealing with gross receipts taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.743" offset="12082343">In that respect, the most significant case which is not cited in our brief regrettably is McGoldrick v. DuGrenier at 309 U.S. 70 in 1940 in which a sales tax was allowed to be imposed on an out-of-state company which did an exclusively interstate business in New York City through not a resident but a general agent shipping all of its goods on which the taxes were levied in interstate commerce directly to purchaser without the general agents having had anything to do with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.135" offset="12247960">Secondly, in connection with this threshold matter was the question asked of my brother about the applicability or relativity of the drummer cases such as Nippert versus Richmond and Memphis Steam Laundry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.369" offset="12308877">Whatever may have been the case in the 19th century and the early 20th century, those two cases, the only recent cases on drummers deal in one case with an out-of-state laundry which was subjected in terms to a far greater tax burden, quite specifically simply because it was from out-of-state than was its in-state competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.985" offset="12411277">In Nippert, the tax was a flat license fee in large part with no relation to the amount of business done which the Court determined would certainly hit sporadic solicitation harder than full-time resident solicitation and in addition was subject to repetition in every community in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.631" offset="12489853">Also of course, all of the solicitors in both of those cases were itinerant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.199" offset="12516185">Each of which identifies it from the case we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.683" offset="12534053">Finally, Mr. Justice Blackmun asked my brother whether there was an acceptable method of apportionment in this case and I believe the answer was none of which he knew.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.074" offset="12587656">I don’t believe that he was giving away anything in connection with that acknowledgement as that was one of the questions which very seriously troubled Mr. Justice Goldberg in his dissent from General Motors where he said that the attempt to determine the fairness of an interstate sales tax of a given percentage imposed on given activities in one state would be almost as unseemly as an attempt to determine whether that same tax was fairly apportioned in light of taxes levied on the same transactions by other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.272" offset="12728508">The infinite variety of factual configurations would readily frustrate the usual process of clarification through judicial exclusion and inclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3381.702" offset="13630151">The solution to Mr. Justice Goldberg’s dilemma is not infinitely to increase the jurisdictional threshold, not to require an apportionment which never seems to meet the actual circumstances of the case but simply to follow the conclusions to which you have previously come that the destination state will be preferred.</text>

            <text syncTime="3433.772" offset="13838503">One other point which was brought up earlier today only by inference is the proposition that one of these other states might in theory at least have an income tax and whether or not we should not be required to apportion our gross receipts tax by reason of that income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.895" offset="13918960">Now, that should be required only to the extent that every sales and gross receipts tax case which you have sustained since Berwind-White, in the McGoldrick versus Berwind-White should require similar apportionment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3504.453" offset="14121148">You have never purported to require apportionment of a sales tax since these taxes under Internal Harvester are conceptually and as a matter of fact, factually the same.</text>
