            <text syncTime="16.637" offset="66456">In the Johnson case, petitioners were charged in Mississippi courts with the illegal boycott of local businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.645" offset="98534">They sought to remove the cases under 28 U.S.C. 1443 (1) which permits removal when defendants and local criminal cases are denied or cannot enforce their rights under any federal law providing for equal civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.784" offset="163109">The District Court denied removal and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.148" offset="176588">We in turn affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.770" offset="183066">The case is controlled by our prior decision in Greenwood against Peacock.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.892" offset="207517">Here as there, there is no federal statute conferring any rights of the necessary kind that are being denied by these prosecutions in the Mississippi courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="62.292" offset="249104">Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion with whom Mr. Justice Brennan has joined.</text>
