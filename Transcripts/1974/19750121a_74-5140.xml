            <text syncTime="29.068" offset="219617">This case involves a challenge to the constitutionality of an Arizona statute, Title 13 of the Arizona revised statute Section 1580, which provides “a person who is convicted of committing any felony offense, whether federal or state, which felony offense is committed while such person is released on bail or on his own recognizance on a separate felony charge is guilty of the offense of committing a felony while released on bail or on his own recognizance and, upon conviction of such crime, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.960" offset="375202">Such penalty shall be in addition to and shall be served consecutively to any penalty imposed for the offense committed while released on bail or on his own recognizance.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.780" offset="422536">For a violation of this statute to take place three events must occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.190" offset="444165">First, a defendant must be charged with a felony, which I would call charge A, and must be released on that charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.546" offset="477602">Second, the defendant must subsequently be charged with another felony, which I'd call charge B, which is alleged to have occurred while he was released on charge A.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.376" offset="528906">And, thirdly, the defendant must be convicted of charge B.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.406" offset="548968">He need not be convicted of charge A and, in fact, it doesn't make any difference what the result on charge A is as far as Section 1580 is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.502" offset="593377">In this case, the petitioner, Michael Cassius, was arrested and charged with burglary of a motor vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.467" offset="625246">He was released on that charge and he was subsequently arrested at the scene on an apparent burglary of a business establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.993" offset="667355">He was charged with a second charge of burglary and also with a charge of committing a felony while released on recognizance under Section 1580.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.986" offset="711346">On January 4, 1973, a hearing was held in the Superior Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="354.819" offset="1522604">We have presented two questions to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.630" offset="1533889">The first is that Section 1580 violates the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment as applied to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="414.703" offset="1762200">Well, let me turn that question around if I may, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.355" offset="1788844">Part of our argument with reference to our equal protection claim is that the statute, because it, in a sense, presumes a defendant guilty of the first charge even though it need not be proven, contravenes the presumption of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.140" offset="1851956">And, if the statute were drafted, so to say, that the state must prove a conviction of both the first and the second charge, it would seem to me that there would be no infringement upon the presumption of innocence, but I'm not sure the statute as drafted does not require our conviction of the first charge and this defendant was, in fact, not convicted in the first charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.584" offset="1973687">I don't know, does that answer your question?</text>

            <text syncTime="470.037" offset="1983509">What elements does the state have to prove, Mr. Klein, in 1580?</text>

            <text syncTime="474.933" offset="2003153">That's a good question, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.051" offset="2011617">Neither of the Arizona Courts which wrote an opinion in this case indicated what the elements of a 1580 charge were.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.144" offset="2051950">In fact, the Arizona Supreme Court said that the charges of which this defendant was convicted, burglary and 1580, had no elements in common.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.123" offset="2099911">Now, the state in its petition-- in its brief has argued that there are two elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.837" offset="2126764">They say that, first of all, there is an element of conviction of a felony and, secondly, that there is an element of commission while the defendant is released on a felony charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.931" offset="2183084">And, I submit that that statement is also ambiguous in terms of determining what the elements are.</text>

            <text syncTime="533.758" offset="2238360">The proof was that the Court was asked to take judicial notice of the fact that burglary was a felony and that the defendant had entered a plea of guilty to burglary, and it was stipulated that the defendant had been charged previously and had been released on that charge and had remained released during the period of time in which the second burglary charge was alleged to have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.011" offset="2343372">And, the only reason there was need for that stipulation was that the Justice of the Peace who released the defendant had not issued an order or entered one into the record, and so the Court couldn't take judicial notice about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="605.529" offset="2525497">This Court has said, for example, that the presumption of innocence would be meaningless if defendants could not be released prior to their trial because if they could not, they would be punished before they were tried.</text>

            <text syncTime="1750.025" offset="7103509">Obviously, from the reading of the transcript in this case from the very beginning, it appeared as though there was a plea bargain struck and, conceivably, there could be more to the plea bargain and what we can piece together here because, at the very end, we also find out that Mr. Cassius did work with the police and his estimation cleared up 15 burglary cases, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.484" offset="7181354">So, conceivably, there was more to the plea bargain but, in direct answer to your question and perhaps a little of my own there, I do not believe that wherever this statute has been used, it has been used as something to plea bargain to or down from. Other than Maricopa and Pima, I have not been able to find, I believe, any instance of where this statute has been used.</text>

            <text syncTime="2197.893" offset="8894986">What I'm talking about is that second burglary and the 1580.</text>

            <text syncTime="2236.993" offset="9051303">Therefore, they are two offenses and there may be two punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.264" offset="9076381">Now, Mr. Klein has said-- he said in his reply brief, which I got shortly before I came here, that there are no cases and nowhere in the State of Arizona is there anything that will tell us what the elements of a 1580 crime are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.106" offset="9147747">That's not quite right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.429" offset="9153076">There is a statement, and I believe they laid out in the Court of Appeals opinion-- the Arizona Court of Appeals, what one element is and what the other element is of a 1580 violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.337" offset="9208769">There are no other cases on 1580 in the State of Arizona that either of us have been able to find, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.436" offset="9237086">However, the Court of Appeals opinion does say that the elements of that crime are conviction of a felony and that felony being committed while the person was on bail or OR.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.667" offset="9306049">And, I believe, over and above, whether there are any cases delineating what those elements are, the statute itself is quite clear as to what the elements are that are required to be proved when a prosecutor goes to Court, and I don't think there's any doubt when you read that statute it says there has to be a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.818" offset="9394657">The petitioner would say that that is not an element, but that is simply a standard of proof that has been inserted into the statute by the legislature, but there is no indication of that whatsoever, other than perhaps someone believing that.</text>
