            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="16.817" offset="67187">For the first case, Ellis against Dyson comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.502" offset="97907">The petitioners here were convicted and fined by the Municipal Court of the City of Dallas on their pleas of nolo contendere for violating the Dallas loitering ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.753" offset="150988">They did not seek a trial de novo in the County Court as they were entitled to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.686" offset="174707">Instead they brought the present action in the federal court challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance and seeking declaratory and other relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.902" offset="211592">The federal court dismissed the action and held that such relief against future state criminal prosecutions was not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.379" offset="241476">In so doing, it relied upon a decision of the Fifth Circuit, the District Court's controlling court.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.389" offset="265509">Word was held that the principles of Younger against Harris applied where a state criminal prosecution was merely threatened. The Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.678" offset="310648">The Fifth Circuit's opinion on which the District Court had relied was subsequently reversed in our case entitled Steffel against Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.837" offset="351295">We there held that federal declaratory relief was not precluded when a state prosecution based upon an assertedly unconstitutional state statute had been threatened but was not pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.411" offset="401554">As a consequence, we reversed the Court of Appeals' judgment and remand the case to the District Court for reconsideration on the light of Steffel as to whether there is a genuine threat of prosecution here and as to the relationship between the past prosecution of the petitioners and the alleged threat of future prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.412" offset="481593">I'm authorized to say that Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.617" offset="502387">Mr. Justice White has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.789" offset="523076">And Mr. Justice Powell has filed a dissenting opinion which Mr. Justice Stewart has joined and in which the Chief Justice has joined in part.</text>
