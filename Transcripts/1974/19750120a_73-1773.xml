            <text syncTime="53.614" offset="317837">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.189" offset="340093">The question presented by the case is whether a requirement of a collective bargaining agreement that an employee work not less than 25 weeks in the prior year to receive a vacation can be used to prevent a returning veteran from receiving a vacation in the year of his return and in the year after his return.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.362" offset="444792">The Court of Appeals held that the company could deny vacations to the veteran for failure to meet this 25-work week requirement, it's our position that this interpretation keeps a veteran from returning to his employment without loss of seniority status or pay and it's in contravention of 50 U.S.C. 459, the Selective Service Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="833.942" offset="3439156">That is not the Government's theory for this reason and in the Accardi case.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.331" offset="3468727">This Court pointed that in a -- in a scheme for a severance pay that was based on years of service in the year of service and the year of service for so many months of service and the month of service was a month in which so many days of service that it could work out where a person that only had 10 or 12 days of service and it would still be counted as a year of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.085" offset="3579695">Now, the Court rejected arguments in that case that that was very untypical sort of thing that a man would be fired if he was working that little and the Court concentrated on the proposition that that the scheme itself shows that that's not a one-to-one or not a close ratio at all between the amount of vacation and the hours worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.833" offset="3686693">Now, I think the facts of this case and as their worksheets in the appendix that will show this would show that the 25 weeks was nowhere near a typical work year that the 47 weeks or 50 weeks was much closer to it but we don't suggest that the Court should get into that in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.946" offset="3775195">One of the problems in this kind of case that the total amount of money that you're talking about is usually small in any individual case and that the companies need some fairly certain way of determining whether a vacation benefit is old or not and so do the employees and it's better to seek a solution that can be easily applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1198.018" offset="4895431">Well, when, I say we, what I mean is I really have to mean to two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.486" offset="4925315">One is that the Department of Justice represents the individual Earl Foster, out there right now and we argue the case for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.371" offset="4972857">When I say we, we also we also mean the Department of Labor and the Justice Department support the position that we have taken in this -- in this brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.614" offset="5037850">I haven't gotten to talk much about the cases but there are two cases it seem to me you are in control of this language to the statute and two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.866" offset="5094797">Language to the statute is that a veteran should be restored in such manner as to give him such status in his employment as he would he have enjoyed if he had continued in such employment continuously from the time of his entering the armed forces until the time of his restoration to such employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.805" offset="5174627">That was an Act in 1948 that really codifying this Court's decision, perhaps codifying and expanding this Court's decision in the case called Fishgold but the Court has had two cases on questions similar to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.804" offset="5250591">The big issue for a while prior to the Accardi case among people who dealt with this problem was whether vacation benefits severance pay pensions counted as questions of seniority and status of whether they on the other hand counted as insurance or other benefits which would be governed by the contract provisions for people on leaves of absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.124" offset="5375875">In Accardi, the Court for -- the Court defined the insurance or other benefits clause and it said that that was something in addition to the seniority clause that it didn't keep severance pay from being seniority and that it applied to benefits the serviceman might get while he's in the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.709" offset="5478170">In other words, that if an employee on leave of absence could still go to the railroad hospital or his wife could still go to the railroad hospital, the insurance and other benefits clause would assure that his wife could still go there even if he was in the service and the Court very specifically ruled on or discussed that the insurance and other benefit clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.688" offset="5586108">Then prior to the Accardi decision, in the Magma Copper case that this situation, employees under -- who had been denied both vacation pay and holiday pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.198" offset="5656116">In the vacation pay, they were denied it because -- although they had satisfied their work requirement of 75% of the available shifts, they were not present at the plant on the last day of the year because they were in the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.810" offset="5726647">As to holiday pays, when they come back from the military, just think about this when they'd come back from the military, this were then the Vietnam War.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.435" offset="5773145">They were denied holiday pay for Fourth of July and for Independence Day though everyone else got it because they hadn't satisfied a three-month requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.258" offset="5816404">They had not been on the payroll three months when they came back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.800" offset="5834585">Now, the Ninth Circuit upheld that and said the company could do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.125" offset="5851826">It could apply its contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.702" offset="5866141">Then the Accardi case was decided and the Ninth Circuit had the case back again on rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.117" offset="5891845">They reaffirmed their prior decision with one judge dissenting, saying, “We can't do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.304" offset="5920580">This is not what other benefits means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.431" offset="5929148">This is part of seniority see the Accardi case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.344" offset="5948792">The veterans petitioned this Court and the Court granted writ of certiorari and the Court summarily reversed the Ninth Circuit with an opinion that just said reversed, see Accardi with the citation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.153" offset="6027995">There was a dissent in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.269" offset="6036459">Justice Stewart -- Justice Douglas wrote the dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.877" offset="6050879">Justice Stewart and Justice Harlan joined in the dissent and in the dissent, they would have made a distinction between the amount of vacation or holiday pay that a person could get and the entitlement to it and would have said that the question of the entitlement to it is not a question of seniority and is something that would have to be governed by the contract but that's the position that the Court did not take and that's the subversive opinion said in an earlier case and as a result of that case too, we think it's even clearer that in this situation that -- that the entitlement should not be governed by the contract but should be a question of seniority that the serviceman has a right to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.298" offset="6292564">Now, I want to answer one question raised by the respondents in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.955" offset="6315238">They say that as a matter of sort of legal principle that a vacation -- that vacation pay is a part of wages paid, of salary and that therefore it has to be something other than seniority, that you can't give a man a salary for the time that he didn't worked and they cite a number of cases and arbitration decisions but those cases make a different point as we read and that is in the 1930's, the Court sometime said that vacation is just a gratuity and that the management can do it at once with it and in a number of cases, arbitrators in courts held that vacations are not just questions of gratuity that there are things bargained for and in that sense, they say, that there are function of wages but there certainly was no attempt in those cases to answer the kinds of questions that are set forth here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2223.138" offset="8995924">This provision is negotiated into a collective bargaining agreement by a union to protect people who for some reason may be ill during the course of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.753" offset="9042422">They say, “Gee!</text>

            <text syncTime="2304.757" offset="9322350">Now, to answer some other questions that were raised in part of my argument, the question here is more than the $377.92 involved which are the vacation entitlements in 1967 and the vacation entitlements in 1968 which by the way Your Honors, in 1967, he became entitled to another days vacation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.660" offset="9462053">He would -- his vacation entitlement in 1967 is 64 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.080" offset="9483682">His vacation entitlement in 1968 is 72 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.379" offset="9500923">We recognized that when he got his vacation in 1970 and we gave him credit for his military service as far as the length of his vacation goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.166" offset="9548048">That is not at issue here and we did recognize that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.461" offset="9565184">We're talking about the entitlement to a vacation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.960" offset="9587231">Now, let me point out the economic significance of finding the benefit as the Government would argue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.204" offset="9628191">We are dealing with a statute that has no statute limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.809" offset="9658598">We're dealing with a statute that is only detriment to filing suit is the doctrine of laches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.160" offset="9683989">At least in Pennsylvania and as recognized by the Third Circuit, laches doesn't come into effect into a man who has unknown right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.694" offset="9726098">This statute has not been significantly amended since its enactment in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.969" offset="9751280">So theoretically, you'll find for the Government every employee at Dravo who has been in the military service can file a suit to recover back vacation pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="3414.079" offset="13759718">We're giving him all the credit and to point out further that a vacation is an earned benefit under the Dravo contract, I would point out that in Article IV, Section 3 as cited at my brief, a person at Dravo who works considerably more overtime as to say regularly six days a week receives more vacation than the person who doesn't work those hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.373" offset="13908825">So, there is a relationship between the amount of time worked and the amount of vacation you get and that you get more vacation if you worked longer hours and more overtime.</text>

            <text syncTime="3481.839" offset="14030764">What happened in the Accardi decision was the Pennsylvania Railroad attempted to abolish the position of firemen on new diesel tugs back in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.905" offset="14083009">A strike ensued, the firemen went on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.582" offset="14105684">The intra-strike was finally settled in 1960 with an agreement that the position of firemen was abolished.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.711" offset="14150196">However, they would remain on the payroll, those firemen who had 20 years or more seniority and they remained on the work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.873" offset="14198888">The other part of the agreement paid severance pay to those employees who had less than 20 years seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.410" offset="14237027">The severance pay was paid on a theory of the number of years of compensated service you had with the Pennsylvania Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.960" offset="14291257">The Pennsylvania Railroad being wrong again argued that this was an earned benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.599" offset="14325739">This Court correctly saw it wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.583" offset="14333680">It couldn't be an earned benefit because the people who works severed would never ever get the benefit and everybody who was discharged got some benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.184" offset="14404106">The only thing they were arguing about was the amount of the benefit and that's exactly like our vacation policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.717" offset="14430229">The amount is not in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.160" offset="14440051">It is a prerequisite of seniority and the entire agreement was the severance pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.169" offset="14468054">There was no full collective bargaining agreement and the Third Circuit in this case reviewed the entire contract and came to the conclusion that vacations at Dravo are an earned benefit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3618.707" offset="14578186">There was a dissent in that case written by Justice Douglas on behalf of you, Justice Stewart and the late Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.273" offset="14620505">In that case though, Eagar had worked the amount of time that was necessary to receive the benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.104" offset="14659793">He had worked 75% of the hours in the week before he entered the military service and the year before he entered the military service.</text>
