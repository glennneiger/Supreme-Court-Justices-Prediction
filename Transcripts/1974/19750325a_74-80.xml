            <text syncTime="24.744" offset="202376">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.724" offset="218258">This case comes before this Court on a petition and cross petition for certiorari, to review a judgment rendered by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit sitting en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.195" offset="272175">That judgment reversed an order entered by the United States District Court, dismissing respondent's complain pursuant to Rule 12 (b) (6) and denying his application for preliminary injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.444" offset="337168">At issue here is the propriety of Federal intervention in an ongoing state criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.275" offset="364440">More specifically the question to be resolved, is whether the New Jersey Supreme Court's conference with the respondent, which allegedly had the affect of coercing to testify before the state grand jury, constituted such extraordinary circumstances as to compel Federal intervention in the resulting, disrupting of legitimate state criminal processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.600" offset="465795">For the purpose of this argument, the material facts are not in dispute and are essentially a matter of public record.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.368" offset="496828">Respondent, a member of the New Jersey Bar and a former municipal court judge alleged in a verified complaint filed under the Civil Rights Act, that he had been subpoenaed to appear before the State grand jury on October 18, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.415" offset="573001">Pursuant to that subpoena, respondent appeared and was then advised that he was a target of the grand jury's investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.077" offset="599646">Armed with that information and being fully apprised of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, the respondent refused to enter the grand jury room.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.850" offset="634755">He was then brought before a Superior Court judge, who following argument in open court ordered him to appear in the grand jury room and to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege if that was his desire.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.656" offset="690030">The respondent then entered the grand jury room and refused to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.095" offset="715734">This matter then came to the attention of the Supreme Court of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.376" offset="732871">In the interim however it had become apparent that the grand jury's inquiry concerned other matters in which the respondent was allegedly involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.972" offset="767248">He was therefore re-subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury on November 8, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.512" offset="793370">The Supreme Court of New Jersey having scheduled oral arguments on that date, requested the presence of Judge Helfant and Judge Moore who was also implicated in the criminal scheme at his private conference room.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.526" offset="853452">The object of that conference was to determine whether removal or disciplinary proceedings were to be commenced against either or both judges.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.019" offset="1127424">Both Judge Moore who had previously waived this Fifth Amendment privilege and testified freely before the grand jury, and Judge Hoffman who as I have noted had refused, appeared as requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.181" offset="1176116">Both judges agreed not to sit pending resolution of the grand jury's investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.886" offset="1210911">Respondent's complaint alleged that the affect of this conference on him was to harass him to before the State grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.130" offset="1251871">All parties agree that his testimony was wholly exculpatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.349" offset="1268799">Nevertheless the grand jury returned an indictment, charging him with substantive offenses and with four counts of false swearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.569" offset="1305684">Based upon these allegations, respondent sought an injunction in the United States District Court, adjoining prosecution of the state charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.708" offset="1342255">Following an evidentiary hearing, the District Court dismissed respondent's complaint pursuant to Rule 12 (b) (6) and denied his application for a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.656" offset="1381961">Specifically, the Court concluded that the complaint was barren of anything which would indicate bad faith or harassment on the part of New Jersey's prosecutorial authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.750" offset="1422399">So too, the District Court was unwilling to presume that the entire state judicial system would be innocuously infected by virtue of the Supreme Court's involvement in the aftereffects of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.258" offset="1468374">A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals subsequently reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.399" offset="1484988">Following re-argument, the Court of Appeals in an en banc decision ordered an evidentiary hearing to determine whether respondents were not to testify had been overborne and further ordered findings of facts and conclusions in the form of a declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.853" offset="1558758">We submit that the Court of Appeals en banc decision calling for a declaratory relief ignored time-honored principles of federalism and comity as annunciated by this Court in Younger against Harris and Samuels against Mackell.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.541" offset="1621556">We recognize of course at the outset, that for the purpose of this argument, all reasonable and legitimate inferences must be assumed in favor of the respondent.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.771" offset="2254451">I might point out at this point that the purpose of an injunction and indeed declaratory relief as well is to prevent a future violation of the law not to rectify a wrong already done.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.027" offset="2299486">We submit that under the facts that presently exist, respondent's complaint simply does not satisfy the great and immediate harm requirement annunciated by this Court in Younger against Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.808" offset="2342640">When viewed within the factual context as it presently exists, it's quite clear that respondent's allegations amount to nothing more than a mere academic exercise and are conceivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.776" offset="2386526">Plainly there was nothing anomalous in the Supreme Court's conference with Judge Helfant.</text>

            <label>Mr. David S. Baime</label>
            <text syncTime="758.596" offset="3137808">Yes and with regard to that we would point out that the coercion issue is again wholly irreverent to the criminal proceedings pending against the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.584" offset="3185664">Simply stated, there is no reason to assume even giving the fact that there is wholesale contamination in the state judiciary that any member of that judicial system will ever be confronted with the issue of having to determine whether the Supreme Court in fact, coerced this respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.272" offset="3256508">The reason I think is quite obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.678" offset="3266121">With respect to the false swearing charges, it's clear that the Fifth Amendment privilege does not deal a witness who was compelled to testify with the license to commit perjury with impunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.210" offset="3312201">Rather this Court has repeatedly construed the Fifth Amendment is implying only to evidence of past criminal transgressions, beginning with such cases as Glickstien against United States, and going through Dennis against United States, Bryson against United States and only recently, United States against Knox, this Court has made it abundantly clear that a witness, even compelled to testify may not take the law in his own hands and violate his oath with impunity and that's what we alleged that this witness did.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.781" offset="3430484">Therefore, the fact that -- or the question of coercion is wholly irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.795" offset="3450546">Even assuming coercion to false swearing charges will not be vitiated, the same principles apply with equal force when considering the efficacy of that part of the indictment charging the respondent with substantive crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.279" offset="3504462">I should point out that those crimes are conspiracy to obstruct justice, obstruction of justice in compounding a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.264" offset="3532466">This Court has often upheld the principle that reception before a grand jury of even unconstitutionally obtained evidence, does not serve to vitiate substantive charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.218" offset="3584293">Rather, the remedy under those circumstances is to suppress the use in fruits of that testimony so that the testimony may not be used at the defendant's criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.843" offset="3630791">Again, I submit that U.S. -- United States against Blue is directly dispositive of the issue there, specifically the injunction with rather the indictment with regard to the substantive counts is insulated from attack upon the ground that respondent's grand jury testimony was unconstitutionally obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.015" offset="3715427">And therefore, it's quite clear that an injunction which would be tantamount to dismissal of these charges would be most inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.177" offset="3748028">Rather the only fear that respondent has is that at some future point based on a hypothetical series of events which would in all likelihood will never occur, the state for some reason which I cannot fathom will utilize his grand jury testimony against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.927" offset="3815111">And we've pointed out that his grand jury testimony being wholly exculpatory would not serve as a declaration against penal interest under New Jersey's evidentiary law, nor would it serve as an admission against interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.443" offset="3869132">And I refer also to the fact that we made a binding stipulation before the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that we do not intend to introduce the respondent's grand jury testimony against him, other than of course, with respect to the crime of false swearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.280" offset="3940498">Again, I pointed out in my brief that concession or that stipulation is not gendered by an overwhelming feeling of actualism and the point I am making again is that the respondent's grand jury testimony in this case was wholly exculpatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.643" offset="4001938">Therefore, the prospect that there will be constitutional injury in this case, is based on pure speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.017" offset="4039450">It's wholly conjectural and certainly under these circumstances, the respondents complaint does not satisfy the great and immediate harm requirement set forth in Younger against Harris.</text>

            <text syncTime="1014.446" offset="4161181">I would point out further that here the declaratory judgment would certainly be as abrasive as an injunction for the reasons pointed out in Steffel against Thompson, Samuels against Mackell and the Mr. Justice Brennan's conquering or I should say separate opinion in Perez against Ledesma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.566" offset="4225651">Firstly, there is a question under Section 2102, whether an injunction could be issued to enforce declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.387" offset="4260968">I know your own views on that issue, but of course, there is some disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.058" offset="4279568">Secondly, a declaratory judgment might well have some res judicata effect, some binding effect upon the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.790" offset="4310497">Thirdly, assuming that the declaratory judgment would not be binding on the state courts that solely means that a declaratory judgment here would encourage duplication of legal proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1076.839" offset="4410702">I just -- I do think that the judges, lawyers and prosecutors are guided not only by the letter of laws enunciated by this Court in the Court of Appeals but the spirit as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.053" offset="4451558">And again we have submitted that the Younger's introduction in based on something more than a technical rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.520" offset="4477471">It's based on hundreds of years of federalism and comity and those principles have been reaffirmed time and time again by this Court only recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.341" offset="4516760">This Court had a case, I believe this last week to come down with the Huffman against Pursue decision which again eludes to the fact that we simply cannot assume that members of a state judicial system will fail or refuse to obey the law they are bound to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.549" offset="4581543">That is the presumption upon which respondent's complaint rests and we submit that it's wholly conjectural and incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.233" offset="4632325">In conclusion, I would point out that the issue here is not whether a citizen is to be denied access to the Federal Courts for disposition of his constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.736" offset="4686346">We have maintained throughout these proceedings that Habeas Corpus and Certiorari proceedings provide a litigant with proper remedies for significant constitutional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.113" offset="4747786">Those remedies do not call for massive disruption and dislocation of legitimate state criminal processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.523" offset="4777462">At issue here rather is the state sovereign power or right to try and accuse without delay, we contend that a balancing of competing values, in this case, clearly calls for the application of the abstention doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.209" offset="4848201">We therefore, accordingly urge the reversal of the Court of Appeals' opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1197.708" offset="4894177">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.125" offset="4907865">I think initially, I should point out the procedural context in which this case comes before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.111" offset="4935868">In the Federal District Court, the New Jersey Supreme Court, and the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General, labeled as the defendants were successful in making a motion under Federal Rule 12 (b) (6) and obtained a dismissal of the complaint, for failure to state a cause for which relief could be granted and also at the same time, were able to block the application for preliminary restrain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.004" offset="5035342">At this juncture the procedure, the plaintiff is entitled, the plaintiff Judge Helfant is entitled to have all the facts that he has established regarded as true, together with the reasonable inferences that flow there from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.224" offset="5092289">Now, the defendants in this case have not answered the complaint, they have not filed an affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.017" offset="5111411">They have not introduced one iota of testimony before the Federal Court and their defense in this case is essentially ingenious argument, which is not based on the record and dealing with the record, we contend that the facts that have been established in that record meet the requisites of equity intervention in a pending state criminal proceeding that there is irreparable damage that is great and immediate, that this case falls within the extraordinary circumstances doctrine of Younger v. Harris, the unusual circumstances doctrine of Steffel v. Thompson; the extremely rare case referred to by Chief Justice Burger in his concurring opinion in Allee v. Medrano and that it meets the bad faith and harassment requirements so that right across the board, the plaintiff is entitled to injunctive relief in this pending state criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.486" offset="5321331">Now the facts, as I heard them from my opponent, are not the facts that are -- the complete facts that are in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.642" offset="5349961">Initially to start with, while the plaintiff was called before the state grand jury, he not only refused to go before the state grand jury, but he had a hearing before a Trial Court, which ordered him to appear before the state grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.741" offset="5406386">He then attempted to appeal and over the telephone, actually appealed this decision to the Appellate Division, which is the immediate appeals tribunal in the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.866" offset="5442853">He was unsuccessful in that joint telephone call with the Attorney General, and he attempted to contact the Supreme Court, and he was unable to do so, and he finally had to go before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.007" offset="5487365">In other words, he did everything humanly possible to resort to his Fifth Amendment privilege and to keep from testifying.</text>

            <text syncTime="2376.796" offset="9610533">Now, I say this that I certainly feel that we should be allowed to build a full record before the Federal District Court to determine whether this is an extraordinary situation, where there is autocracy of remedy, where there is a irreparable harm, because to say that a new court can be -- the harm has been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.862" offset="9690781">The harm has been done, he has been deprived, has been coerced out of a constitutional right with certain consequences.</text>

            <text syncTime="2416.914" offset="9771029">Once you've turn your lethal weapons on him and to say we are going to treat you afterwards is not an answer to a deprivation of the constitutional right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2452.845" offset="9914702">But what they are in effect saying is to the Federal District Court you give a declaratory judgment on the issue of coercion after you had determined whether or not there is coercion, then the Supreme Court would be relieved of that embarrassment and we can then send this case back to the New Jersey court system to complete the criminal proceedings and I don't think a piecemeal approach and there are other issues in this case besides coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.219" offset="10004250">There is issues of bad faith, there is issues of whether or not this is an extraordinary case, an extremely rare case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.645" offset="10029955">There is issues of -- and I don't think the exception we're concerned with if this Court please is an extremely narrow one.</text>

            <text syncTime="2493.536" offset="10077497">Our research has failed to disclose that anything like this has ever happened before and certainly if this Court acts with vigor and acts the way we respectfully requested, that will never happened again and that the rights of litigants in state criminal courts will beyond approach not only by errant prosecutors, not only by overzealous law enforcement officers lead by Supreme Court Judges who can also err.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.301" offset="10176554">And I might say this that if I seemed too brash, I would like to say that my father was a member of this Court and my brother was a member of the court system at the State of New Jersey and it has been reluctantly and slowly I have come to the conclusions I have come to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.094" offset="10235800">I was brought up to respect and revere the court system at the state of New Jersey.</text>

            <text syncTime="2549.543" offset="10301524">I am the one who has made this actions before the trial court before the Appellate division, before the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.165" offset="10323989">We've attempted to exhaust the remedies there and I think that this is a traditional case and that there can be no distinguishment between the false swearing and the substantive charges, because we are right back again to the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.262" offset="10380413">And just as -- for instance, one of the false swearing charges is whether or not he is signed the dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.142" offset="10407894">Now the Supreme Court has already examined that complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="2651.554" offset="10709556">This is the nature of the beast, but what is important is that there be a vindication of a substantial constitutional right in the state court and up to now we have not been able to vindicate that right, we have not even been able to get a hearing, not even an inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.629" offset="10773922">The courts have even refused to give us an inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2727.067" offset="11011636">I would like to answer at least one question that was propounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.358" offset="11032848">In the state of New Jersey, the state of Supreme Court in State against Falco specifically is held that the coercion defense is not available with respect to a charge of false swearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.801" offset="11082585">Specifically, I refer the court to State against Falco which is cited at page 53 and 56 my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.202" offset="11116231">Secondly, I would just like to reaffirm the principle that what respondent seeks here is immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.639" offset="11153951">He can vindicate his rights, if there was a constitutional violation by an action for damages under the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.892" offset="11186970">There are other remedies available as well as it was pointed out in a O'Shea against Littleton, specifically there are even criminal penalties which apply where there has been gross misconduct of a judge or a prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.658" offset="11246007">Rather the respondent here is seeking an injunction which looks to the future and again we submit that the prospect of harm occurring or even assuming the truth of the allegations in the complaint in the inferences which we feel cannot be drawn, there is no likelihood of recurrence or repeat of this type of situation in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.165" offset="11347989">Again, we submit that respondent's allegations as set forth in the complaint are nothing more than a mere academic exercise, the conceivable and the state should be permitted to try the case, and respondent's remedy assuming conviction is based on certiorari to this Court or habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.116" offset="11419878">Thank you.</text>
