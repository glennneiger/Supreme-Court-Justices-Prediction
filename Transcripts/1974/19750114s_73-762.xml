            <text syncTime="24.588" offset="98325">In Sosna, the State of Iowa enacted a statute under which only persons who have resided in the state for one year may file a petition for divorce in Iowa's courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.461" offset="153809">Appellant Sosna who had resided in Iowa for only a month unsuccessfully sought to obtain a divorce in the Iowa state court and thereafter she filed a class action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa challenging the constitutionality of the Iowa residency requirement for divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.460" offset="245760">A three-judge District Court was convened and upheld this constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.564" offset="274181">We noted probable jurisdiction and by the time we heard oral argument, appellant Sosna had resided in Iowa for the requisite one year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.613" offset="314410">And we were informed by counsel that she had also obtained a divorce in another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.940" offset="339696">But since appellant Sosna brought a properly certified class action, we hold the case is not moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.738" offset="366864">While her dispute has been resolved, she represents a class with a continuing controversy that would escape review by any single challenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.826" offset="407301">We are satisfied that appellant adequately represents the members of the class and at the merits of her case are therefore properly before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.040" offset="444082">On the merits we hold that the Iowa statute is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.036" offset="460069">It furthers the state's quite legitimate interest in protecting its decrees against collateral attack and assures that those persons seeking to invoke the powers of the state courts have a reasonable attachment to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.833" offset="515239">We therefore affirm the judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.350" offset="529345">Mr. Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.685" offset="542720">Mr. Justice Marshall joined by Mr. Justice Brennan has also filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
