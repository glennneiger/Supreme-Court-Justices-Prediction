            <text syncTime="20.470" offset="185240">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.002" offset="195375">When the Court adjourned yesterday, I have set forth the facts of this case which are essentially that Internal Revenue Service summons was served upon respondent an officer of the bank in order to determine the identity of the depositor or transferor of some 400 $100 bills that were in seriously deteriorated condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.152" offset="295999">Summons was drawn in the matter of the tax liability of “John Doe” because the identity of the depositor was what the Internal Revenue Service wanted to ascertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.597" offset="337795">Now, respondent refused to comply and after a hearing held in the United States District Court brought by the Government</text>
            <text syncTime="66.726" offset="370291">.The District Court narrowed the summons to require production of all cash deposit tickets equaling $20,000 during a one month period, October 16, 1970 to November 16, 1970 since the Federal Reserve Bank in Cleve -- in Cincinnati had received this cash on November 6 by ticket and 10 or 15 days later and also --</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="94.347" offset="480737">You said deposit tickets equaling $20,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.967" offset="499231">Do you mean deposit the tickets in which the single amount of $20,000 would have been indicated as having been deposited?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="105.813" offset="526608">Yes, that was one part of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.562" offset="533608">The second part of the order involved the production of the deposit tickets of cash equal to an excessive $5,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.264" offset="576449">The District Court felt that in that way by narrowing the summons in that regard the identity of the depositor could be ascertained with the minimum of disruption to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.440" offset="629112">Now, respondent appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which reversed and it’s the correctness of that statutory ruling which is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.934" offset="671117">The Court of Appeals held that the Internal Revenue Service has no statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.211" offset="692224">The issue of summons before it has discovered the identity of the particular person it wishes to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.253" offset="724407">I think before I discussed the statutes in some detail, I think it’s important to state at the outset what this case does not involve.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.619" offset="761814">This case does not involve any application of a constitutional protection to the production of records by the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.283" offset="788459">I think that the Court’s decision last term in California Bankers Association has made clear that there is no claim of privilege against self-incrimination which would be applicable by the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.534" offset="837465">Its officers or in behalf of these unknown taxpayers who may be incriminated by the records sought by the summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.819" offset="870693">These are third party records which are not protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.757" offset="886366">So the case therefore presents a statutory question, the narrow focus of which is upon two provisions of the Internal Revenue Code which are presently set forth at Section 7601 and Section 7602 of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.770" offset="946448">There set forth on pages 2 and 3 --</text>

            <text syncTime="216.987" offset="971316">There set forth in pages 2 and 3 of our brief under the caption statutes involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.806" offset="1002559">Now, these statutes, we submit our cast in the broadest possible terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.822" offset="1026696">Section 7601 admonishes the Secretary of the Treasury has delegate here the Commission of Internal Revenue to proceed from time to time through each Internal Revenue District and inquire after and concerning all persons therein who be may be liable to pay any Internal Revenue tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.712" offset="1110183">Section 7602, which affords the service to summons power designed to implement this canvass power in Section 7601 also is cast in broad terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.453" offset="1165145">And that these two statutes which the Court recognized in the Donaldson case to be both closely related and rooted in statutes enacted more than a century ago which we believe provide the statutory power for the Internal Revenue Service.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.206" offset="1340165">It can be viewed by looking at these statutes in Danville.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="326.688" offset="1410173">If I may, I would like to consider in detail the terminology of these statutes which I think are critical to a resolution of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.542" offset="1449566">As I said, Section 7601 talks about a canvass power of the Internal Revenue Service to proceed from time to time and it talks about inquiring after and concerning all persons in our view a broad phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.013" offset="1511424">Now, when you get the answer of Section 7602, the statute talks about four purposes for which a summons like this can be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.645" offset="1553951">It talks about the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any return for making a return where none has been made for determining the liability of any person for any Internal Revenue tax or collecting any such liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.929" offset="1615078">Now, we think that the summons in this case plainly falls within the statutory purposes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="384.396" stopTime="394.205">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="384.396" offset="1640991">You may have answered Mr. Justice Stewart on this and if so I missed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.040" offset="1659486">If you didn’t have 7601 would 7602 be enough to take care of your case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="394.205" stopTime="558.976">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="394.205" offset="1680175">We believe it would because we think that the summons that was issued in this case falls within the statutory purpose of Section 7602 alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.947" offset="1735137">When we’re talking about the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any return making a return where none has been made etcetera, etcetera, we think that if the Internal Revenue Service -- the proper way to view do this case is as the initiation of a process and which these statutory purposes are fully applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.109" offset="1823848">In this particular case, the Internal Revenue Service does not know the identity of this depositor whose transactions are indeed suspicious.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.202" offset="1856136">I think it’s undisputed that these transactions are suspicious and presumably once the identity is ascertained via the summons power.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.252" offset="1896364">Then this Internal Revenue Service will go on to ascertain the correctness of the depositor’s return, make a return if none had been made, determine his liability under the third purpose and so forth and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.865" offset="1946833">In fact, the third purpose of the statute determining the liability of any person for any Internal Revenue tax, we think it’s sufficiently broad enough to cover this case because what we’re talking about here is the statute does not confine itself in the way that the Court of Appeals confined it to a determination of the tax liability of unidentified person rather it talks about the liability of any person for any Internal Revenue tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.738" offset="2058324">And we think that what Congress has done here is to accord the Internal Revenue Service, the power to answer what we think is the basic fundamental question in the enforcement of any law.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.943" offset="2107120">That is who is responsible, who has breached his responsibility under the law in the context of the revenue statutes it simply a question of who has not fulfilled his civil tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.253" offset="2160410">That’s what's involved here and we think the statute covers it.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.591" offset="2177755">Now, what the Court said that is the Court of Appeals is that there is no particular taxpayer under investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.810" offset="2210565">Now, in our view that is not correct in any sense that is meaningful when one considers the services statutory responsibility to ascertain and to go through the internal revenue districts and to determine the liability of any person.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.278" offset="2280469">It is only correct in the sense which we think is a trivial sense that the identity of the person has not been ascertained this yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.140" offset="2315891">But there is no doubt in this case that there is a particularized person under investigation here.</text>

            <text syncTime="623.937" offset="2599163">I think that’s right, I think that Mr. Justice Harlan in setting forth the criteria in the Powell case under which an Internal Revenue Service summons could be issued said, that one of the purposes and there were four was that the investigation must be conducted pursuant to a legitimate purpose and the second test that he used was whether inquiry was relevant to that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.129" offset="2699891">I think under these circumstances, the Internal Revenue Service’s desire to ascertain the identity of the depositor in this case under these circumstances is a legitimate inquiry and that is a legitimate investigation and that the inquiry to ascertain his identity is a relevant to that purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="683.288" offset="2836564">I think that it would unduly cripple the Internal Revenue Service’s power to ascertain the tax liability in determent of any person if the rule in this case promulgated by Court of Appeals that first the identity of the person had to be ascertained.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.956" offset="2919215">Well, with the law here, I think that the Internal Revenue Service has a broader power to under these statutes to ascertain the identity of the person under investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="735.931" offset="3047111">Now, in an amicus brief filed by the American Bankers Association, they, in facing these broad statutory purposes of Section 7601 and 7602 say simply that with respect to the statutory phrase determining the liability of any person for any Internal Revenue tax, they would impose a gloss on that provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="765.850" offset="3166751">Now, we say with respect to their first test, we think that's answered by the fact that we have a particularize depositor here.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.779" offset="3206457">With respect to whether the Internal Revenue Service had some evidence of liability, we would submit that that would resurrect the very probable cause requirement which the Court firmly rejected in Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.759" offset="3258389">The Internal Revenue Service is not bound by any probable cause requirement in issuing the summons or that it need have is an official suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.497" offset="3289318">And indeed under these circumstances, the suspicions are amply justified by the transactions that occurred in this case and not only the magnitude of the money involved but the fact that the money was found in rather unusual condition which suggested a long period of storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.002" offset="3363401">People do not usually keep money in an airless place unless they are hiding if for some reason and we think under these circumstances, the Internal Revenue Service had ample justification to seek the identity of the depositor here.</text>

            <text syncTime="881.871" offset="3630895">It’s simply talks about amount to denominations of $100 or higher and you can see in the third column of that in the middle of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.000" offset="3667362">Here, these two instances within 10 days of a deposited $20,000 in hundreds and there's a notation to hundreds in deteriorated condition apparently from long period of storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.705" offset="3722219">And there is a bank in -- and the name of the bank the Federal Reserve Bank is at the bottom and the name of the depositor bank is at the top.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.634" offset="3769866">Now, we think it’s absolutely clear on the basis of power that there is no probable cause requirement that binds the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.761" offset="3806438">Indeed, the court analogized the power of Internal Revenue Service in this case, the power to the inquisitorial power of a grand jury and surely the grand jury can sit in and investigate the entire industry for a particular period of time and look in and call people before it to offer testimony with respect to the subject matter to investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.083" offset="3899747">Now, we set forth in our brief what we think is rather strong legislative history in supported of this statutory argument that the Internal Revenue Service has this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.002" offset="3951365">In 1954, at the time of the codification of the present tax law, the summons power and the canvass power represented an amalgamation of three different provisions which were in the 1939 Code and which in turn date back to statutes going back as far as 1864.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.606" offset="4033808">Now, the particular statute which we think is relevant to Section 3654 (a) of the 1939 Code which similarly talks about the Internal Revenue Service’s power to look into and to insure that the tax laws are being faithfully obeyed and that the collector had this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.897" offset="4122937">And we think it is not without significance that in 1878 when Congress was debating the very sort of procedural question is to whether to transfer or to a court the summons powers that were held by collectors to another agents in the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.012" offset="4207470">The debates made a reference to an incident where the Internal Revenue Service served as summons upon a railroad in order to ascertain the identity of a shipper of liquor which was believed to have been shipped on tax and the railroad complied with that provision -- with that summons and offered up its books of account in connection with that inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.082" offset="4303705">Of course there was no income tax in 1878, but there were excise taxes on liquor and we think that Congress was well aware of the fact that if it accorded this power to the Internal Revenue Service to ascertain the identities of persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.349" offset="4368802">Now, we think further that this legislative understanding which is -- was almost 100 years ago -- occurred almost 100 years ago is also reflected in the decisions of the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.070" offset="4411643">Indeed, apart from this case and the Humble Oil case which is presently pending on the Government’s petition for writ of certiorari and which I would imagine the Court is holding in connection with the disposition of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.385" offset="4464933">The Circuits have pretty well uniformly given the Internal Revenue Service the power to ascertain the identities of unknown persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.249" offset="4500355">One of the prime examples of this power is in connection with tax-return preparers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.087" offset="4531702">Four Circuits have held that tax-return preparers must under compulsion of an Internal Revenue summons issue give over to the Internal Revenue Service the names and social security numbers of their clients when the Internal Revenue Service has reason to believe that the preparer has filed returns which may not be completely accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.600" offset="4629817">I think if the Court has no further questions, I would like to save the remaining time for rebuttal.</text>
