            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear argument first this morning in 74-165 and the related cases, Blanchette and Others against Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.497" offset="157341">General Insurance Corporation is the first of the group.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.068" offset="175626">So Mr. Solicitor General, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="24.361" offset="200808">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.133" offset="211884">This is a direct appeal by the United States other federal parties, United States Rail Association and the trustees of the property of the Penn Central Transportation Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.526" offset="253471">A three-judge District Court determined that the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 is constitutionally deficient in significant aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.046" offset="291506">The United States support the constitutionality of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.778" offset="306448">There is also a cross appeal here by the trustee of the New Haven Railroad to have the act declared unconstitutional on grounds rejected by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.356" offset="344795">The appellees here on our appeal comprise the sole shareholder and the major creditors of the Penn Central Transportation Company, a railroad that will be important in any reorganization effective under the Rail Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.497" offset="401324">Time for argument is divided equally between the supporters of the act and the opponents of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.879" offset="422849">The supporters have divided our time as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.169" offset="440090">Mr. Cutler who represent the Rail Association and I will divide an hour and 13 minutes, though we hope to reserve some if it for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.090" offset="479692">Mr. Cutler will deal with the issues raised by the cross appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.914" offset="495052">I will deal with the issues raised by our appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.787" offset="510516">And Congressman Adams has been seated five minutes to support the act on somewhat different grounds with those advanced by Mr. Cutler and myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.859" offset="546774">Mr. Horsky for the Penn Central Trustees, who supports our position in part and opposes it in part perhaps now supports it will use the remainder of our time, plus some of the other sides time.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.253" offset="596407">He is in effect a bridge between the two sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.689" offset="610095">This litigation is crucial to the success or failure of Congress's plan to reorganize and to make viable the real network in the northeast.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.672" offset="646040">And the case bears, I think, as you look at the briefs a circus appearance of enormous complexity.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.084" offset="671744">But I think, it is quite simple in its basic concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.015" offset="691388">The core issue before us is whether the Rail Act will work in uncompensated taking of the shareholders and creditors' property in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.644" offset="741961">The three-judge District Court vowed that it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.740" offset="758366">The three-judge Special Court created by the Rail Act itself has more recently held that it would not and that the statute was therefore constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.875" offset="802879">It will be useful to sketch, I think, the real crisis in the northeastern United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.967" offset="823254">The main features of the act that its Congress has response to that crisis and the holding of the District Court which emasculates Congress' effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.019" offset="859408">By 1973, seven major railroads in the northeast were attempting to reorganize under Section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.749" offset="898382">Those proceedings were proven unsuccessful due to the seemingly insoluble financial difficulties of the roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.155" offset="927953">The imminence of financial collapse and the possible liquidation of this northeast rail network, threatened the immeasurable damage to the economy and to the national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.698" offset="966196">Congress responded with the Rail Reorganization Act we have before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.612" offset="985840">The primary purpose of that act is to create a new, profitable, privately owned rail system in the northeast and most importantly to do that rapidly, much more rapidly than is the custom under reorganization under Section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.089" offset="1059715">Within 180 days of the statutes enactment, each Court having jurisdiction over a railroad and reorganization was required to order that the reorganization proceed under the new Rail Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.080" offset="1107675">Unless it first, one, found that the railroad was recognizable on an income basis within a reasonable time and that the public interest would be better served by that form of reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.182" offset="1160129">Or two, found that the Rail Act does not provide a process which will be fair and equitable to the estate of the railroad and reorganization in which case the reorganization is to be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.272" offset="1216449">Appeal from this 180-day decision by the reorganization courts lies to a Special Court created by the act and that Court is composed now of Judges Friendly, McGowan, and Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.148" offset="1267963">Five of the reorganization courts found that the Act did not provide a fair inequitable process, two founded that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.542" offset="1309550">The appeals were taken and the Special Court has now found that the reorganization act does provide a fair and equitable process and that decision explicitly includes that the termination of the Act will not work an uncompensated taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.858" offset="1374856">The Act also establishes United States Rail Association, which is a public nonprofit corporation and it is required to formulate a final system plan that will establish and maintain a financially self-sustaining rail system adequate to the needs of the northeast.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.769" offset="1446431">The centerpiece of this final system plan is to be a new for profit corporation, a consolidated rail corporation, Conrail.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.684" offset="1490108">The bulk of the rail properties will go to Conrail, although, some maybe sold under the final system plan to profitable railroads in the area, to Amtrak, and to state and local transportation authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.235" offset="1544338">This plan is to be laid before Congress within 450 days of the passage of the Rail Act, although, the rail association has now requested to Congress a 120-day extension of that deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.865" offset="1598882">The final system plan becomes effective, if it is not disapproved by either House within 60 session days.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.772" offset="1638484">Within 90 days after that, the plan is to be certified to the Special Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.772" offset="1662412">The Special Court will then order the transfer out of the rail properties from the bankrupt estates to Conrail and have the securities and obligations and benefits of Conrail transferred back to the bankrupt estates.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.076" offset="1735659">Subsequently, it will determine the fairness and the equity of the consideration given in return to these states and that consideration, a package of securities and benefits given is not to exceed the constitutional minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.035" offset="1803473">Now that consideration given to the bankrupt estates, the rail estates, is to consist of stock and securities of Conrail and up to $500 million of the association's obligations, which are held by Conrail and which are federally guaranteed and other benefits under the act such as payments for labor termination and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.046" offset="1891558">If this consideration exceeds the constitutional minimum, the Court must order the excess returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.048" offset="1927607">It may reallocate the consideration among the transfer or rail estates and if necessary, it may enter a deficiency judgment in the estates' favor against Conrail or against profitable railroads that receive property from these -- the bankrupt estates.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.850" offset="2006810">The entire judgment of the Special Court on the evaluation issue is then reviewable by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.496" offset="2037321">Now, although the constitutionality of this statutory scheme was being litigated in various reorganization courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.320" offset="2072639">These cases were brought in District Courts, not reorganization courts by the Penn Central Shareholder and by the major creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.357" offset="2104822">They were consolidated by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation in the three-judge District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.991" offset="2139303">Now, that Court from which we appeal determined as follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.303" offset="2160619">It said first, that the question whether the final transfer of rail properties from the rail estates to Conrail would affect an unconstitutional taking was not yet right for adjudication.</text>

            <text syncTime="538.467" offset="2257272">But there is no appeal here from the Special Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="543.447" offset="2277125">Under the statute, it is not considered an appeal.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="547.981" stopTime="549.674">
            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="547.981" offset="2295306">That's another question.</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="549.674" stopTime="634.028">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="549.674" offset="2302098">That could be another question Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.890" offset="2310980">I trust it will not become one in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.336" offset="2332714">Second, there is the problem of interim erosion which the three-judge District Court of the bankrupt estates -- three of the Courts that the interim erosion that is the losses incurred by these railroads in continuing service prior to the final transferred date might amount to a taking in the Fifth Amendment since they thought that taking may have occurred or may soon occur, at least there was a possibility and therefore, that issue of interim erosion is right for adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.254" offset="2480358">The Court therefore enjoined the rail association from acting under Section 304 (f) of the Rail Act, to prohibit any reduction of service that is requested and that maybe determined by a Court to be necessary to prevent an unconstitutional taking of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.668" offset="2570010">Third, the Court enjoined the enforcement of Section 20 (b), which requires the dismissal of the reorganization proceeding under certain circumstances that stage of the case has passed and I think that ruling has now essentially become irrelevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="696.345" offset="2888704">Perhaps, Mr. Cutler maybe able to answer the question of that, but in any event, I think 207 (b) is effectively behind this because no such dismissals occurred and under the ruling of Special Court would not as --.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.421" offset="2965086">Finally, the Court without particularly stating any reasons enjoined the associations from certifying a final system plan for judicial review under the provisions of Section 209 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="729.139" offset="3019943">Now, this injunction against certifying a final system plan to the Special Court respectively prevents the consummation of the congressional plan or creating this new Conrail and that means in effect that the statute is at that stage understands still and cannot under going to affect.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.749" offset="3110327">Now, there have been many contentions here and I think for most of them perhaps rely upon the briefs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1812.766" offset="7354389">The Tucker Act was available because a taking had occurred by lawful authorized action of the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1851.788" offset="7510497">I think, we must therefore examine the act to see if there is a clearly implied repeal.And in doing so, we have employed two canons of construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1871.658" offset="7590013">But these are canons long known to the law and they binding up on Congress in drafting statute because that's how they know how the statute will be interpreted as they are indispensable to Courts in interpreting statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.645" offset="7649991">I sight just two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.480" offset="7657305">The first is that repeals by implication are not favored in our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.593" offset="7673710">The second is that when there are two admissible constructions of a statute, that construction which will save the constitutionality in the statute is favored over that which condemns the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.460" offset="7725223">There's no doubt that the opponents of the Rail Act here are asking for a partial repeal of the Tucker Act by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.150" offset="7763989">They also urge reconstruction of the Rail Act that they say does result in its unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.693" offset="7794186">They have their own canon of construction and they are precisely the opposite of those that the law recognizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.462" offset="7821249">Now the strength of this presumption against complied repeals, I think it's much greater in the Tucker Act area than perhaps it is elsewhere and that shown I think by two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.614" offset="7869837">I would like to mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.257" offset="7872449">The first is Hurley against Kincaid and the second is Lynch against United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.181" offset="7896064">Although, decisions of this Court retain their vitality as I think they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.676" offset="7918111">Then, I think they are completely dispositive of the Tucker Act question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.746" offset="7938382">The Special Court in Judge Friendly's opinion said that Hurley against Kincaid did not support our position as strongly as we had urged, but it went on the note that there was case called Lynch, which we had not sited which did support our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.772" offset="8006510">We oblige as we accept the gift of Lynch but we continue to believe that Hurley against Kincaid has pertinence here as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.951" offset="8043186">In that case, the point of Kincaid conceded to enjoin the construction of flood way that threatened his land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.765" offset="8070457">In Section 3 of the Flood Control Act under which the Government was proceeding stated that, no liability of any kind shall attach to rest upon the United States for any damage from replied floods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.128" offset="8123852">Section 4 of the Act provided for advance compensation for the taking of land by condemnation of necessary lands and easements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.872" offset="8166902">Now, the parties advance as here a wide variety of factual legal contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.937" offset="8187068">But the Supreme Court held simply that the injunction should not issue because the event that taking occurred, the complainant can recover just compensation under the Tucker Act in compensation of the law, an enactment law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.822" offset="8254673">Hurley against Kincaid now stands at a minimum where two prepositions that a statutory program may not be enjoined in anticipation of a taking where the Tucker Act is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.444" offset="8325099">And this is a case I suppose that goes to the question of whether the rightness of a tucker issue is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.914" offset="8354983">A statutory program may not be enjoined in anticipation of a taking where a Tucker Act remedy is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.623" offset="8385912">And secondly, that the repeal of the Tucker Act is not to be implied from the presence in the program statute of an alternative method of compensating those whose property is taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.547" offset="8449546">These prepositions are highly relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.658" offset="8461981">The -- those who seek to enjoin the operation of the Rail Act argued that the implied repeal of the Tucker Act is to be found in Section 303 of the Rail Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.106" offset="8515793">Among other places, tried Section 303 provides modes of compensating the bankrupt estates or rail properties transferred under the final system plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.261" offset="8560410">And they say that, the existence in the Rail Act of alternative modes of compensation implies the absence of any other form of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.074" offset="8603669">I think that would be a thin argument for repeal of the Tucker Act at best.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.871" offset="8626866">The Court has asked to find an imply appeal for the purpose of destroying the constitutionality of the very statute to which the repeal is attributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.650" offset="8670020">So far as we know, no case has ever found an implied repeal in order to impute to the statute itself an intention to commit suicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.449" offset="8717145">If there is any doubt on this issue, I think Hurley against Kincaid lays into rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.104" offset="8747760">The Flood Control Act provided its own means of property acquisition and compensation for taking to find an implied repeal in Hurley against Kincaid would be much easier because all that would have happen would have been an injunction would have been issue and slow the progress of the work until a condemnation occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.881" offset="8826859">So, that only inconvenience was involved in finding an implied repeal there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.776" offset="8850474">Here, to find an implied repeal is to find the Act unconstitutional in major aspects and bring the program to a complete all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.727" offset="8894255">Lynch against United States, the case found by Judge Friendly reinforces rather than replaces Kincaid in our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.860" offset="8934797">In that case, actions were brought for proceeds of Government insurance policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.973" offset="8955277">The insured in each case has become totally disabled while the policies were enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.162" offset="8980041">Under the policies terms in such circumstances, compensation must be given to pay the premiums of the policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.691" offset="9010134">The compensation was not given and the insurance died.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.832" offset="9030719">United States demurred to this lawsuit on the ground that Section 7 of the Economy Act, Section 17 of the Economy Act of 1933 stated specifically, all laws granting or pertaining to yearly renewable term insurance are hereby repealed, a much more explicit and clear repealer than anything to found in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.815" offset="9138657">This Supreme Court held that as applied to contract rights, that repealer was a taking of property forbidden by the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.883" offset="9174915">But the Congress of course, did have the power to withdraw its consent to suit against United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.494" offset="9205321">And the Government argued here that it was obvious that when Congress took away the right, it should be presumed to have contended to takeaway the remedy which it seems to be a rather plausible argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.092" offset="9267702">Nevertheless, this Court refused to read the statute is taking away the remedy in the absence of a multi-explicit direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.576" offset="9297690">It said, "There is no separate provision in Section 17 dealing with the remedy and it does not appear that Congress wish to deny the remedy, if the repeal of the contractual right was held void under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.266" offset="9364459">Now Judge Friendly points out the exact application of this reasoning to our case by saying, "Translated into the terms of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.772" offset="9406464">There is no separate provision in the Rail Reorganization Act dealing with the Tucker Act remedy and it does not appear that Congress wished deny this remedy, if the Act should be held to involve a possible taking that would require the award of a just compensation under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.758" offset="9486399">So Lynch demonstrates, I think the Court is not willing to find the repeal of the Tucker Act remedy unless Congress specifically states that what -- that's what wants a much stronger indication in the Economy Act than there is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.217" offset="9540211">Now, these conclusions from Hurley and Lynch which I think are dispositive of this case are strengthened by examining the Rail Act, its text, its structure, its legislative history, and finally views now pressed upon us by the compress it upon you by some members of the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.194" offset="9604159">The tax to the Rail Act I submit yields only one implausible explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.908" offset="9627042">The Tucker Act is not mentioned and yet, there are 13 provisions in the Rail Act which deal with the relationship of other statutes to the Rail Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.335" offset="9664763">Congress went through quite specifically repealing in part, modifying in part, and dealing with the relationships of other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.742" offset="9698304">In 13 places and I refer you to Section 601, which deals with major statutes and specifically entitle a relationship to other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.950" offset="9739160">And it seems quite peculiar to say that, Congress took meticulous care to spell out the repeal of advertising requirements having to do with the entry of Government contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.716" offset="9790255">But did not think it was worth mentioning that it was contemplating the uncompensated taking of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.979" offset="9815333">That is not just improper statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.828" offset="9826722">I think it is bizarre statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.270" offset="9840410">If we look to the structure of the Act, we see the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.291" offset="9856502">Section 304 (f) shows that very few abandonments are to be permitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2515.409" offset="10165060">In order to find a repeal of the Tucker Act, we have to be asked to belief that the Congress knowingly insisted upon continued operations knew that they might cause losses and for that reason repeal the Tucker Act because it did not want to compensate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.035" offset="10239561">The same thing is true of the final system, final transfer provisions in Section 303.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.573" offset="10269654">We are asked to believe that Congress knowingly required to transfer and knew might conceivably fall short of just compensation and yet intended that that should occur not to compensate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.188" offset="10320123">Indeed, there is no reason here to impute any implied repeal of the Tucker Act to Congress except to impute the Congress a desire not to pay as it turned out that there was no constitutional taking and I do not think that kind of intent ever ought to be imputed to Congress, unless Congress makes that imputation unavoidable by specific language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.658" offset="10425971">Maybe that Congress never even thought about the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.248" offset="10436315">I think that's quite likely, but if it mandated a course of behavior that results in the taking that is enough to make the Tucker Act remedy available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.201" offset="10468185">I won't follow the legislative history because the legislative history shows no more than that Congress was not thinking about the Tucker Act and Congress thought that Section 303 would provide adequate compensation, but if they are wrong, we think the Tucker Act is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.792" offset="10550523">Now, I want to spend a moment addressing myself because there is nothing left in this case it seems to me in Tucker Act point except, we are offered the views of a number of Congressmen as to what they intended when they ask the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.515" offset="10609455">And Congressman Brooke Adams will speak for them here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.173" offset="10624084">I have no doubt whatever sincerity of their views and I have no doubt whatever is to the accuracy of their statement of their intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.303" offset="10656580">But I object to their consideration of statement of intention on the grounds that they didn't wait when worker radical reconstruction in the constitutional relationship between Congress and this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.669" offset="10718020">This Court discerns like it have been intended in the statute were debates from the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.912" offset="10742993">It should not look to what individual Congress say they intended afterwards when those intentions were never expressed to the Senate, to the House that adopted the bill or to the President who signed in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.825" offset="10798686">We do not know what the results would have been if the Tucker Act issue have been explored in Congress or relayed before the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.196" offset="10836198">But even if there were a brief here from a majority of both houses, my argument would be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.955" offset="10867231">The Constitution provides for a legislative process and perhaps, if the minority -- if these views and issues had been aired, perhaps the minority would have convinced the others on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.577" offset="10921671">And it is simply wrong to take views expressed afterwards which never went though the legislative process and visit by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.896" offset="10974960">If a present statement of prior legislative intent were given effect, I think we might have to have a different kind of trial when we went into legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.278" offset="11012472">We might have to examine or take affidavits from Congressman as to what they thought about issues, in fact when they voted on the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.650" offset="11049984">As to many statutes, that would be impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.478" offset="11057298">I suggest to that in all of it would be improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.977" offset="11071300">We are becoming getting dangerously close at that stage to the method of statutory analysis which was rejected by this Court and by Chief Justice Marshall in Fletcher against Craig and he answer when broad case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.233" offset="11128351">Now, I make this argument solely out of concern for the law and the proper processes of interpreting statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.908" offset="11158967">If I am wrong, if my submission is rejected, I would be sorry for the law but I would quite glad for my position in this case because I think Congressman Adams' brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.557" offset="11213615">If we are to consider his statement of what Congress intended supports the position I have been arguing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.856" offset="11238797">He said on page 17, The Tucker Act was not considered by the Congress in creating the Rail Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.492" offset="11285295">It is a jurisdictional statute often used to settle private claims that was neither repealed nor engrafted onto the Act to create a possible deficiency judgment against the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.175" offset="11348093">That seems to me, if you consider this expose fact those statements of legislative intent to be precisely in line with our contention that when Congress doesn't consider the Tucker Act, but does something that affects a taking that Tucker Act remains unavailable remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.525" offset="11433462">Now, Congressman Adams and others expressed a fear that we are and they would giving the rail estates the key to the treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.594" offset="11465749">There's no basis for that concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.408" offset="11477034">That Congress and not the Department of Justice controls the first and should this Court agree that the Tucker Act remedy remains available here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.236" offset="11516322">Congress may have wishes the following date repeal the Tucker Act that it applies to this case or make any other amendments to the Rail Act that it wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.109" offset="11559790">The final disposition of this entire matter is for Congress, whichever way this case goes, are we talking is to discern the legal situation as Congress has left it so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.674" offset="11618095">Now, I would like to close at hypothetical, I think illustrates the strength of our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.248" offset="11636381">Suppose our position were emerged in the Tucker Act issue because but suppose this litigation did not occur now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.756" offset="11662399">But we went down the road for five years and discover that they have been occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.563" offset="11689671">These creditors sue us in the Court of Claims and the Government comes in and demurs on the grounds that the Rail Act has impliedly repealed the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.281" offset="11732511">It is true we have taken your property but then we are terribly sorry, but there is nothing can be done about it because we can find in an implied repeal of the Tucker Act in the Rail Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.674" offset="11774098">I submit to you that that argument wouldn't stand a chance in the Court of Claims or in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.647" offset="11801997">The cases were not implied repeal under those circumstances would be seen to be artificial then unjust and fully unpersuasive.</text>

            <text syncTime="2980.696" offset="12026128">In our brief as appellee, we argue that the court below correctly rejected this attack as premature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.651" offset="12061968">But now that the Special Court has rejected the same attack on its merits and the statute purports to barred direct review of that decision, we agree with the Solicitor General and with Mr. Horsky who will argue the point in more detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.455" offset="12129155">That it would be inappropriate exercise of these Court's discretion to reach and decide these issues on this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.365" offset="12168861">As to the Tucker Act, it seems to us it is really an academic point anyway because if you rich the Tucker Act issues on erosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.405" offset="12205014">Whatever you decide as to that will necessarily, we believe, decide the availability of the Tucker Act as to the final transfers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3072.372" offset="12392887">If the final transfer provisions of this Act are later, some later date, held unconstitutional by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.209" offset="12432175">Now, the New Haven Trustee argues that these provisions are unconstitutional on numerous grounds of which I have time to take up only three.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.983" offset="12467284">The first is that, the Act requires the transfers to occur before the adequacy of the consideration is judicially bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.229" offset="12508244">While the resources provided by the Act to provide the consideration and their view maybe inadequate so that the constitutional minimum may never be received.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.663" offset="12557981">The provision for a transfer first and the for judicial evaluation later is the critical genius of the Rail Act in our view because in that way, Congress broke the procedural logjam for devising and approving a railroad reorganization plan that has plague the ICC and the judiciary for decades.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.717" offset="12658291">Some -- a procedure that took so much time, some 15 years in the Missouri Pacific case that even if the solution could be evolved, it would no longer be relevant to the problem to which it was addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.445" offset="12721194">But by this method of transfer first, Congress made it possible for the rail entity to start business within some two years after the passage of the Act for the railroad estates to be relieved of the so called "erosion burden" of providing rail service at that time and for the time consuming process of adjudicating evaluations and distributing proceeds, first to the rail estates, and then among the various creditor classes in each state could take its course after rather than before the new entity starts business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.593" offset="12865703">A transfer first followed by evaluation judicially later was of course the last ditch procedure finally adopted by Judge Anderson in the New Haven cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.432" offset="12913142">And no one found constitutional fault in that procedure since inadequate judicial assurance of compensation was thought to be available from Penn Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.188" offset="12960162">Here, we say this much more solid assurance in the Rail Act and the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.089" offset="12983777">If the Special Court cannot itself provide the constitutional minimum out of the over $2 billion of resources that are provided under this Act, inadequate remedy under the Tucker Act remains available for the reasons given by the Solicitor General and approved by Judge Friendly in his Special Court of opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.871" offset="13070817">Now the New Haven Trustee, unlike his co-plaintiff, Connecticut General, concedes that the Rail Act did not bar a suit under the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.931" offset="13123062">What he argues is that under the Youngstown case, the Steel Seizure case, a Tucker Act suit if he brought one or the rail estate brought one would not succeed on its merits because the statute requiring the transfers, the Rail Act in his view is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.902" offset="13199026">But there can't be any doubt that those required transfers first are precisely what Congress has authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.741" offset="13234343">And if the right to sue under the Tucker Act is left intact by the Rail Act as the New Haven Trustee concedes, there are just no basis for calling the Rail Act itself unconstitutional and the transfers that it requires unauthorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.166" offset="13295992">Youngstown is very different as Judge Friendly points out at page 102 of his opinion because there, the President seizure of the steel plants had nothing authorized let alone commanded by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.116" offset="13355865">The New Haven Trustee second point is that the Rail Act is not a valid exercise of the bankruptcy power but it is a condemnation wolf masquerading in bankruptcy sheep's clothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.943" offset="13411140">He urges that the so called "cram down power", previously upheld by this Court under Section 77, cannot constitutionally be invoked to cram down on all creditor classes as distinguished from only one or two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.678" offset="13482088">But as the Rock Allen case suggest and as the Special Court rule, Section 77 does not exhaust the limits of the bankruptcy power.And there doesn't seemed to be any constitutional reason why Congress cannot cram down still further, if it deems that this is the only way of assuring continued rail service by a viable private firm particularly whereas here in east, viability requires the consolidation into one new system of properties from several bankrupt railroads each with their own myriad classes of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.880" offset="13638928">So, long as the constitutional minimum consideration is assured, rail creditors have no constitutional right merely by withholding their consent to a plan to insist on condemnation and public ownership instead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.248" offset="13712384">Third, the new Haven Trustee argues that Congress cannot constitutionally exercise its bankruptcy in commerce powers in combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.532" offset="13745507">So, as to require rail estates to accept the securities of the reorganized firm as part of this fair and equitable constitutional minimum and, if any balance is required to accept Government guaranteed user obligations, which are provided in this Act up to at least $500 million, and perhaps more, and other benefits under the Rail Act, and if still needed a claim under the Tucker Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.868" offset="13866820">He argues that if there is any possible need for Government compensation, then the entire transaction is a taking of property for public use and entitles the rail estates to payment entirely in cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.850" offset="13930768">But as the Special Court held, the Constitution we say does not bar Congress from exercising its powers in combination, so as to minimize the drain in the federal treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.379" offset="13980923">Section 77, itself is an exercise of both the bankruptcy and the commerce powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.735" offset="14010284">As the Special Court put it, Congress is not required to steer the ship of state into the cellar of nationalization for cash or the cribbed these of a rail shutdown.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.699" offset="14066186">Congress can steer in between, if a viable reorganized entity with significant earning power can be created.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.612" offset="14101817">There's no taking of property for public use to the extent that valuable securities of the new entity are given in exchange for the rail properties transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.724" offset="14150301">After fair value of those properties is judicially determined to be less than the fair value of the securities is judicially is determined to be less than the fair value of the properties transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.203" offset="14204217">And the transfer of the properties is still congressionally and judicially compelled, then there maybe a taking to the extent of the shortfall, but only to that extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.987" offset="14255313">At this point of course, we do not know whether there will be a shortfall, But if one is judicially determined, Congress has provided, as I said, at least $500 million of Government guaranteed securities for direct transfer to the rail estates to preserve the power to provide more and it is going to review this final system plan before it gets to Court, and it is also providing other benefits under the Act, and it is left, we say the Tucker Act remedy available for any balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.281" offset="14400449">I should take a moment on Mr. Justice Douglas's question about Conrail as a federal instrumentality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.257" offset="14428348">And we would say Mr. Justice Douglas that it is not, it is a private corporation and while it is true that so long as the majority of its debt has been advanced or guaranteed by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.935" offset="14483101">That a majority of the directors maybe named by the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.864" offset="14498879">Those directors will have the same duty as any other directors to all of the shareholders, namely these creditors in other States and the duty to make a profit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3817.436" offset="15373145">The reason that I am here this morning is that the primary intent of this statute was contrary to some of the statements of Government counsel, not ever to be a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.766" offset="15422464">The properties are never taken from the individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.948" offset="15439182">But instead, we have tried logically to extend the powers of the reorganization statute is set forth and interpreted by this Court in the New Haven Inclusion cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.606" offset="15489755">The whole history of this statute was for us to try to create a buyer where none existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.533" offset="15517550">Make an offer to these reorganization courts, give all of the stock in exchange for the assets that are transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.214" offset="15556211">So, that the original creditors are crammed down, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.856" offset="15574810">But they receive full interest in this corporation, plus $2 billion worth of Government advantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3876.344" offset="15608769">And when they are finished with this and the Court values at some later time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.783" offset="15634474">If there has been a mistake in the manner in which the process operated, then these parties can sue as Justice White was asking in his question, "Is there a right to sue for some failure, maybe we hold the party too long," then, they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.119" offset="15715871">But the two primary issues are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.736" offset="15726320">How long can hold these parties?</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.529" offset="15733530">That was what concerned the lower court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.162" offset="15748054">We think they can be held during this limited period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.119" offset="15763832">And if they can be held during that period of time and you adjust what they received in terms of stock or you set a different date for transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3925.231" offset="15804270">Then, their erosion problems are taken care off in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3930.365" offset="15824854">The second problem however and the one we are concerned about with the so called "Tucker Act argument," which I think is a rehearing is whether or not this statute in its process provides for a deficiency judgment against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.944" offset="15887130">And our problem very simply in Congress and it is stated in our brief in the appendix and it runs through all of the other briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.737" offset="15918268">This was discussed great length in Congress and the Congress wanted to go only so far in granting funds to reorganize this process, and they did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.336" offset="15968737">Now, as far as the cost the case is concerned, Hurley versus Kincaid and the other Tucker Act cases, we did not try to repeal the Fifth Amendment or certainly repeal the Tucker Act jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.969" offset="16027251">That issue will depend upon the facts after this process is over whether an individual party has been injured by a lawful act of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.187" offset="16076152">But the key issue before the Court this morning is, "Is this process lawful?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.891" offset="16098931">Can we use the reorganization process?</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.320" offset="16112619">Can we under the logical extension of this Court's ruling in the Denver Rio Grand case and in the New Haven Inclusion cases go through this process with this people?</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.893" offset="16162983">We think that the Congress did this properly and we hope this Court will hold that the statute -- its process is constitutional, that the cram down of stock for assets is valid.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Horsky</label>
            <text syncTime="4171.906" offset="16790967">The Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.968" offset="16803192">The reply brief filed a few days ago in which the Solicitor General took the position that the issues were available and before the Court has made vast difference in our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.100" offset="16855751">First, let me say a few things in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.609" offset="16873827">The trustees believe that the basic concept of this Act is a sound concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="4199.218" offset="16900263">As the Solicitor General has said, the rail crisis at the northeast railroads created a situation which was clearly beyond the power of the trustees or the reorganization courts or Section 77 to resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="4215.693" offset="16966196">The compulsory restructuring of all of these bankrupt railroads in the northeast under the Act is certainly a potential solution to a very serious natural problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4228.756" offset="17018441">There are good many imponderables in the Act it will have to be resolved in the months and then, the years that are coming down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="4236.266" offset="17048430">And the remains as I think, everyone would concede they have possibility that the quite disparate goals that the Act requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="4248.393" offset="17096913">That is, that there would be a profitable Conrail created and that it would be adequate to serve the rail needs of the northeast are not both realizable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.644" offset="17137977">But the effort certainly is worthwhile and should be continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="4262.516" offset="17153442">Second and particularly important is the agreement we have now with the Solicitor General that issue before the Court as to the constitutionality of the Act is properly before the Court and should be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4281.714" offset="17230242">Let me take the --it should be resolved, part of it first because I cannot overestimate, cannot overstate the importance of having a decision in these cases on the constitutional questions, unless and until this Court decides whether the process -- whether this key is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="4303.840" offset="17318745">The plain fact is that the situation, the rail situation in the northeast is going to get worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="4310.760" offset="17346435">On the Penn Central alone, there are thousands of miles of track that are so badly in need of repair, the trains can move over them only at reduced speeds, 10 miles an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="4323.382" offset="17396903">And there are many thousands of cars and many thousands of locomotives that are not usable because there is no money to repair them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.531" offset="17429504">The Act in Section 215 reports to provide a $150 million of temporary money for improvement while this planning process is going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4345.276" offset="17484466">As a practical matter, that $150 million will continue to be unavailable until the constitutional doubts about the Act have been resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.828" offset="17526680">Moreover and particularly important from the point of view of my clients, the trustees, they themselves are unable so long as constitutional doubts exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="4368.232" offset="17576312">To know how they should use the limited cash resources that they have in connection with the operation and maintenance repair of this railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4378.788" offset="17618526">If the estate, if the Penn Central State has no reasonable chance of reasonable prospect of compensation for interim erosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.310" offset="17664606">Common prudence on the part of the trustees would suggest that the cash they do have be used at the maximum extent possible to prevent the continuing approval of the administration claim such as taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4404.660" offset="17721971">The decision on the constitutional issue will really relive both the public and the trustees of the burden of the present situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.565" offset="17765648">I agree fully with what Mr. Cutler has said about it, but I would like to emphasize it in space, it's terribly important.</text>
            <text syncTime="4424.398" offset="17800965">Third, we agree with the Solicitor General as to what the constitutional issue is, "Is the Tucker Act available?"</text>
            <text syncTime="4432.678" offset="17834088">Now I appreciate, but the fact that we all say that you want to decide the case, it doesn't mean that you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.610" offset="17857808">You've got to persuaded that the issue is right for decision and that it is appropriate that you decide it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4446.119" offset="17887796">I think it is and let me say a few words briefly on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4450.891" offset="17906918">The areas the Solicitor General has indicated to you two quite discreet Fifth Amendment problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="4458.970" offset="17939205">One is whether, the compensation available under the Act where the rail properties which will be compelled, which the Penn Central will be compelled to convey to Conrail will be adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4473.008" offset="17995421">The second is whether, there will be because of the extent the length of time that the planning process takes an unconstitutional taking by way of interim erosion of the Penn Central state because it will continue to operate as it does now at huge, huge annual losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4496.818" offset="18090611">On the first of these issues, the court below said the issue was premature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4503.625" offset="18117883">We've set out in our brief, pages 48 to 54, the reasons why we think the lower court was in error as to its reasons for believing premature and the Government parties have adopted our argument as theirs and their replied brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4521.078" offset="18187682">But without going into the details of that argument, let me emphasize this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.319" offset="18212655">Under the doctrines as I understand, cases like the Ashwander case with Poe and Ullman, this issue is right for decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4536.907" offset="18251003">There is not any doubt but the -- there will be under this statute a conveyance of properties from Penn Central estate to Conrail.</text>
            <text syncTime="4547.640" offset="18293948">There was a suggestion, which hasn't been mentioned here, but perhaps would just confuse you.</text>
            <text syncTime="4553.234" offset="18316309">But there has -- was a suggestion that you could litigate this question before the Special Court, just before the transfer took place after the plan had been finally approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4563.586" offset="18357687">The Special Court said in its opinion that that was not possible in the time that they have, which might be as little as 10 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="4571.768" offset="18390392">They certainly couldn't under to decide whether or not there was constitutional consideration provided in the plan for the properties that would be conveyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4581.401" offset="18428949">The fact is that this conveyance is going to happen and that there is no other Court, no other procedure by which we can find out whether or not that the process is constitutional, whether the Tucker Act apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="4598.011" offset="18495404">Now the other point, which I think is even more important, it -- but perhaps sounds a little bit like blackmail, but it is important than the less.</text>
            <text syncTime="4606.933" offset="18531140">The Special Court has ruled as you will find if you read its opinion, that the mandatory conveyance features, what I am talking about are constitutional, not standing alone but only because there is a Tucker Act remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4624.197" offset="18600208">Consequently, if this Court and it indicated that if there wasn't a Tucker Act remedy, it would be forced to operate under the statute to remove the estates from the operation of the Act, because it would find that the process of the act was not fair and equitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4642.137" offset="18671888">Consequently, if this Court does not provide the assurance -- let me go back.</text>
            <text syncTime="4646.405" offset="18689024">The Special Court also said, "It was holding its final decision in advance pending the decision of this Court as it was entirely proper Court to do."</text>
            <text syncTime="4656.657" offset="18729984">But if this Court therefore does not provide the assurance that the Tucker Act remedy is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="4663.616" offset="18757883">The Special Court has very strongly intimated that what it will do, will be to decide that the process of the Act is not fair and equitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4672.071" offset="18791633">And that will therefore, discharge all the railroads including Penn Central from the operation of the Act and the act will abort.</text>
            <text syncTime="4680.001" offset="18823398">So, for practical reasons and I think for very good legal reasons, we strongly urge that you come to the question of the Tucker Act and decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4692.538" offset="18873553">Now, I do not think you have to get into as much trouble with respect to interim erosion problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.024" offset="18899466">That's the second of the problems that are raised by the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4703.108" offset="18915767">The court below reached it on that basis by holding that there was such likelihood that that there would be a point reached or the continued compulsory operation of the estate at loss would be unconstitutional that they ought to decide whether it was appropriate to do that and whether there was Tucker Act remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4725.490" offset="19005315">Now, the conclusion of the court is to whether that s likely is subject to vat amount of writing in these briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4732.563" offset="19033631">There's controversy over, what constitutes erosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4736.351" offset="19048782">There is controversy over, how you measure erosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4739.265" offset="19060381">There is controversy over, what the various measurement shows as to what the erosion has been in the past and what it will be in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="4748.628" offset="19097893">There is uncertainty to be sure as to how long the planning process will last.</text>
            <text syncTime="4755.484" offset="19125269">The timetable itself as the Solicitor General has indicated has been extended ones by four months by Senate joint Resolution 250, which is on the President's desk now for signature having pass both Houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4770.331" offset="19184724">And I have no doubt it would be signed by President Ford, shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4774.352" offset="19200815">And there is the possibility under the Act that Congress may reject the plan provided by USRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.303" offset="19236551">It has 60 days within which it can be veto either House can veto the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.101" offset="19259747">At that point, although there is a tight time schedule up to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4793.111" offset="19275839">At that point, there is no time schedule for USRA to submit the next one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.843" offset="19290781">It has to do it, but it can take it sweet time about it, the next month and the next month after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.578" offset="19317635">So, that nobody can be sure how long Penn Central will be continuing to operate its rail properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4811.882" offset="19350862">All of these mean that there is disagreement to a degree over the likelihood or the degree of likelihood that there will be a point of unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.456" offset="19389210">But everybody agrees that it will be that there is some possibility of it and in that event, only a Tucker Act will save the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.786" offset="19430484">And I further agree with what Mr. Cutler said.</text>
            <text syncTime="4834.608" offset="19441768">If you find that the Tucker Act is available on either the unconstitutional erosion or on the improper taking, you have answered the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.161" offset="19480012">Because nobody has suggested that the Tucker Act is available for some of the takings under the statute, but not for all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.918" offset="19515016">Well, so much for the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4858.729" offset="19538317">I don't believe that I need to add anything to what the Solicitor General has said about the nature of the argument on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4871.998" offset="19591398">But I would like to make a couple of comments, which I think the Solicitor General did not make and which I think irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4883.315" offset="19636642">I perhaps, do not correctly read judge Aldisert's opinion below but I sense in this comment he said that if he found there were Court of Claims remedy, it would be, "Judicial legislation on a grand if not arrogant scale."</text>
            <text syncTime="4904.639" offset="19721906">I think, I sense in that a feeling that what he was afraid of was that the possibility of a Court of Claims judgment if there were jurisdiction in the Court of Claims would be huge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4916.339" offset="19768717">It might be hundreds of millions of dollars or even more than that and of that was one of the reasons why he thought that he could not appropriately say that the Court of Claims judgment was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="4930.548" offset="19825560">If that is true, if there is any relevance to the question of the availability of the Tucker Act as to the size of the potential judgment against United States, there are a couple of considerations which the Court should have in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4946.932" offset="19891075">The first is that, a decision now by the Court that a Court of Claims remedy would be available to remedy any inadequate compensation in the taking by the compulsory transfer is no sense as the Solicitor General has said an ex post facto argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.903" offset="19966934">The Congress can deal with that in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="4969.840" offset="19982712">In the first place, it has to look at the plans that come from USRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="4975.349" offset="20004760">If it gets the first plan and the financial viability of Conrail looks pretty shaky or they are not sure that it is going to be adequately funded or adequately profitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4987.886" offset="20054915">They can send USRA back to the drawing boards because they would say, "We do not want to take the chance that this one might cause a very large Court of Claims judgment."</text>
            <text syncTime="4999.358" offset="20100786">And they can continue to do that until they are satisfied that what the plan provides will either minimize or eliminate the possibility of a Tucker Act judgment of any substantial size.</text>
            <text syncTime="5012.841" offset="20154702">And secondly of course as the Solicitor General says, they can repeal or amend the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5019.034" offset="20179466">But I think it -- this is a fair comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5022.258" offset="20192423">I believe that it is probably true that this statute with the combination of the power of the Congress to reject the plans it does not like, so it gets a plan it wants combined with the sort of combination, reorganization, condemnation features of the plan with the Tucker Act remedy at the end is probably the least expensive way for Congress to preserve an important national asset which is now no longer able to preserve itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5055.044" offset="20323558">Or to put it boldly, I think Congress would prefer a Tucker Act remedy to the requirement that nationalize this railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="5064.049" offset="20359607">Let me make one other comment which is important to us in terms of the Tucker Act in which the Solicitor General has not mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.488" offset="20409344">In the court below and in this Court, the appellees as Mr. Cutler has pointed out, that even if you have a Tucker Act it really is not adequate, it is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="5088.894" offset="20458977">We disagree basically with the appellees on that point but we do have some concern that if the Court finds, that there is a Tucker Act remedy, that we can maintain a suit in the Court of Claims, that we have an adequate remedy on the Court of Claims and not a chancy one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5107.691" offset="20534105">We set out the whole argument at pages 63 to 67 of our brief, but let me illustrate the problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="5115.946" offset="20567124">In the court below in the argument before the three-judge court, I expressed some concern that the Government did not recognize that we had to have an adequate Court of Claims remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5129.717" offset="20622190">For example, that the Government did not recognize that the fact that the trustees were trying to accommodate to the public interest and we are trying to accommodate to the statute by keeping the railroad running rather than trying to stop it, would not be urged against them in the Court of Claims as a waiver of their right to have remedy for unconstitutional erosion if that occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="5155.410" offset="20725008">In response, the counsel for the Government gave me that assurance and we have quoted the language of that assurance in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5165.959" offset="20767222">In the briefs in this Court, both in the briefs of the Government parties and in the briefs of the United States Railway Association, there is a suggestion now that -- well, the trustees may not -- may forfeit any right to unconstitutional erosion because they are not diligent in applying for permission to stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="5189.652" offset="20861994">And they sight Section 304 (f) which permits interim erosion with the permission of the USRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="5197.166" offset="20892087">The theory apparently is that unless we apply to stop the whole system and USRA denies us that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5205.115" offset="20923852">We may have waived our right to compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5209.848" offset="20942764">Just -- it seems to me so painted that Section 304 (f), which I will not burden the Court with the dissertation on does not contemplate that USRA would be permitted pending the preparation of a final system plan to authorize the abandonment of the termination of operations in the liquidation of the entire Penn Central system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5234.892" offset="21042970">Indeed, as the Special Court noted, USRA does not really have the power all by itself to do that anyway because any reasonable objection by a state, local or regional transit authority will inhibit USA's permission to make any abandonment's.</text>
            <text syncTime="5255.022" offset="21123427">And plainly it seems to me, no application by Penn Central Trustees to stop operations on the whole system would be entertained by USRA and it would be futile to make the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="5268.238" offset="21176299">If the Solicitor General and Mr. Cutler still share the view that we are subject to that obligation before we can protect our rights to interim erosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5277.837" offset="21214751">I hope the Court will disabuse them of that position in their opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.681" offset="21234082">Now, let me turn to another point as I have indicated, the trustees do agree with the appellees here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.941" offset="21263130">That absent to Tucker Act remedy, this statute can not be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="5294.780" offset="21282461">I don't propose to argue that position in detail because it is adequately argued in our briefs and it is adequately taken care off in Judge Friendly's opinion in the Special Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5305.937" offset="21327078">But I do have a few comments on the appropriate relief, if the Court determines that there is no Tucker Act remedy and that the statute therefore should not be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="5319.258" offset="21380368">I think under those circumstances --</text>

            <text syncTime="5367.771" offset="21574405">I think the lower court in an essence structured it correctly as the Solicitor General said, the first paragraph of the order just enjoin USRA from certifying the final system plan of the Special Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="5430.313" offset="21824658">This is the paragraph of the order that you inquired by Justice Stewart, Section 207 (b) of the Act, which requires the reorganization court in the event that it finds that the process of the Act is not fair and equitable to dismiss the proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="5783.898" offset="23238928">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5789.639" offset="23261915">I regret the necessity of disturbing the congenial set of agreements and concessions with which previous counsel had approached this rostrum, and to take issue with virtually all counsel who have appeared before me.</text>
            <text syncTime="5806.705" offset="23330147">I represent the appellant and the appellees in Connecticut General, secured creditors of the Penn Central Transportation Corporation and we appear in support of the injunction issued below, and the declaratory relief of which it was course of relief declaring the Act in significant part to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="5827.936" offset="23415097">I hope in by taking immediate issue with the notion that the tasks of the creditors or for that matter, the stockholders represent my brother Mr. Berger or for the New Haven Trustee, here again, represent by Mr. Auerbach is to force a nationalization of the Penn Central Transportation Company or to impose a collision with either seller or this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5853.500" offset="23517393">It is our task, it seems to me, to suggest that this particular remedy fashioned by this particular Congress, for this particular set of problems represents a reach in excess of the constitutional grasp of the Congress and we do not mean to suggest that a proper solution to these problems is beyond the width or wisdom of the national legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="5878.807" offset="23618644">The root position that we take and I take it that this now is conceded to be the issue is that if the Tucker Act be not available, the Rail Act is unconstitutional and that it furnishes no assurance that the bankruptcy estates will receive fair compensation, either for the rail properties ultimately conveyed or for the interim erosion sustained until such conveyance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5907.464" offset="23733269">We argue that the Tucker Act is not available on a fair reading of the statute and that the Rail Act in this respect was properly enjoined below.</text>
            <text syncTime="5917.757" offset="23774438">Let me take up initially the preposition raised by Mr. Justice Rehnquist as to whether all these troublesome and questions need to be reached now or whether sufficient to the days the eagle there up.</text>
            <text syncTime="5933.751" offset="23838386">We submit that these questions are right now Mr. Justice Rehnquist, for a number of reasons that I would like to touch on quickly and likely.</text>
            <text syncTime="5941.503" offset="23869419">First of all, as other counsel in particular the Solicitor General has observed, the Act is enforced now and there is nothing whatsoever contingent about the inexorable operations of the Act between now and the date of conveyance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5956.727" offset="23930232">Secondly, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 303 with regard to ultimate compensation, erosion in the interim will be sustained and that is occurring now.</text>
            <text syncTime="5971.986" offset="23991359">The court below found it likely that those -- that that interim erosion would arise to the level of unconstitutionality during that interim period and the protection that we require and the assurance that we require for compensation as to those matters it seems to us matures daily.</text>

            <text syncTime="5989.807" offset="24062621">Well, that I can see that might be a basis for attacking the abandonment's or the anti-abandonment provisions, but why would that afford a basis for attacking the ultimate compensation the fact that interim erosion occurs?</text>

            <text syncTime="6006.937" offset="24131166">We take it together, however, with the contention made here that the ultimate conveyance and compensation mechanisms are sufficient onto themselves to compensate for the erosion which is being endured.</text>
            <text syncTime="6017.507" offset="24173380">And if they are not, then the impact of the interim erosion argues for consideration of adequacy of compensate or mechanism now.</text>
            <text syncTime="6027.865" offset="24214862">Furthermore however, under Section 209 of the Act and under Section 303 (b) (2) of the Act the last sentence, the Act specifically excludes future review of the compensatory mechanisms by injunctive procedures, so that the remedy that Mr. Justice Rehnquist suggested as possibly being available on some future date, is attempted to be precluded by those provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6054.949" offset="24323218">And most particularly the Special Court is given no discretion under the Act but to orders the conveyances upon the certification of the final system plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="6064.496" offset="24361357">If there are any doubts about the statutory intent from that, the Senate reported at page 33, it says it, one little word after the other that the Special Court is given no discretion to withhold those conveyances.</text>
            <text syncTime="6078.934" offset="24419140">The fifth point, I would make on the question of rightness Mr. Rehnquist is that, all of the objectionable features to which all allude in a moment of the Act are no mean knowable now and nothing implicit in the passage of time or what might transpire during the passage of time, can change the legal characteristics of those features of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6101.260" offset="24508374">And finally, we would content that and this is close to the heart of our case that, the constitutional vice of the Act, is that it imposes upon the private sector, the creditors, the stockholders, the unsecured creditors, the entire risk of the success or failure of this operation during the interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="6120.755" offset="24586428">The entire risk of loses in the interim, the entire risk of in adequacy of compensation in the end, the entire risk of the difficulties of obtaining a final system plan that can work, the entire risk of conjec -- congressional rejection or in pass, and it is our preposition that when our property, for the property of the estate in which we have claims is requisition in the public interest for a continued or final operation for a public purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="6150.988" offset="24707323">It is constitutionally impermissible to impose those risks upon us without just compensation and all those risks are discernable now, though, absence of assurance is discernable now and we think, the issue which that risks presents is right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="6173.157" offset="24796035">I've said that the Act precludes assurance of fair value and I would like to tell the Court that I've post to address two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="6183.001" offset="24835427">First, touching lightly in the light of the Solicitor General's concession on why we believe the act is constitutionally vicious in the absence of a Tucker Act remedy and then touching somewhat or heavily I hope, on the question of whether the Tucker Act is there to rescue the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6203.449" offset="24917138">I say, I'll touch lightly on these questions recognizing the possibility that Mr. Justice Stewart raised that the Act could be conceivably considered by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6211.167" offset="24948067">Sustainable in the absence of the Tucker Act because I think the Solicitor General's argument on the point as a quasi appellee for the moment was persuasive and perhaps, sufficient to the occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6223.506" offset="24997386">That in the absence of the Tucker Act the show is substantially over.</text>
            <text syncTime="6228.014" offset="25015463">But let me touch on four characteristics of the Act that it seems to me condemn it as a constitutional enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6237.365" offset="25052871">First, there are no provisions in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6239.891" offset="25062902">I mean, literally none at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6243.297" offset="25076590">That provide for a payment of the interim erosion sustained by the estates until such time as the conveyances occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="6253.536" offset="25117550">And we submit that that imposes upon the estates both the risk and indeed a very likely certainty of unconstitutional erosion on the estate and of the claims against the estate as their interest might appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="6268.929" offset="25179094">The second consideration and I think this is -- it's important to frame this in terms of the about intention, to frame this Act like unto the New Haven inclusion prospect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6284.200" offset="25240221">The Second consideration in that context is that, there are no provisions in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6289.389" offset="25260910">Again, literally none, which create what the New Haven Inclusion case characterized as an intrinsic value for the Conrail stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="6302.089" offset="25311692">In the New Haven Inclusion case, Judge Anderson had after negotiations endorsed in $87.50 per share value for the stock in the Penn Central, nothing establishes such value here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6315.486" offset="25365295">We'll be gone though that assurance was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6319.504" offset="25381386">We have in this situation substantial evidence in the record with regard to the liquidation values of the Penn Central estate and we have maximum obligation or authorities which fall measurably short of that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="6335.099" offset="25443767">And so, we are left with consideration in the form of a package of securities as to which as I say, there is no intrinsic value supplied by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6346.712" offset="25490265">The third feature and this I take it to be conceded as a constitutionally impermissible feature of the Act in the absence of the Tucker Act on page 39 of the Federal appellee brief is that, there is no traditional determination of the fairness and equitableness of the consideration prior to the irrevocable execution of the conveyances.</text>
            <text syncTime="6369.786" offset="25582529">As I say to the Solicitor General, has conceded that that constitutional entitled and exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="6374.745" offset="25602382">The Special Court has rejected the invitation of the Solicitor General to extract such an opportunity in the short time between certification of the final system plan and the maturing of its obligation to convey.</text>
            <text syncTime="6389.329" offset="25660688">And that's the Special Court's opinion on page 68.</text>
            <text syncTime="6393.117" offset="25675839">Not only does this absence of an opportunity to determine an advance, whether the consideration is going to be fair and equitable to the estates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6400.977" offset="25707290">Constitute in itself, constitutionally impermissible feature of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6407.241" offset="25732368">But I think, it radically distinguishes this case from all the cram down Presidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="6413.117" offset="25755878">Most particularly the Rio Grand case and the visitation on the cram down provision which I happen to think is best laid out in Mr. Justice Douglas' dissent in the Sancho Paper case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6428.713" offset="25818258">The heart and soul of the cram down provision is that prior to the imposition of a plan of reorganization upon dissenting interest of shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="6439.677" offset="25862040">The Court upon its informed discretion with the aid of the Interstate Commerce Commission shall determine that the plan is fair and equitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6446.932" offset="25891088">That is shall determine that consideration at a time when it has the power to do something about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6452.653" offset="25913971">And the vice of this Act and the distinction from all prior considerations of cram down is that, there is no judicial intervention to ensure that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="6461.880" offset="25950856">And finally and favorably, there is no underwriting provision in this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6469.334" offset="25980740">The New Haven plan as you will all undoubtedly recall included a deep pocket in which the Penn Central had undertaken to make good any excess of value that might judicially be found in excess of the intrinsic value of the stock or the marketable value of the stock at the time that the stock was received.</text>
            <text syncTime="6494.231" offset="26080319">And at 399 U.S. particularly at pages 486 and following, the opinion of the Court, lays heavy emphasis on the importance of that underwriting provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6507.833" offset="26134653">What that meant was it they're stood behind the commitment of the plan that was presented to you, and irrevocable contractual commitment, to make good on any consideration that might be required in excess of that provided by the immediate features of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="6529.718" offset="26222216">And it is our position that that underwriting provision is utterly absent, deliberately absent, from this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6537.144" offset="26251995">Section 303 (c) which is the compensatory provision of the Act provides the exhaustion of the constitutional minimum of one's rights in a deficiency judgment against Conrail, the point that I will come back to in my discussion with Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6553.700" offset="26318137">But most particularly, the conference report which is set out in the legislative materials furnished to you by the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="6561.854" offset="26350738">At page 56, it makes clear of an -- any further clarity were necessary from the statutory language that the provisions of the Act with respect to the terms and conditions of the securities issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6575.408" offset="26404968">"Shall not include any form of federal guarantee of the value of the corporation stock."</text>
            <text syncTime="6581.670" offset="26430046">In other words, the underwriting provision which this Court found to be essential to the survival of the New Haven plan is explicitly precluded by the conference report and fairly excluded by the statutory scheme here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6596.182" offset="26488142">So, those positions taken separately and most particularly those positions taken in the aggregate, lead us to the conclusion that this Act is valid over the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6608.262" offset="26536417">I speak now, not of the questions of uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6611.063" offset="26547597">I'm not going to address myself to the questions of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="6613.884" offset="26558882">It seems to me that those have been adequately briefed over or will be dealt by my brother.</text>
            <text syncTime="6619.351" offset="26580825">But the point of the fundamental on fairness of the Act in acquiring private property or a public purpose without, and a short compensation upon the hypothetical allegation that attracts the experience of the New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="6637.069" offset="26651669">It's simply wrong as a matter of law and wrong as a matter of history.</text>
            <text syncTime="6645.061" offset="26683643">Now that underwriting, which the statute does not in terms provide and the constitutional deficiency which the Act does suffers is sought to be repaired here by the introduction into the mix of the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6664.775" offset="26762428">The reason why the Solicitor General and the Trustee of the Penn Central, both acknowledge to you quite candidly I think, that the Act is unconstitutional in the absence of the Tucker Act is because they recognized the necessity for that character of underwriting which the New Haven found essential, and which the Act does not appear to provide.</text>

            <text syncTime="6704.827" offset="26922715">The position that you took in that case, dealt with the fairness and equitableness of the plan in the 77 since because it was in entirely voluntary arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6717.964" offset="26975274">We say that the same standards at minimum applied to a situation, where there is no voluntary character to the arrangement but where it's entirely in an exact of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6728.661" offset="27018010">Nobody has negotiated the terms of Section 303 (c), they are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6733.416" offset="27037027">But I think the constitutional obligation of fairness is at least as owners in this case, as the fairness and equitable I suppose it was found there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6744.183" offset="27080077">As your opinion indicated in that Court, at page 488, it would be unfair to require the conveyance of the New Haven assets for what might turn out to be a fraction and their worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="6754.665" offset="27122082">And that on fairness, we think it's the heart of the political ethic of the Fifth Amendment and is applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6764.302" offset="27160534">When we say, when we talk about the availability of the Tucker Act, it seems to me we're in parallel of a certain ambiguity and I want to try before recess to indicate, what we think that ambiguity might be and the nature of the analysis that, I will hopefully address after lunch.</text>
            <text syncTime="6786.668" offset="27250082">There are two aspects to the availability on the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6791.155" offset="27267950">The first is, its legal availability as a substitute for assurances lacking under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6797.814" offset="27294595">A true constitutional panacea as the Solicitor General would set.</text>
            <text syncTime="6802.660" offset="27314030">And the second question arising under the rule of the availability of the Tucker Act is whether as a matter of law of remedy, it is available as an adequate remedy of law sufficient to have required the court below to stay its hand from injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6818.852" offset="27378813">And that raises some different considerations from the issue of pure or legal availability.</text>
            <text syncTime="6826.849" offset="27410787">It will be my contention when we return and I'd say that we're about to leave, that the availability of the Tucker Act is a femoral on both considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6840.949" offset="27467212">That the remedial structures of Section 303 of the Act, do not impliedly repeal the Tucker Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="7011.240" offset="28148381">First of all, let me say that I would like to rely on the area addition and the analysis of Judge Friendly in the Special Courts opinion beginning at about page 94 and footnote 101 on the Hurley case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7024.405" offset="28201044">Plainly, that is the case in which Congress evidenced an indisposition to be beset by damages for consequential liability for consequential damages, arising from floods incident to a flood control program.</text>

            <text syncTime="7119.260" offset="28580446">That's the insurance case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7120.545" offset="28585566">Now both of those cases, it seems to me, proceed in the absence of a remedial provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="7128.735" offset="28618271">This case proceeds in the presence of an exhausted remedial provision and that is the distinction that I want to emphasize.</text>
            <text syncTime="7138.215" offset="28656201">It brings me to the first of the two twin arguments that I indicated that I would make that as a matter of law, the Tucker Act is not available here because there are remedial mechanisms provided for in Section 303 (c) of the Act which are on their phase and by any fair construction in the interplay of Sections, preclusive of recourse to any other remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="7164.213" offset="28760273">The remedies provided by Section 303 (c) are supposed to provide the estates with everything that they are entitled to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="7173.337" offset="28796740">The statutory languages that they are to provide for the recovery of the constitutional minimum, which I take it to be stingy, rather it for that which just compensation required.</text>
            <text syncTime="7186.095" offset="28847731">They command further and this is of importance, regurgitation by the estates of any excess over of the minimum constitutional value.</text>
            <text syncTime="7199.432" offset="28901125">Their exclusivity is hedged about by two other provisions of the Act, Section 209 of the Act which prevents any injunctive recourse by any other Court and Section 303 (b) (2), which provides that no other Court may enjoin the conveyances.</text>
            <text syncTime="7219.253" offset="28980433">So, that this Court that is the Special Court, is invested with the entire scope of remediation under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7228.946" offset="29019199">And that remediation is made by the terms of the Act, coextensive with the constitutional entitlement of the estates.</text>
            <text syncTime="7238.239" offset="29056293">In other words, it is not contemplated by the remedial provisions of the Act that they'll be anything left over to which in a State might be entitled that it could go any place else to recover and the catch all the bag, at the end of the remediation provision, a place where you get everything that you're entitled to if you don't get it from the stock, if you don't get it from the user bonds, is a deficiency judgment against Conrail, and no where else.</text>
            <text syncTime="7269.163" offset="29180008">As I indicated to you this morning, the language of the statute which turns you face towards Conrail for the full remediation of your rights is buttress by the language of the conference committee report which indicated in as many words, that there was to be no federal guarantee of the value of the stock and precludes by inference that which the statute precludes in terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="7294.354" offset="29280737">This arises from no elaborate cannon of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="7298.127" offset="29295888">This arises from a fair reading of the statutory terms and the interplay of the statutory structure itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="7305.916" offset="29327026">And we suggest that the recourse to the cannons of construction advanced to you by the Solicitor General today is designed to avoid the plain meaning of the provisions of the Act and to -- rather than to elucidate an obscure meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="7392.047" offset="29671528">And they were talking it in the context of warnings from the secretary of transportation that if they started talking about takings, they might very well run into an interpretation in this Court or some other that they had in fact affected in a domain statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="7404.919" offset="29723042">So, I think they saw assiduously discipline themselves to the language of reorganization and so carefully tried to track the experience of the New Haven, that they avoided any of the redirect that might have implied in any way, that a right might us accrue under the Tucker Act from which they were precluding a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="7424.024" offset="29799424">I think that's the only fair construction of the purpose and policy of the Act taken at large, part from the provisions of the Act themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="7431.712" offset="29830248">If you look at Section 101, Sub 6 of the Act, it's the last of the purpose on provisions of the Act and it's very clear.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Berger</label>
            <text syncTime="7777.279" offset="31212440">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7780.073" offset="31223620">I represent the Penn Central Company which is the sole stockholder of the railroad and reorganization here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7787.817" offset="31254653">We agree with Mr. Craco's analysis of the Act and we also agree that under the statutory scheme, the entire risk here is being imposed upon the claimants in the reorganization proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="7802.139" offset="31311914">Now, Mr. Cutler has stated that Congress can stir the ship of state in between seller and corruptors But the stockholders and the creditors in this reorganization proceeding should not we submit, take the risk of being torpedoed during that extremely, precarious voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="7824.275" offset="31400521">And these points up the uniquely precarious position of the Penn Central Company as a sole stockholder it represents 160,000 shareholders, a significant portion of whom in Judge Fullam's words do not readily fit the image of sophisticate investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="7843.690" offset="31478157">Moreover, Penn Central Company has a massive unsecured plan conceding $41 Million.</text>
            <text syncTime="7850.447" offset="31505115">And as such under the absolute priority rule, Penn Central Company is at the bottom of totem poll.</text>
            <text syncTime="7858.601" offset="31537821">I would suggest that enter an erosion may hurt some of the claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="7864.824" offset="31562689">But interim and continuing erosion must hurt my client Penn Central Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="7871.038" offset="31587558">In short, Penn Central Company is hurt the first and its hurt the worst.</text>
            <text syncTime="7877.448" offset="31613158">Now, no one in this litigation is contended that Penn Central Company had or has no equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="7886.536" offset="31649520">The trustees figures reveal at the put value at the day of reorganization was some $16, 066 Million of the equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="7895.575" offset="31685674">And as of the date when the Act took effect, this had dropped the $684 Million.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Berger</label>
            <text syncTime="7909.897" offset="31742934">And on the date when the Acts of the facts, it then already drop the $684 Million and using the Solicitor General's figures coming from his brief, he says that, the current liquidation value of the estate of apparently exceeds the valid claims against it by a minimum amount of $1.3 Billion what she contends is adequate to cushion this secured creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="7934.701" offset="31842200">The secured creditors don't agree but it's certainly is not adequate to secure to constitute a cushion with respect to the unsecured creditors or the stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="7946.089" offset="31887757">Now dealing with the past erosion, the briefs and their many, many, many pages on this point, I think this comment is warranted, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7956.291" offset="31928508">The facts are undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7958.577" offset="31937703">Only the interpretation is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="7961.024" offset="31947421">We think that Government's interpretation mistakenly minimizes the past erosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="7966.506" offset="31969364">We would prefer and we think it's correct to rely upon the trustees figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="7971.585" offset="31989739">After all, the trustees or officers of the Court, they certainly have no motive to misinterpret the figures and moreover, looking at the history of the reorganization for the past four years, the trustees have supported in the public interest to continue rail operations of Penn Central even at this huge loses.</text>
            <text syncTime="7991.911" offset="32071032">And indeed, they have steadfastly resisted claimant's attempts to terminate the reorganization proceedings under Section 77 (j)</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="8002.196" offset="32112201">Is that in the position of your client in the reorganization court Mr. Berger that the operations are ought to be terminated?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_berger" startTime="8008.347" stopTime="8632.408">
            <label>Mr. David Berger</label>
            <text syncTime="8008.347" offset="32136756">We have since petition in the Court terminates the rail operation, yes Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="8015.725" offset="32166222">Now, their figure show that the accumulation of post bankruptcy priority claims at the minimum amounts to $745 Million to which they had a very conservative figure of $40 Million for the physical decline in the value of the assets or making a total of $785 Million.</text>
            <text syncTime="8038.926" offset="32259114">Now, we submit by the purposes of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8042.616" offset="32273847">It is not necessary at this time for the Court to quantify past erosion of the penny.</text>
            <text syncTime="8048.957" offset="32299238">The secured creditors say that this past erosion exceeds $785 Million and we agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="8056.307" offset="32328600">The undisputed facts stipulated in this record, may it please the Court, is that $851 Million was lost in the Penn Central rail operations from the date of reorganization to the date of the enactment of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="8074.291" offset="32400488">Now, we submit the clear witness and not in this record to work defining of the court below and the reorganization court that the point of constitutionally impermissible erosion has either been reached or will soon be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="8090.513" offset="32465377">And thus, the case in this juncture, in this posture, presents a question very like that presented in Chicago and Rock island, 294 US 648-677, sited with approval by Mr. Justice Stewart in the New Haven Inclusion cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="8108.642" offset="32537893">That it presents a question addressed not to the power of the Court but to its discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="8114.201" offset="32560149">A matter I submit peculiarly within the discretion of the lower court and a matter in the words of Rock Island ordered by this Court not subject to the interference of an appellate court unless discretion will be improvidently exercised, it certainly no evidence of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="8135.033" offset="32643532">Now I would say that, erosion in the order of $785 Million to 800 Million in the language of Government Attorney Dausch obviously has either in the stockholder's account and on check this continued erosion will not be into the stockholder's attempt or will devour it.</text>
            <text syncTime="8153.751" offset="32718346">Clearly, this record justifies what the reorganization court said and it said that "The creditors and the stockholders of the Penn Cent have exhibited commendable patience and restraint in supporting the continued operation of the railroad during reorganization and it cost of nearly $1 Billion."</text>
            <text syncTime="8175.624" offset="32805909">My duty representing the stockholders I submit, is to try to prevent the wound arising from this massive erosion from having fatal consequences, to prevent the Government from conducting this railroad experiment at Penn Central Company's expense with the result of physically killing Penn Cent.</text>
            <text syncTime="8196.804" offset="32890546">Now, a word about future erosion and I think that's in misnomer, its -- we used that phrase in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="8204.763" offset="32922415">Right now, it's happening as we argued the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8208.053" offset="32935581">This erosion is continuing right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="8210.888" offset="32946970">The enforcement of Section 304 (f) inexorably will cause continued erosion, as a trustee characterize it today, huge loses during the planning period from January 2, 1974 until the consummation of a final system plan if that should ever happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="8231.648" offset="33029935">Now, how long will this be?</text>
            <text syncTime="8233.523" offset="33037458">Well, we now know that it can't be for a period less than two years because of the 120-day extension.Realistically, I think we're talking about three to five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="8243.915" offset="33079045">And I would point it out, that there is no limit to the number of final plans Congress may reject.</text>
            <text syncTime="8249.960" offset="33103182">Indeed, there's no assurance that Congress will ever approve a final plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="8258.651" offset="33137977">It seems to me, that unless there is clear explicit protection against these huge ongoing loses which the lower court as demanded reorganization court estimates would run from between $200 Million per year for one year, $400 Million for two year and if we take in 1976 as part of the planning process, $600 Billion that unless we -- there is clear express -- explicit protection against those huge ongoing loses, resulting from the continued, mandated, Penn Central rail operations, as mandated by 304 (f) that the Act must be declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="8305.696" offset="33326164">Now in looking at the Act, I would say that the suggestion in the Government brief that there is some protects and against this interim erosion is just unsupportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="8315.712" offset="33366183">As a Special Court has held Section 303, just doesn't provide any compensation whatsoever for interim loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="8325.529" offset="33405471">And I find no support for the contention that there is any kind of protection or provision for compensation for interim the losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="8335.651" offset="33446013">References made in the brief to Section 213, but I would point out that this grant provision of the statute provides for a total of $85 Million for all railroads, not merely Penn Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="8351.620" offset="33509857">The Department of Transportation and as shown by the letter of Mr. Barnum attached of the trustees brief say, in Annex A.</text>
            <text syncTime="8360.235" offset="33544338">It dependently takes the position that these fines cannot be used to stem further erosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="8368.063" offset="33575581">In order to get grants, the railroads must agree to maintain the service at present levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="8374.799" offset="33602539">So, no abandonment or discontinuance are all possible to come under Section 213, so that's clearly of no withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="8383.923" offset="33639111">And that brings us then to Section 215.</text>
            <text syncTime="8387.522" offset="33653426">If we looked at that, we find that Section 215 provides only for loans not for grants and these loans are restricted in their use for acquisition, maintenance, rehabilitation of rail properties in the final system plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="8406.690" offset="33730121">No one knows, no one can know.</text>
            <text syncTime="8409.012" offset="33739421">It's totally unknowable now or in the near future what rail properties will be in this final system plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="8417.121" offset="33771813">Total authorization under 215 for the loans is $150 Million for all railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="8424.935" offset="33803160">And I think the use of binocular, the clincher is that the law explicitly provides that any loan under Section 215 is and will be a charge against the estate, so that any compensation that might be given to the estate for the ultimate taking will have to be reduced by amount of a loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="8448.095" offset="33895737">I submit a summary that Penn Central Company interest are already been terribly ruined about a billion dollars up to the first three-year and being eroded at the rate of about $200 million a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="8463.694" offset="33958118">It seems to me, that inconsumable to put the burden of further interim losses on the estate during the two, three, four, five-year period until the final system plan will have been consummated the words of Judge Anderson paraphrasing Camden the New Haven case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8483.075" offset="34035649">The public has had it's buy from June 21, 1970 to December 31, 1973, a huge buy, $851 million of rail losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="8497.981" offset="34095313">I submit that the public is not entitled to another huge buy of four to $600 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="8505.177" offset="34124048">This would bring the total close to a billion any half.</text>
            <text syncTime="8508.987" offset="34139303">It seems to me again paraphrasing Judge Anderson, Penn Central's duty to the public has been more than amply fulfill.</text>
            <text syncTime="8518.363" offset="34176815">If this huge losses from mandated coerced rail operations must be continued, that can only be done to at the public expenses mandated by Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="8532.050" offset="34231568">We associate ourselves with Mr. Craco and with the argument which my brother Mr. Auerbach will make and we say that not to defy the constitutional question is really to decide it and to decide it wrongly.</text>
            <text syncTime="8546.439" offset="34289142">In conclusion, I would address myself to this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="8550.735" offset="34306278">Would not a definitive the size of whole name by this Court that the Tucker Act remedy exists to be a sufficient answer to my fears about interim and continuing erosion, I think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="8565.295" offset="34364583">This Court as Mr. Justice Stewart suggested cannot provide a real response to a money judgment of the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="8577.579" offset="34413693">We can see that whether Congress undertook by this Act to provide that the Tucker Act remained as a remedy is a matter clearly within the province of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8591.584" offset="34469700">It would therefore be appropriate for the Court to determine that the claimants have an effect and subjected to an eminent demand taking for which there's must be just compensation under the Fifth Amendment, but with difference this Court cannot provide the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="8610.100" offset="34543783">If the estimates of continuing entire erosion or anywhere near correct and we submit they are, in three years this with a loan amount to $600 million with the existence of a Tucker Act remedy, afford that kind of assurance which the Fifth Amendment mandates of just compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="8647.027" offset="34691532">I think that this becomes a matter of agreement, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="8650.886" offset="34706892">We're talking about the $10,000.00 piece of property that's being flooded or some chickens like the Cosby case where planes flew to low.</text>
            <text syncTime="8659.663" offset="34742000">There's no reason to believe that Congress won't appropriate the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="8663.233" offset="34756315">But now I think, but realistically speaking and I don't want to repeat what Mr. Craco has urged on the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8669.804" offset="34782542">It seems to me, in the light of a legislative history here that we're going to have some difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="8674.896" offset="34802918">In fact, I would quote the language of Mr. Adams.</text>
            <text syncTime="8679.816" offset="34822666">Speaking of movements I think that is been mass movement of some kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="8684.033" offset="34839489">Here's what he says in his brief, if this Court should decide at this time, that a mechanism of the deficiency judgment against the United States under the Tucker Act is necessary to make this Act to constitutional, the Act must fall since the legislative history of the language of the Act that clear that no deficiency judgment against the US is authorized by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="8705.251" offset="34924335">Now facts this case, therefore in some other case, where you don't have this kind of situation, where you don't have this kind of legislative history, where you don't have this kind of potential very large claim arising from admittedly huge losses, there would perhaps being no problem about an appropriation by the Congress but I submit in this instance there is a very serious fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="8734.552" offset="35041573">And therefore, the only real practical way to remedy this is to send it back to Congress, and give Congress an opportunity to correct the constitutional defect.</text>

            <text syncTime="8826.957" offset="35411153">I think, we all assumed there is no single course of action that appeals to everyone but it seems to be a consensus that an income reorganization in the normal census not visible.</text>

            <text syncTime="8845.799" offset="35486595">You suggest going back to Congress but there's no assurance that Congress will come forth with what you might regard is more generous proposal.</text>

            <text syncTime="8865.124" offset="35563917">Stated by the Government Counsel in the Court of law that Penn Central and I quote "Is an irreplaceable national asset but that doesn't give the Government the right to treated as though it belongs to the Government or the National Government as such right now."</text>
            <text syncTime="8882.231" offset="35632253">And I would suggest, if this location that would occur, if the rail operation would be terminated is so great, that the Congress should have an opportunity to decide what he wishes to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="8897.215" offset="35692231">Now, if Congress says that it just doesn't care and look back this location occurs, then, there are number of practical alternatives including dismembering of that the railroads selling all parts to the different railroads making transactions with regions if not, with the United States but wherever regional authority, which will include the 17 States through which the railroad runs.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph Auerbach</label>
            <text syncTime="8936.215" offset="35848234">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8941.625" offset="35869863">It is fallen into my lap among my brother to discuss with the Court questions of the significant of the New Haven Inclusion cases as they bear upon the issues here and the cause of appeal which the Haven Trustee took in this matter, with respect to the affect of the ultimate conveyances required by the Act which the Law of Court considered premature before addressing myself to those two points, however, I would like to mention briefly as a matter which is a reason during this course of the day, as to which I think the Court would want to be advised.</text>
            <text syncTime="8980.360" offset="36024822">First, the question was asked whether the opinion of the Special Court was appealable and could come before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8989.738" offset="36062333">As we stated in our replied brief here at page 48, "We intend to file with the Court as soon as possible and that will be very shortly, a petition for writ of certiorari under the Ulrich pact."</text>
            <text syncTime="9010.309" offset="36144567">We hope to raise some of the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="9011.924" offset="36151045">We think the Special Court did deal with certain matters in the unconstitutional way.</text>
            <text syncTime="9017.061" offset="36171630">Now obviously, the decision of the Court here and the issues now before it might move out entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="9022.880" offset="36194931">But the fact is we do intend to file and raise those issues with this Court notwithstanding the last sentence of Section 207 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="9031.397" offset="36228995">Another question was asked this morning replies comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="9035.637" offset="36245922">The question was, whether dismissal of the reorganization is a possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="9041.104" offset="36267760">The New Haven Trustee filed a petition and motion under Section 77 (g), which is the prescribed method under the rail reorganization statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="9051.535" offset="36309556">For dismissal of the reorganization and for the part of the Penn Central Trustee's as receivers on October 9, 1973 something over a year ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="9061.547" offset="36349576">That motion and petition were not heard until May 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="9067.520" offset="36373504">They were reheard again by Judge Fullam in September of this year but before and he has not yet active but it can't act now because the Special Court has enjoined a dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="9080.131" offset="36423868">Another ground for a petition of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="9085.075" offset="36443721">The third point which I would like to refer of this nature is a question with respect to Section 207 (b) by one of the justices this morning to which the Solicitor General replied, I think Section 207 (b) is effectively behind us.</text>
            <text syncTime="9102.938" offset="36515088">The fact is, The New Haven Trustee now has pending in the Third Circuit, appeals from both the 120-day findings and the 180-day findings headed by Judge Fullam which have the triggering Sections for the action by the Special Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9120.874" offset="36586872">In which, we argued that an Article three courts such as Special Court is, could not enter the kind of opinions which we call it advisory opinions in the absence of any record as to what the final system plan would be or knowing -- and now what the consideration of the other issues which they dealt with would ever be that's the Third Circuit Court, and Judge Hastie said as the Chief Judge in that Court had notified the parties they would reserve the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="9153.317" offset="36716648">Again, pending decision of this Court because if this Court, in fact, the reverse is the lower court in it's holding that was premature to consider the outcome of constitutionality that would moot those issues as well or couldn't those issues as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="9171.492" offset="36789373">So, we do have three separate things pending which depend on how the Court acts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="9179.627" offset="36821870">Going now to do the questions which I wish could address myself principally namely, the significance of The New Haven Inclusion cases and why the Court should take -- should grant our request on the cross of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="9197.728" offset="36894281">I think it's clear from the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="9203.610" offset="36917791">I can refer for example to the Congressional record of the house from November 8, 1973, where states in the debate in Mr. Adams, "This is a constitutional reorganization proceeding in out of condemnation."</text>
            <text syncTime="9218.877" offset="36978918">And he speaks in that same Section, "The statutory reorganization use in this bill follows that adopted by the Supreme Court in The New Haven Inclusion cases."</text>
            <text syncTime="9228.925" offset="37019042">Now, we think Congress even in attempting to carry out what has been described in his day as a heroic measure was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="9238.514" offset="37057390">They did not understand the New Haven Inclusion cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="9242.394" offset="37072959">It is a decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9244.453" offset="37081213">It is in case in which my file has a long history.</text>
            <text syncTime="9248.850" offset="37098768">We think the Congress, if he had understood The New Haven Inclusion cases, could not have been acted the statute, could not have provided what it did, and we would not be face with the constitutional issues that we are now faced because the attempt could not be more clear whether it be in 104-member motion that was filed in the Court last week to make oral argument here as in my guy curiae that Congress did not intend to see this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="9279.648" offset="37221961">Now in fact they may have, whether they intended or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="9283.063" offset="37235649">But if that's the case, we rely on Youngstown as the basis of the decision here that you can't say that Tucker Act applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="9291.410" offset="37268982">There is anomaly here that Judge Friendly was amused by.</text>
            <text syncTime="9295.051" offset="37283610">We have the Government saying, it's a good cause of action against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="9298.795" offset="37298552">You have the credit to say, "There isn't a cause of action against the United States?"</text>
            <text syncTime="9302.982" offset="37315271">And it comes down, I think to the question asked a few moments ago by Mr. Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="9308.116" offset="37335855">We think and it's a fact that we maybe wrong but we think we're talking about billions and the very idea that the Indian case which was some $40 million to be a President for relying the fact that Congress is our obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="9324.351" offset="37400743">Many, many years down the road and we maybe speaking of a dozen years down the road is something which is creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="9332.567" offset="37433657">We think the Court should not oppose upon us and which, we could not consent to as being the best interest to those people whom we represent as by judiciaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="9342.742" offset="37474304">Because of this melding of these issues, I would like with Court's indulgence to review in some length, the history of The New Haven Inclusion case both before reach this Court and in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9357.457" offset="37533236">The New Haven reorganization proceedings commence in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="9363.890" offset="37558941">Mr. Smith, the appellant cause appellant here is the sole remaining custody of that reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="9372.057" offset="37591646">In 1967, barely six years which in reorganization terms pretty rapid.</text>
            <text syncTime="9378.193" offset="37616097">We were before this Court on the question whether and this is the title of the case of The Penn Central merger cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="9386.106" offset="37647757">Whether in the Penn Central merger cases, certain New Haven bond holders were entitled to insist that their consideration be determined before the merger could be carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="9399.513" offset="37701465">And with Mr. Justice Brennan as I recall that argument, return to counsel for Penn Central and he said, "His Penn Central willing to pay whatever is finally judicially determined."</text>
            <text syncTime="9411.761" offset="37750366">I may at this point, point out the ICC had already made the determination which the creditors were objecting too.</text>
            <text syncTime="9419.204" offset="37780146">And when Mr. Justice Brennan asks that question, counsel with the Penn Central said, "Yes,we will pay whatever the Court determines finally."</text>
            <text syncTime="9427.582" offset="37813687">Thus in colloquial terms, we haven't open-end transaction and the Court refused to grant the request of the New Haven bond holders that the merger be held up, but should the merger can go ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="9441.371" offset="37868857">Now, there's the first mistake Congress made.</text>
            <text syncTime="9443.883" offset="37878888">Congress thought because the Court in the New -- Penn Central merger cases as the foundation for the New Haven Inclusion cases permitted the conveyances to be made required to be made as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="9456.977" offset="37931238">But before the consideration was finally determined that they could do the same under the statute and the statute clearly does that.</text>
            <text syncTime="9463.704" offset="37958196">We don't even know the plan is when conveyance is, until the very moment when the conveyances are made but the New Haven Inclusion cases don't say that nor the Penn Central merger cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="9473.984" offset="37999261">What they say is that, where the consideration must be paid and the parties agreed to be bound to pay whatever the Court determines, it may proceed that's not the case under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="9488.814" offset="38058611">The next phase, it came before the Court and the phase I mentioned was 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="9493.908" offset="38078986">The Penn Central merger was carried out on February 1, 1968 and the next phase come before the Court was the consideration in the New Haven Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="9502.849" offset="38114722">And that's the opinion called "the New Haven Inclusion cases" and in that case Mr. Justice Stewart grabbed the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="9509.487" offset="38141367">Just eight days after the Penn Central had itself filed for reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="9516.181" offset="38168116">Now, this opinion --</text>

            <text syncTime="9516.775" offset="38170520">I can promise you, I didn't write the opinion that they --</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph Auerbach</label>
            <text syncTime="9523.314" offset="38196642">Well, I regret to hear that Mr. Justice because I thought it was mass full opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="9528.499" offset="38217331">But the opinion eight days after the Penn Central when it reorganization, made note of the fact of the reorganization and then had to deal with the consideration question in the light of the issues created by the reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="9547.285" offset="38292564">And what it happen was the case as it came to the Court base upon the ICC findings at the early had been objected to by the bank holders and with the approval of Judge Anderson had a shock turn in its form of consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="9563.541" offset="38357556">Judge Anderson said, "I won't disagree that the stock indeed maybe worth $87.50 a share but I cannot agree that constitutionally the creditors are obliged."</text>
            <text syncTime="9575.494" offset="38405308">Now to assume that it will be worth $87.50 a share at infront of indefinite period.</text>
            <text syncTime="9580.811" offset="38426624">Therefore, I would require an underwriting for 10 years that stock must at some point reach $87.50 so, the shareholders can get out of that would be the New Haven shares shareholders that holding that stock and get out and to caught in the New Haven Inclusion cases is it that's no good enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="9600.183" offset="38504155">It's not good enough, it's just doesn't give the assurance that creditors have in order to be paid properly or to know there going to be paid properly for their property.</text>
            <text syncTime="9610.385" offset="38544906">And the Court remanded the case with that specific question to be determined which was the fashion a payment which in the words of the opinion would produce the proposal liquidation value of the properties which had been conveyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="9627.058" offset="38611571">Now, the next phase of that case and despite on it's an academic thing because we don't have any further decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="9635.392" offset="38644903">But the next phase after that decision which occurred in June 29, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="9642.285" offset="38672488">The phase was Judge Anderson comply add of orders which he thought would tell the Interstate Commerce Commission how do you expect them to proceed on the remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="9652.523" offset="38713448">That was appeal by the Penn Central Trustee's.</text>
            <text syncTime="9655.125" offset="38723897">The Court appeals for the Second Circuit reversed Judge Anderson indicated that the entire amount had to be taken off in connection with the Penn Central Merger because it's bearing upon that and I'll go back to the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="9667.550" offset="38773530">Mr. Smith comply with back to the commission that would have been in the spring of 1971 and at this time, we still have never had a hearing before the commission which ended in order to say, "We can't do this and we know what's going to happen to the Penn Central."</text>
            <text syncTime="9686.072" offset="38847613">Now, this brings us therefore right up to what's happening with this new statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="9691.856" offset="38870810">The New Haven bondholders have now waited 13 years since they were enjoined by Judge Anderson from foreclosing on their liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="9703.773" offset="38918457">They've waited more than six years since the property was required to be conveyed by the commission and approved by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9711.426" offset="38949073">They waited more than four years since the Court determine the final consideration, that's not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="9717.386" offset="38972897">The value of the property in that New Haven Inclusion cases determination has never been questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="9723.362" offset="38996825">That's, that's the value of the property, a $175 million but they waited one of four years to be paid for.</text>
            <text syncTime="9731.310" offset="39028590">If the Rail Act is constitutional, this is what they must cope with.</text>
            <text syncTime="9736.691" offset="39050115">They will not know until 1976 or let me interject for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="9742.525" offset="39073520">The New Haven Trustee has a lien on the property which he conveyed to Penn Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="9748.112" offset="39095777">We have a legal lien, in addition, and our enjoined from foreclosing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="9753.128" offset="39115839">In addition, Judge Fullam granted what he called an "indeterminate lien," indeterminate as to amount so the question would be remained open whether the New Haven Trustees is entitled the more it's just a bond which he holds on the eventual payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="9767.710" offset="39174248">And we conceived that to be an aid of the remand from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9773.466" offset="39197236">But if the Rail Act is constitutional as I say, they won't know the 1976 whether the property which they handle lien on is going to be required to be conveyed to Conrail and if it's required to be conveyed Conrail it gets conveyed free of The New Haven Trustee's lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="9791.293" offset="39268498">And he must then just look to the Penn Central Estate without a lien for the payment from the very properties which this Court said in 1970, the bondholders entitle to have the proposal liquidation value for.</text>
