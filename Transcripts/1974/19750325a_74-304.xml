            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="70.355" offset="384815">Mr. Bader, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="i_walton_bader" startTime="72.513" stopTime="159.167">
            <label>Mr. I. Walton Bader</label>
            <text syncTime="72.513" offset="393383">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.815" offset="406653">This case involves the legality of the fixed commission rates which have been charged by brokerage houses in a security business since the Buttonwood Tree Agreement in 1792 which of course antedates the passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act in the 1890's.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.179" offset="492126">The minimum fee schedules charged by the securities industry brokerage houses, thus, the longest sustained conspiracy in restraint of trade that this country has ever seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.820" offset="562657">In 1792, the brokerage community got under a Buttonwood Tree and they agreed that they would do the following things.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.468" offset="605288">They first would have minimum commission rates which would be charged and that no broker would have the right to charge to meet the fixed minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.736" offset="650324">If the broker in fact charged beneath the fixed minimum, he would be expelled from the exchange so that we had at that time a clear per se violation of the antitrust laws but of course that wasn't the per se violation of the antitrust laws at that time because the Sherman Act hadn't been passed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="159.167" stopTime="161.158">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="159.167" offset="740080">Where was the Buttonwood Tree down in the Wall Street?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="i_walton_bader" startTime="161.158" stopTime="257.642">
            <label>Mr. I. Walton Bader</label>
            <text syncTime="161.158" offset="748022">Down in Wall Street, it was a tree, Mr. Justice Stewart that was I think somewhere around the present area of Bowling Green, Manhattan but I don't want to be pinned down to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.524" offset="809462">In 1890, the Sherman Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.200" offset="824195">That didn't affect the practice of the brokerage community in charging fixed rates of commission and apparently the reason for that was that the requirements of interstate commerce at that time had not been broaden by this Court and the decisions that were passed during the Roosevelt and New Deal era.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.867" offset="902875">And therefore, that was considered to be a mere local problem which would not fall within the reach of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.535" offset="949478">In 1934, the Securities Act was passed and in 1934, the Pujo Committee which was considering the passage of the Securities Acts consider the practices of the stock exchanges which had been charging fixed rates of commission in accordance with the Buttonwood Tree Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.877" offset="1038921">And the -- there was discussion at that time that the fixed rates of commission again because of the restrictive decisions of interstate commerce that had been in effect at that time would probably not go and fall within the reach of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.695" offset="1130141">But now in the securities exchange --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="257.642" stopTime="269.523">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="257.642" offset="1133902">Well, Mr. Bader, what grant of authority was Congress legislating under to regulate the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934, wasn't that the commerce power?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="i_walton_bader" startTime="269.523" stopTime="1018.264">
            <label>Mr. I. Walton Bader</label>
            <text syncTime="269.523" offset="1181445">Yes, that's true Mr. Justice Rehnquist but the question of fixed rates of commission there had been a discussion in the Pujo Committee, that does appear in the Attorney General's brief where that legislative history is set forth where apparently the Pujo Committee had felt that the legislation with respect to Commission rates might possibly be beyond the Commerce power of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.735" offset="1290324">I don't think we have to go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.876" offset="1302862">I think the legislative history amply determines as I will point out in my subsequent argument Mr. Justice Rehnquist that the fixed rates of Commission are per se illegal and that Congress never intended to give the Securities and Exchange power -- Exchange Commission regulatory power over commission rates which I will get to in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.050" offset="1407561">Now, the Securities and Exchange Act basically says that unless there is a specific provision repealing any other statute with respect to the protection of the public and the protection of investors that this -- the Securities and Exchange Act will not repeal such prior statutory enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.500" offset="1513409">However, the Securities and Exchange Act does have a provision in it which is Section -- I believe its 19 (b) and Section 19 (b) (9) and that Section provides that under certain conditions which I will allude to a little bit more fully in my subsequent argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.507" offset="1621452">The Securities and Exchange Commission has the right to fix reasonable rates of commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.853" offset="1658755">Now originally, the proposal that had been put into that Section was to fix uniform rates of commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.222" offset="1700237">The word “uniform” was subsequently taken out and the word “reasonable” was placed therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.551" offset="1741615">Now, it is absolutely clear and I think that none of the other parties arguing this matter will deny that if the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 had not been passed and that if the practice of the Stock Exchanges and the brokerage members thereof in fixing reasonable -- in fixing minimum rates of commission were before this Court at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.994" offset="1863346">There would be no question that there would be per se violation of the antitrust laws involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.655" offset="1898036">We have here a conspiracy in restraint of trade and with a penalty that if you fail to maintain the minimum rates of commission that you become expelled from the exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.868" offset="1970866">However, the exchange is contend and the lower courts in this case also found that because of the supervisory ability of the Securities and Exchange Commission in fixing the various matters in which the exchange community does business.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.164" offset="2064071">Therefore, there is a different method of regulation proposed for securities' transactions than there is in the normal course of commerce and that whereas I, in selling various widgets in the marketplace, must abide by the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.269" offset="2152469">I, as a member of the Securities and Exchange brokerage community do not because there is another method of regulation to protect the public interest namely a Securities and Exchange Commission which is standing over the head of the brokerage industry and ensuring fair dealing to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.876" offset="2246928">Now, Your Honors are well aware of course of the large amount of literature that has been written about the effectiveness of regulatory oversight over an industry and that in general regulatory oversight of an industry is considerably inferior to the regulation by the laws of the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.538" offset="2345566">What happens of course is that the regulatory agency gets its input primarily from the industry regulated whereas the public normally does not have the ability to put that input into the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.881" offset="2410872">But interestedly enough the defendants in this case argue for even a more less stringent rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.317" offset="2444622">They say, “We are a self-regulatory agency.”</text>
            <text syncTime="590.636" offset="2465938">The SEC merely has supervisory authority over our self-regulation and not -- but despite that, despite the fact that we are not subject to regulation such as for example the railroads are, or the airlines are, or the other regulatory segments of the -- are mentioned economy are.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.394" offset="2548903">We're still exempt from the antitrust laws and that is what the District Court in effect found and that is what the Circuit Court in effect found and I submit to this Court that that is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.949" offset="2607208">As a matter of fact, in this particular case, the Securities and Exchange Commission really did nothing effectively against fixed minimum commission rates until this action was started.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.465" offset="2665200">When this action was started, then the Securities and Exchange Commission did start considering the particular problem with respect to minimum commission rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.636" offset="2705951">And the first time around when we participated in a proceeding before the Securities and Exchange Commission, we of course said that that fixed minimum commission rates were bad in connection with the public interest and we present the various arguments to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.212" offset="2768227">The Commission nevertheless agreed to a certain fixed scale of commission rates which the Stock Exchange had requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.360" offset="2800828">We went to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit attempting to review that under the Securities Act provision with respect to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.062" offset="2835623">The Securities and Exchange Commission brought on a motion to dismiss and that was in docket 71-1924 which was before the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and then in effect the Securities and Exchange Commission said to that Court, “We have not issued any order, we've not told the Exchanges to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.752" offset="2918379">All we said is that we wouldn't object to this particular commission rate being in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.687" offset="2942098">And therefore, you have no right of judicial review.”</text>
            <text syncTime="711.984" offset="2951293">This is not an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.283" offset="2956518">And therefore, this does not fall within the ambit of review granted to you under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.038" offset="2995493">So, we went ahead and we went down to the District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.564" offset="3017644">We said, “Well, maybe there are trying to proceed in accordance with the manner of the independent broker dealer's case maybe we're in the wrong court.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.216" offset="3052231">Maybe what we really should do is go after the determination is not constituting an order but constituting a determination which we want to review.”</text>
            <text syncTime="747.844" offset="3094758">We proceeded in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.191" offset="3116178">The SEC promptly filed the brief to dismiss and in -- and as I quoted on page 6 of my brief the Commission in effect said, “However, the question of the type and extent of immunity that may flow from Commission determinations regarding exchange rules need not to be decided in this case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="771.455" offset="3189217">The appropriate form for resolution of that question is an antitrust action against the self-regulatory organization challenging its rules or the administration of such rules indeed plaintiffs recognize that they may seek the challenge exchange rules directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.770" offset="3250448">They have instituted suit against the New York Stock Exchange for this very purpose which is this action which is now pending before this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.035" offset="3287542">The SEC while this action was pending then made a further study of the commission rate structure and based upon the further study, they permitted fixed commission rates to remain in effect and accordance with the proposal that the New York Stock Exchange had submitted and which we opposed in another proceeding before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.665" offset="3386075">And the Commission at that point while determining that their jurisdiction was in effect and that they would on May 1, 1975 mandate the end of fixed commission rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.042" offset="3459532">They nevertheless held that prior to that time essentially the proposal presented by the New York Stock Exchange for maintaining fixed Commission rates would be permitted to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.326" offset="3516688">We again went to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit again, the SEC came in and said, “This is no order, you can't review it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="862.720" offset="3554304">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit without opinion again dismissed the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.364" offset="3584815">And again, we had no judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.372" offset="3600906">Meanwhile, this case was coming along, we went to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals with respect to this determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.672" offset="3634030">The Second Circuit Court of Appeals came along and said, “Well, we feel that the fixed commission rates as under the oversight of the New York Stock Exchange constitute the appropriate administrative regulatory authority and therefore, constitute the “different case” that this Court held to be involved in the Silver case where they held that there was no specific antitrust immunity with respect to the New York Stock Exchange or with respect to matters that the self-regulatory agency carried out but nevertheless, there might be an area of immunity if it was necessary to make the Securities Act work.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.636" offset="3829948">Well, the Circuit Court of Appeals said that this is the different case necessary to make the Securities Act work and they therefore, held that there was no antitrust liability on the part of the defendant exchanges.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.004" offset="3907375">Interestingly enough, the Circuit Court of Appeals said, “We do not say that the petitioner does not have an appropriate form for judicial review.”</text>
            <text syncTime="961.723" offset="3950216">How we are supposed to get judicial review is something I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.661" offset="3965994">We've been in six courts already and we still haven't got judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.657" offset="3985951">Now, I say this to this Court, first, the court has held in the Silver case that the self-regulatory agencies such as the Securities industry does not have a blanket immunity from the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.660" offset="4086053">So that the immunity in each case must be considered on a case by case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.068" offset="4123669">This is not the different case that is necessary to make the Securities Act work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.397" offset="4148955">The fixation of commission rates by the Securities and Exchange Commission is not necessary to make the Securities Act work.</text>

            <text syncTime="1097.860" offset="4494817">But when Congress took the word “uniform” out and put the word “reasonable” in I would think that it would be logical to consider that what Congress really wanted to do was this, they wanted the market place to fix commission rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.504" offset="4565347">However, if the market place for one reason or another didn't do it properly so that the rates were excessive then I think the Securities and Exchange Commission could come in and fix the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.186" offset="4612159">And the reason for it is that the fixation of rates here is not the usual fixation of rates that is provided for in the normal regulatory statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.002" offset="4655417">And the normal regulatory statute, the regulatory agency holds hearings to determine what a reasonable rate is to be such as the Federal Power Act and the utility involved attempting to justify a rate comes in with their cost data, comes in with their fixed rates, their fixed expenses, the public who opposed the rate increase come in and attempt to argue against this and the agency then makes the determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.904" offset="4779029">This isn't the way this is done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.253" offset="4788433">In this case, the Commission has to first ask the exchange to supplement its rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.941" offset="4815182">Then, if the exchange doesn't do it, then the Commission can go ahead and order a hearing and after that hearing can direct the exchange to do it with the exchange then having the right of normal appeal review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.174" offset="4868054">I think that in my opinion for whatever its worth and it's probably not worth very much that the determination here was only with respect to excessive rates of commission and that the minimum rates of commission that were involved here at this point are of course not excessive rates of commission.</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard E. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="1434.572" offset="5841690">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.164" offset="5856005">Subsequent to the grant of the writ in this case, the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 23rd this year adopted Securities and Exchange Act Rule 19 (b) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.306" offset="5912639">This rule prospectively abolishes fixed Commission rates to the public effective May 1, 1975 and as to members or associated members of the Exchanges in what's called “floor brokerage” as of May 1 the next year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.409" offset="5989021">The decision appears in the Securities Exchange Commission documentary appendix at page 109 and I will refer to it from time to time in my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.947" offset="6035205">It concisely reviews the history of exchange price fixing before and after the Securities Act of 1934 and sets forth very effectively the reasons why the problem had not been given attention until the last decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.291" offset="6108557">The position of the United States as amicus curiae is that when Congress enacted Section 19 (b), it created no blanket exemption from the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.757" offset="6166444">Instead, the question of exemption should be resolve by the method defined in Silver against New York Stock Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.536" offset="6205524">Respondent's contention that this method is inapplicable really amounts to a reassertion of the same claim of blanket immunity which they advanced in the Silver case and which the Court rejected in Silver as to the application of the method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.010" offset="6287444">Now, under the Silver test as applied to Section 19 (b) including Section 19 (b) expressed reference to the fixing of rates of commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.119" offset="6339897">The usual antitrust standards are changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.334" offset="6360691">Silver indicates that there must be a particularize inquiry to determine whether exchange rules within 19 (b) are necessary but no more restrictive than necessary to make the Securities Exchange Act work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.349" offset="6428818">Thus, exemption is implied only when in a reconcilable conflict is found as to particular instances of exchange self-regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.952" offset="6471137">Now, this accommodation of the antitrust in regulatory requirements serves to reconcile the statutory schemes rather than to hold one or the other ousted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.375" offset="6512828">It rests on the Court's recognition that the antitrust laws and the regulatory scheme of the Exchange Act are complimentary not antithetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.273" offset="6564446">Now, its application here we think is confirmed by Ricci against Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Merrill Lynch against Ware.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.253" offset="6600391">The question of whether when this method of Silver is applied in this case an exemption actually arises cannot be answered on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.276" offset="6652426">The courts below did not attempt to make the Silver type inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.269" offset="6668413">They found a blanket exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.411" offset="6685027">Now, Silver did three things as I have said first, it defined a method for reconciling antitrust laws and the duty of collective self-regulation which the Exchange Act requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.708" offset="6734242">Second, in Silver, the Court applied the method to the case before it and made the determination in the circumstances of that case as to exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.513" offset="6793383">Thus, whether there is exemption or non-exemption is really a product of the application of the Silver method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.629" offset="6821909">Now, the third thing the Court did in Silver was to state that a different case as to exemption would arise where the act provided SEC jurisdiction and ensuing judicial review of particular exchange rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.679" offset="6886066">So, what was reserved in Silver was not the method for reconciling the two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.213" offset="6924204">That is the requirement for a particularize the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.968" offset="6939251">The Court reserved decision on the effect of SEC jurisdiction on cases where the SEC has jurisdiction and where there is ensuing judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.090" offset="7003721">When the Silver test is applied to particular instances of exchange self-regulation, now, the Court in Silver was fully aware of Section 19 (b) and its relation to the rules of the exchange because in this case, we are dealing with a jurisdiction overruled in the rules fixing Commission rates as listed in Section 19 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.367" offset="7104867">The Court in footnote 16 of the Silver decision at page 364 assumed that under Section 19 (b) the SEC could adopt the rule imposing that very notice in hearing of requirements whose absence from the exchange rules involved in that case had led the Court to the conclusion that there was no justification to support the exemption under the 1934 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.430" offset="7209044">Since the record in that case fully explored the question of necessity and there was no possible basis in which the SEC could find that notice and hearing were not required by the 1934 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.299" offset="7272573">The Court itself resolved the exemption question despite the SEC's reserved jurisdiction over exchange rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.871" offset="7310817">Now, because Section 19 (b) expressly refers to the fixing of commission rates, we have to consider the effect of that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.068" offset="7363688">Section 19 (b) does not authorize the exchanges to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.249" offset="7388348">It confers a reserved or secondary jurisdiction on the SEC over any rules the exchanges may adopt in carrying out their duty of self-regulation which fall within the enumeration of particular matters contained in Section 19 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.442" offset="7461177">In our view, it adds to the panoply of remedies available under existing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.034" offset="7491480">Section 28 of the Exchange Act expressly declares that the rights and remedies that defined by the Exchange Act are in addition to all others that may exist at law or equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.139" offset="7547904">With respect to Section 19 (b)'s reference to fixed commissions, we agree subject to qualifications then I will state with the SEC's brief at page 11 where it says Congress recognized the existence of fixed commissions but shows neither to outlaw that practice nor to endorse it but rather to bring it under the complete control of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.945" offset="7655111">I -- I express three qualifications to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.857" offset="7670784">First, Congress gave the Commission complete but not exclusive power within the purposes of the Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.776" offset="7702444">Second, Congress recognized price fixing as it has existed since 1792 but did not endorse it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.222" offset="7736299">And third, Congress neither condemned nor endorsed whether that recognize so that the fixing of commission rates is thus permitted as a matter of securities law until the SEC acts on the practice as it now has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.943" offset="7807143">But, even though it's permitted under the Securities Act that's not enough, it's fundamental that even though a practice maybe permitted under a regulatory statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.563" offset="7845595">That does not exempt it from the antitrust laws thus, with the power Commission's approval the acquisition of a Northwest Pipeline Company by El Paso Natural Gas was permitted by the Natural Gas Act but it was still subject to antitrust scrutiny as in California against the FPC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.708" offset="7914245">And the banks that merged in Philadelphia with the approval of the comptroller of currency were permitted to do so under the old Bank Merger Act but they still had the postmaster under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.886" offset="7966908">Now, the amici and the respondents have viewed -- have reviewed the legislative history of the 1934 Act at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.003" offset="8007346">What it boils down to is this, Congress knew about commission rate fixing like exchanges but it never specifically considered the practice in relation to the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.878" offset="8058859">I think the history is well summarized in the Commission's decision abolishing fixed commission rates where at pages 116 and 117 of the SEC's documentary appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.679" offset="8106088">The Commission says that Congress was focused primarily upon such obvious evils as corners, pools manipulations insider trading and other fraudulent and deceptive practices which seriously injured investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.769" offset="8166484">With respect to commission rates, there were some concern that the possible overcharging with the possible overcharging of unsophisticated investors and with possible monopoly profits and the Commission was therefore giving regulatory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.862" offset="8234820">As the SEC's report on 19 (b) (3) also shows Congress didn't substitute pervasive public utility type regulation for competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.416" offset="8277034">It just doesn't fit this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.115" offset="8291871">Thus, the assumption that the antitrust laws are ousted because the regulatory scheme leaves no room for them even when a reference to rate fixing cannot be sustained here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.819" offset="8330637">What Congress adopted was a system of private initiative and self-regulation subject to a reserved commission oversight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.022" offset="8367417">Now, where there is a system and which an industry is given collective power to control its own affairs through voluntary commercial relationships governed in the first instance by private business judgment then it cannot be assumed that the antitrust laws are overridden absence some expression by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2223.505" offset="8997386">Well, no, if they -- the scheme of Section 19 (b) is a little peculiar because it does call first for a request from the Commission to the exchange and if the exchange complies with just the request, it's doing so very voluntary, it's not compelled to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.094" offset="9079724">We would say in that situation the necessary to make the Act work would apply, Silver case would apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="2373.827" offset="9598725">With various amounts of weight being given to what the SEC has done in relation to the exchanged rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.539" offset="9633520">I was about to mention the long period which had gone by without anyone challenging these rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.263" offset="9656404">Now, the SEC report on Section 19 (b) (3) at page 136 I think succinctly sum that up also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.849" offset="9698722">It reflects that until the special study of security's markets was published in 1963 everyone just sort of assumed that fixed commission rates were normal and the necessary feature of the exchange markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.404" offset="9752952">Nobody the antitrust division, the private bar, the SEC itself had questioned the assumption either as a matter of economic policy or under the antitrust laws or even under the Securities Exchange Act as the report points out at page 118.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.532" offset="9825468">Now, the special study itself did not address this particular problem of fixed commission rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.446" offset="9857128">But it found that the practice of fixed commission rates was leading to -- attempts to evade them on such a massive scale particularly by institutional investors that the system was not only not working.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.325" offset="9904671">It -- it was harming the industry and this over the years slowly led the SEC to conclude that there was a need to abolish them and it's finally come to that conclusion this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.635" offset="9977919">There's a further argument made about applying the Silver test in the context of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.271" offset="10004459">That is that as a matter of policy it's going to have severe adverse effects on the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.342" offset="10028701">That the administration of the Act will be paralyzed because exchanges will be afraid to carry out their duty of self-regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.432" offset="10061093">Silver has led to no such paralysis nor have there been any kind of flood of antitrust cases challenging every aspect of commission rulemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.225" offset="10112293">The handful of cases have concerned the consequences of price fixing and most to the antitrust problems will disappear with its abolition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.613" offset="10149804">The possibility that exchange rules may be tested under Silver and a Sherman Act suit will have a sagittary effect upon the exchanges exercise of their duty of self-regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2652.955" offset="10715199">It's the antitrust laws as they stand in the Securities Act as it stands without any express immunity and of course the principle it repeals to the antitrust laws by implication from a regulatory scheme are strongly disfavored.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.601" offset="10777788">There are policy arguments that the SEC should have absolute authority in this area that the exchange should be completely immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.783" offset="10806523">But this is not the form and which that kind of a broad contention can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.452" offset="10825226">If it is to be considered, I'd point out that there are some important arguments the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.834" offset="10850722">The possibility that exchange rules will be tested in the Sherman Act suit will have sagittary effect upon the exchanges exercise of their duty in self-regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.527" offset="10889488">There will be stimulated to scrutinize closely any rules involving seriously in a competitive consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.557" offset="10913625">To be certain that they're actually necessary to make the Exchange Act work, the SEC will benefit because the heightened attention to the acts requirement by the exchanges under the stimulus of the Silver test with its attendant minimization of practices that do not benefit investors will reduce the need for regulatory intervention by the SEC itself far from having a chilling effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.306" offset="11000560">Therefore, we think that continued application of the Sherman Act will serve to compliment for a self-regulation under the SEC's reserved jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2750.151" offset="11104005">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, I think I'm not going too far when I say that the position taken by the Department of Justice in this case is nothing less than an effort to exalt the antitrust laws to a quasi constitutional status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.832" offset="11226676">A status in which this particular statute is a far greater force than another later statute passed by Congress with which the antitrust laws are inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.493" offset="11285295">I think this is the most extreme position the department has taken with respect to the doctrine of implied repeal that I know of because inherent in its position that there is no exemption here is that the following circumstances are of no moment whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.652" offset="11377977">First, that the exchanges are authorized and permitted by the Exchange Act to adopt rules fixing commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.067" offset="11419669">Secondly, that Congress created the SEC to act as the guardian of the public interest in supervising and changing if necessary rules relating to commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.728" offset="11478288">Under regulatory standards that are broader than those of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.481" offset="11501275">And thirdly, despite the references to tame regulators as this record shows that the SEC has actively exercised these powers and has been an active watchdog.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.512" offset="11565432">Indeed, major changes seven of them in commission rules of exchanges have taken place in the past seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.627" offset="11605870">All of them at the request or with the approval of the SEC and after hearings in which the Department of Justice participated, all these counts for not in the Department's world of antitrust absolutism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.276" offset="11688521">There can be no antitrust exemption here despite a perfectly apparent head-on collision between the antitrust laws and the Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.734" offset="11734288">And this means that in any case and in every case where a rule of an exchange is challenged under the antitrust laws if this theory would apply there would have to be a trial de novo of the facts even after review and approval and even after modification of the rule in question by the SEC and this would be a trial under the standards not of the Exchange Act but of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.549" offset="11881618">This is to ignore the Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.959" offset="11895202">This is to second guess the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.714" offset="11910248">This is to say that exchanges should be regulated by District Courts with the aid of the Department of Justice and with the assistance of juries rather than by the expert agency to which Congress has created the task.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.183" offset="11972106">With the greatest of respect I submit that this is (Inaudible) run wild and that it was properly rejected by the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.377" offset="12020903">I would submit Your Honors that the question before the Court is that which was left open in Silver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.521" offset="12077432">The different case with respect to antitrust exemption where the SEC has jurisdiction over the practice attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.365" offset="12132812">We submit of course that this is the case, the different case and that its resolution has been foreshadowed in Silver itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.103" offset="12179832">There's no issue here of blanket immunity for exchanges or for all exchange activities as this Court recognize in the Hugh's case a regulatory scheme may not be sufficiently pervasive to result in a total exemption but nevertheless, it may result in exemption in particular and discrete instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.949" offset="12279202">That's all we're dealing with here because the issue here of antitrust exemption relates only to a single aspect of exchange activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.315" offset="12324655">The fixing of reasonable rates of commission to be charge by members as permitted by Section 19 (b) (9) of the Exchange Act subject to SEC review jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.354" offset="12384737">Now, the Buttonwood Tree has been referred to and it is not without significance I submit that commission rate fixing by exchanges has been engaged in this country openly and above board since the Buttonwood Tree agreement in 1792.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.078" offset="12479718">We all know that horizontal price fixing and rate fixing by competitors has been unlawful at least since the passage of the Sherman Act and yet the Exchange commission rate fixing was not challenged by the Department of Justice at all prior to the Exchange Act of 1934 despite this Court's ruling in Trenton Potteries that price fixing was per se unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.039" offset="12607509">And then Congress in 1934 in enacting the Exchange Act an act which we all recognize was designed to correct abuses nevertheless permitted the exchanges to continue their historic and well known practice of fixing rates of commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.953" offset="12707192">Subject however, for the first time to regulation of that practice by a government agency and in giving the SEC jurisdiction to review those rates, the standards established by the Act with those of reasonableness and other standards listed in the Act, the primary one of which was a protection of investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.352" offset="12832789">So that after the passage of the Exchange Act the exchanges were no longer engaging in unfettered rate fixing by custom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.182" offset="12884093">But they are engaging in statutory permitted and government's supervised rate fixing which even the Seventh Circuit in the Thill case with which we thoroughly disagree described as a system of authorized price fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.009" offset="12963401">And so the question is whether Congress by providing for SEC supervised commission fixing in Section 19 (b) (9) of the Exchange Act intended by necessary implication to exclude such commission fixing from the scope of the antitrust laws.</text>
