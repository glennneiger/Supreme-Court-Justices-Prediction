            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">In the third case, the United States against Brignoni-Ponce, No. 74-114, presents an issue about a different aspect of the Border Patrol's operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.076" offset="52245">Respondent's car was stopped on a highway where there was no established checkpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.136" offset="76487">No search is in issue in this case because the passengers immediately admitted that they were aliens illegally in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.177" offset="116611">Because a mere stop, the questioning about citizenship is less intrusive than a search, we hold that the standard of probable cause is not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.291" offset="165094">But even random stops for questioning anywhere near the Mexican border could subject law abiding citizens to potentially unlimited interference with their use of the highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.413" offset="221623">We therefore hold that Border Patrol officers on roving patrol may not stop a private vehicle unless they have reasonable grounds to suspect that it contained aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.102" offset="276376">In this case, the only reason for stopping respondent's car was that the occupants appeared to be of Mexican descent.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.931" offset="315664">We agree with the Court of Appeals that this alone does not constitute reasonable grounds to believe that the occupants were in fact aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.298" offset="353176">Accordingly, we hold that the stop was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.411" offset="369580">Mr. Justice Rehnquist filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.540" offset="382119">The Chief Justice, joined by Mr. Justice Blackmun, filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.908" offset="407615">Mr. Justice Douglas filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.287" offset="425064">Mr. Justice White joined by Mr. Justice Blackmun filed an opinion also concurring in the judgment.</text>
