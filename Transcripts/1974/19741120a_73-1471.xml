            <text syncTime="87.286" offset="452524">Thank you Mr. Justice Douglas and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.858" offset="470810">This case arose on a petition by Jersey Cape Broadcasting Corporation, a broadcast licensee in New Jersey, seeking a declaratory ruling from the Federal Communications Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.830" offset="554715">Jersey Cape pointed out to the Commission that the winning number in the New Jersey State Lottery is selected every Thursday and that many of the listeners to the broadcast station were interested in learning what the winning number was and many of them knew that the broadcast stations were informed of that number on their wire service and were telephoning the station to ascertain the number.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.232" offset="692328">The Jersey Cape wanted to know the Commission's opinion on whether it's proposal to broadcast on three successive newscasts, each Thursday, the statement that the winning state lottery number drawn today is and they recite the number, whether that would violate Section 1304 of Title 18 of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.789" offset="826493">That provision is set forth in the government's brief on page 2 and it provides summarizing the pertinent language, whoever broadcasts or skipping down, knowingly permits the broadcasting of any advertisement of or information concerning any lottery, skipping down three lines, or any list of the prizes drawn or awarded by means of any such lottery, skipping, whether said list contains any part or all of such prizes shall be fined not more than $1,000.00 or imprison not more than one year or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.322" offset="1028681">The Commission in response to this request issued a declaratory ruling stating that in its view, this broadcast, the proposal would violate Section 1304 of Title 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.451" offset="1101197">It based this view on an interpretation of this provision that had been developed in a decision of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in 1969, called New York State Broadcasters and on the Commission's further proceedings on remand in that case which was also a case involving a declaratory ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.951" offset="1207150">In that case, the Second Circuit and the Commission had both held that the statute applies to legal as well as illegal lotteries and applies to not only to advertisements, but also to information directly promoting a legal or illegal lottery.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.452" offset="1321148">The interpretation limiting the words information concerning any lottery was based in part on the face of the statute itself, which goes on to specify or any list of the prizes drawn or awarded which would have been surplusage if Congress had intended to use the word information as comprehensively as possible and I might add that the interpretation also could quite properly be based on the fact that at the same time that this provision was enacted, Congress reenacted the 47 U.S.C. 326, which is also set forth on page 2, guaranteeing broadcast licensees the right of free speech and protection from censorship by the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="538.800" offset="2258526">And it deliberately did so in the course of the development of this legislation in the 19th Century.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.804" offset="2286634">We recounted the history in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.419" offset="2305024">At that time that the word illegal was removed from some of these prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.518" offset="2333445">In 1876, there was a debate specifically on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.472" offset="2357269">There were some who advocated restricting the statutory prohibition only to illegal lotteries and thought that the function was to aid the states in their enforcement of the law against lotteries, but the prevailing view was no that lotteries themselves are an evil even when authorized by state law as the Louisiana lottery was until from almost 20 years later in 1893, and that the channels or the use of the mails should be forbidden to lotteries.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.306" offset="2496554">Now, in 1934, when this provision was enacted, there weren't any legal lotteries in the United States, although there were legal lotteries elsewhere, being conducted elsewhere for which tickets were sometimes attempted to be sold in the United States, and the predominant purpose shown in adopting this prohibition for broadcasters was to put them in the same position as publishers of Newspapers or of circulars who were forbidden to use the mails for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.306" offset="2656632">And Congress drew no distinction on the face of the statute between legal or illegal lottery and there is no reason to read one in.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.385" offset="2696861">The predominant intent was to apply the law as it had been developed with respect to the other lottery prohibitions and this Court held in the Rapier case in volume 146 US and in the Fabrizio case in volume 385 US that some of the other prohibitions do apply to legal as well as illegal lotteries.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.712" offset="2806262">As the Second Circuit put it, Congress had long since stopped distinguishing between legal and illegal lotteries in the lottery legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.819" offset="2850670">Now, there have been since the more recent development of official state lotteries, there have been efforts in Congress to amend the statute to make an exception for broadcast concerning the -- well, the Attorney General testified today in support of an amendment, which would in effect moot out this case since this case is merely a declaratory ruling, it's still in committee and we will keep the Court advised in any developments.</text>

            <text syncTime="1063.261" offset="4356368">Well, that seems to be the implication that it was a unanimous opinion for the Court en banc and in the first place, the opinion draws no distinction between legal or illegal lotteries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.123" offset="4419897">It doesn't question the Commission's holding that the statute applies to legal lotteries and its rationale would seem to apply to a newscast announcement of the winning number of an illegal lottery as much as it applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.036" offset="4487502">Its rationale is based entirely on the fact that this is considered news by the licensee and he wants to announce it on his newscast and that's an exercise of protected broadcast journalism in the Court's view, which the implication is that First Amendment wouldn't allow Congress to interfere with and then the Court proceeded to interpret the statute as not reaching it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.456" offset="4609233">And by holding that the statute applies only to -- well, I hesitate to say only to advertisements, only to promotions as they put it, at the bottom of page 10 of our brief, we have the relevant excerpt restricting the application to promotion of lotteries for which the licensee receives compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.396" offset="4720933">Whether that would include a sponsored newscast isn't made entirely clear but presumably it would not, that would be protected if the sponsor of the newscast with the New Jersey State Lottery Commission, I don't know what the Third Circuit's view would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.575" offset="4785716">But that is the line drawn and perhaps it would be a line drawn between a newscast sponsored by the New Jersey State Lottery Commission, which is known to announce this winning number each Thursday or an announcement sponsored by the New Jersey State Lottery Commission of the winning number each Thursday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.524" offset="4873488">If so, it doesn't seem like a very persuasive line to us if there's a constitutional right to have this announcement made and the licensee is willing to sell the time to the New Jersey State Lottery Commission, why doesn't the New Jersey State Lottery Commission have the right to make it and as the New Jersey State Lottery Commission exercising her right of freedom of the press in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.812" offset="4978604">The implications of New York Times against Sullivan would be that an advertiser is speaking as a part of the press when he publishes an editorial advertisement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1242.198" offset="5072123">There could be a debate about whether when the Commission licenses someone, the Commission is thereby giving him a right that someone else sold broadcast time by the licensee does not have under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.596" offset="5141713">We think not at least in the context of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.853" offset="5170761">As we see the case, it does involve basically a constitutional issue since there Congress deliberately chose to say or information as well as advertisements and its only under the constraint of the constitutional holding that a court would be justified in effect striking that language from the statute and we get our law basically on this subject from the two recent decisions which we think are the closest in point, one the Capital Broadcasting case in which this Court in a summary affirmance upheld the constitutionality of the statutory bar of cigarette advertising on the airwaves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.178" offset="5368038">And the other the Pittsburgh Press case, there both the holding in the opinion dealing with limitations that can be imposed on certain kinds of advertising or which we take also apply to promotional announcements that would not be compensated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.587" offset="5481723">The examples given in the Pittsburgh Press case where that the Court had and no doubt that there could be a ban want Ads proposing the sale of narcotics or soliciting prostitutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.354" offset="5552776">I take it to this would be true whether the want Ad where run as a public service or whether it was paid for by the sponsor or whether it was the newspaper publisher itself that was selling the narcotics and ran announcement of where they could be purchased from the newspaper and it seems to us that this is the basic principle that governs here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.172" offset="5680044">This is not constituted of the participation in a lottery, is not a constitutionally protected activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.289" offset="5716511">It's an activity that can be suppressed by the proper government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.211" offset="5740231">In this case, some states have seen fit to authorize lotteries run by those states but it is still Congress that has the authority to decide what uses are impermissible over the airwaves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.449" offset="5813164">If it has decided that promoting the sale of cigarettes or promoting the sale of lottery tickets is a use to which the airwaves should not be put, this is within the constitutional power of Congress, so long as it doesn't impinge upon the right fully to discuss debate and inform the public about the conduct of the affairs of such an enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.919" offset="5955062">And in this case, it seems to us to be an extreme example of an application of the statute which does not cut off any information to the public because the numbers mean nothing outside of the context of their role in consummating the lottery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.434" offset="6029145">May I reserve the balance of my time?</text>

            <text syncTime="1488.405" offset="6057044">Mr. Justice Douglas and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.451" offset="6073135">This appeal involves solely the questions whether the lottery provision of the Federal Communications Act, Section 304, prohibits broadcasters from broadcasting winning lottery numbers as part of regular news shows and if the lottery provision may be read to reach that far, whether it violates the free speech and free press guarantees of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.423" offset="6181073">Section 304 by its terms prohibits the broadcasting of any advertisement of or information concerning any lottery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.219" offset="6224227">It should be clear initially as I believe as been conceded by the FCC, that this section cannot be read literally to prohibit any mention whatever by broadcasters of information relating to a lottery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.860" offset="6290787">If there were any notion that it could be or should be, or was intended to be read this way, it would be patently unconstitutional because it would prohibit for example even discussion of information about the lottery in the context of an editorial condemning the lottery or encouraging the lottery or so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.097" offset="6375737">So, such and interpretation would be clearly unconstitutional and for that reason, the FCC has conceded that a strict literal reading on the statute would be inappropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1662.045" offset="6751587">That of anything might exacerbate the First Amendment problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.831" offset="6770709">Certainly, it would cut off people who have an interest in the lottery, cut them off from all information about lottery and I would think for that reason it would not -- it would make the problem even more severe perhaps but that is the theoretical, there are many other sources of information as to the winning lottery number, including the newspapers for one as well as postings at various lottery locations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.357" offset="6896828">If it is once conceded that a literal interpretation of 1304 is inappropriate then the question becomes what does this section mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.610" offset="6953775">I think in addressing ourselves to that question, it is important to bear in mind that there were no legal lotteries at the time Section 1304 was included in the Federal Communications Act and it is therefore clear that even if 1304 may be said to be addressed to legal lotteries as well as illegal lotteries because the distinction is not specifically drawn in the statute, that nonetheless it must be read in a manner consistent with the setting in which it was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.836" offset="7126706">And by this I mean that at that time in 1934, there could have been no conception in the minds of the members of Congress that there would be a legal state lottery which would be at such widespread public interest that there might be the type of public demand for the winning lottery number that could lead the broadcast news media in the exercise of its editorial discretion to conclude that there was a public demand to know the winning number and that therefore it should be included as part of a regular news show.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.441" offset="7297128">I think secondly that 1304 must be construed in light of Section 1302.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.514" offset="7337462">The FCC has urged this point in stating that 1304 applies to legal as well as illegal lotteries and we are not disputing that point, but I think that the -- if the FCC is going to rely on 1302 for that conclusion then it is also fair for us to rely on 1302 for the further conclusion that the newspapers, that there is no prohibition and has been no prohibition in the past on the newspapers including as part of the news article the winning number in a lottery and for those newspapers to be sent through the mail.</text>

            <text syncTime="2593.925" offset="10479052">The second basic exception to First Amendment protections which is relied upon by the FCC are those cases dealing with communications in furtherance of illegal activities such as mail fraud schemes or misrepresentations in advertisements that maybe endanger the health of purchasers of consumer products.</text>

            <text syncTime="2683.263" offset="10836407">The Federal Government has imposed certain restrictions such as that contained in 1304 whatever it may mean, but in other instances it is permitted, Federal Banks for example, to handle the record keeping and handling of money in connection with the lottery.</text>

            <text syncTime="2710.452" offset="10945181">Therefore, in any view of the First Amendment, the restriction that the FCC has expensed in interpretation in 1304, imposes on broadcasting could only be sustained if there were some overriding public interests, but the FCC has not urged even any significant public interest in their brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.538" offset="11065553">They merely made the conclusionary statement that lotteries are suppressible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.269" offset="11092407">The point is that they haven't been suppressed, that they are legal and that the broadcast news media in its editorial discretion has concluded that there's sufficient public interest that the public should be advised as to the results of the lotteries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.722" offset="11178297">For this reason, the communications enjoy First Amendment protection and if the Court finds that 1304 must be interpreted to reach this type of communication and we submit that it doesn't have to interpret 1304 in this manner then that statute would be unconstitutional in these applications.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="3048.103" offset="12295816">Because, well, our -- many people think that the lottery statute are outmoded insofar as they apply to legal state's sponsored lotteries and that question is pending before a Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.869" offset="12354853">The Attorney General has testified that he thinks they should be amended, but the Congress has adapted a policy judgment here which in the view of many may be quaint now, but it's still entitled to the respect of the Department of Justice and of the Federal Communications Commission in our view of the Courts because it was a permissible policy judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.017" offset="12439489">It was based on determinations spelled out in some detail, if you'd like a citation in four Congressional record 4261 to 4264 that lotteries are injurious to people even if they are legally sponsored and therefore the word illegal should be removed from the statute and that view prevailed in Congress and most states today do not permit lotteries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.728" offset="12542307">There are still a large body of opinion in this country that believes lotteries are injurious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.076" offset="12579715">And there some suggestion has been made that even though an activities are protected by the First Amendment, a broadcast on a newscast might be protected by the First Amendment, this would be our right because the Commission nevertheless, could in applying the public interest limitations on licensees discipline the licensee for engaging in such a broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.025" offset="12691519">I find this a little hard to imagine that the Commission applying the sanction for an action that is constitutionally protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.113" offset="12731852">If it is constitutionally protected to broadcast the number -- the winning number of an illegal lottery, why is that then a basis for Commission discipline?</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.767" offset="12770408">I have thought that from Pittsburg Press and Capital Broadcasting that it was fairly clear that it would be -- or it could be government could prevent a broadcaster from announcing daily on a newscast where is the best place to buy narcotics today in a way similar to the announcement of where the traffic is flowing better, or which bridge is from the helicopter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.823" offset="12882631">It seems to me that was the implication of those opinions in that the First Amendment issue is not of such difficulty here as to justify tampering with the plain words of the statute and the intent in history behind them.</text>
