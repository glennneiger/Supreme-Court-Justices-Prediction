            <text syncTime="50.105" offset="303835">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.309" offset="316583">This is an appeal from an order issued by a three-judge federal court for the Western District of Texas sitting in Austin, which held the multimember district scheme embodied in the Texas plan for reapportionment, unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.437" offset="373112">The State of Texas believes that the plaintiffs in this case have failed to produce evidence which meets their burden of proof such as would warrant the suspension by a federal court of multimember districts, a policy consistently utilized in the Texas system of appropriation for its State House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.006" offset="455346">We are not here to debate or to defend the merits of whether or not single-member district should be used or multimember district should be used, but rather viewed from the constitutional perspective, set forth by this Court, that is a decision which at this point should be left to the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.332" offset="524727">Because the record in this case simply does not support the proposition that multimember districts have resulted in a loss of access or in less opportunity of a minority group to participate in the political processes leading to nomination in election, and therefore does not support the action taken by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.189" offset="608110">We are asking this Court to reverse the court below because that decision was based on incorrect constitutional standards, evidence insufficient to support the correct constitutional standards as well as the erroneous standards used, and the failure of the court to afford the Texas legislature, the opportunity to function it -- to exercise its proper function of reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.331" offset="704658">The weakness of the plaintiff's case and the opinion of the majority below, particularly in dealing with the evidence before the Court is strikingly shown by the well-reasoned and exhaustive dissent of Judge Wood.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.556" offset="757635">Judge Wood, as you may remember, only two years before, clearly agreed with the other two members of the panel that adequate and sufficient evidence was presented to the court to invalidate the multimember districts for Dallas and Bexar counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.655" offset="822000">This Court has consistently and repeatedly insisted that the challenger of multimember districts produce evidence which is sufficient to show that because of the multimember district, members of the minority group within the district are afforded less opportunity to participate in the political processes, leading to nomination in election, thereby minimizing or canceling out the voting strength of the racial or political element within that district.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.247" offset="980407">Basically, Your Honor, that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.027" offset="987512">It was the multimember districts throughout the scheme.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="233.271" offset="1036413">But if relief was given in each -- if all of the multimember districts were made single-member districts, nothing would happen to all the other districts in the state.</text>

            <label>Ms. Elizabeth B. Levatino</label>
            <text syncTime="243.516" offset="1077478">That is correct, Your Honor, depending on how the single-member districts were created.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.932" offset="1095137">Additionally, the court below did find racial gerrymandering with regard to Galveston, which would require an actual redistricting not on the basis of multimember, single-member districts, but a changing of the scheme in that area which could have a domino effect to affect the entire reapportionment scheme.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="269.361" offset="1180818">Why was this multimember district issue, since it affected only certain localities in the state?</text>
            <text syncTime="277.783" offset="1214464">Why was it a three-judge court issue?</text>

            <text syncTime="280.796" offset="1226585">Your Honor, I believe that one of the major reasons that it is a three-judge court issue is that this case attacks all of the remaining districts which is a statewide policy, and as this Court has so recently held in Chapman versus Meier, subject matter of this kind is regular grist for the three-judge court, and that route typically has been employed under conditions similar to those present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.615" offset="1325850">And, of course, this Court took jurisdiction in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.459" offset="1357197">It maybe different, Your Honor, but I don't believe that the posture of this case is attacking just one or just another.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.529" offset="1385514">It really is attacking the policy decision of the Texas legislature to utilize multimember districts et all.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.989" offset="1415293">These district range from two multi -- two members up to 8 -- up to 9 members; it's the whole policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.289" offset="1444551">And all of them -- all of the multimember districts without exception were under attack on this remand?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elizabeth_b_levatino" startTime="342.082" stopTime="441.775">
            <label>Ms. Elizabeth B. Levatino</label>
            <text syncTime="342.082" offset="1471718">Yes they were, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.156" offset="1476002">I believe it -- I do not want to mislead the court at trial plaintiffs conceded that they could not find evidence of discrimination in one of the two-member district which was Hidalgo County and they changed the challenge in Galveston County from a challenge to the multimember district to the racial gerrymandering challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.080" offset="1555728">Although, the pleadings initially challenged all of the multimember districts that remained in the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.174" offset="1592090">It is the lack of access or opportunity to participate in the political processes which must be shown, yet the majority below saw fit to devise another new kind of test.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.531" offset="1641514">This test can't be supported by the opinions of this Court nor by basic logic, neither can it be used to bootstrap a record which would otherwise be insufficient to sustain holdings of unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.107" offset="1695848">This new test consists of an aggregate of four factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.642" offset="1709955">These factors are restricted access of the minority to the slating process of particular party nominations, the consistent use of racist campaign tactics to defeat minority candidates or those champion minority concerns, the indifference or hostility of the district-wide representatives to particularize needs of the minority and the inability of minority groups to obtain representation in proportion to their percentage of the population in the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.517" offset="1817475">As set out in our brief we believe these factors operate primarily in a “get one win three” manner, therefore, always adding up to an aggregate, but beyond that I'd like to consider each factor individually, beginning with this--</text>

            <text syncTime="445.798" offset="1886542">By that I mean, Your Honor, if you look at the three factors if you could find that there was no access to the slating process--</text>

            <label>Ms. Elizabeth B. Levatino</label>
            <text syncTime="453.449" offset="1917158">You automatically get the other two, so it adds up to three and thereby you win the game.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="457.487" offset="1933354">I think they are not distinct or separate?</text>

            <label>Ms. Elizabeth B. Levatino</label>
            <text syncTime="460.529" offset="1945475">Independent, they are functions of each other, basically.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.076" offset="1959685">Beginning with the factor regarding the election of a minority group in proportion to their population of the district, I believe this factor has previously been rejected by this Court in Whitcomb and more recently in Chapman as evidence of non access.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.381" offset="2020916">Indeed, the record in this case actually reflects that in two of the districts, Nueces and El Paso, members of the minority group have been consistently elected in the past decade to the House of Representatives as well as to other district-wide governmental races.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.848" offset="2082774">In the 1968 and 1970 elections, Nueces sent a delegation to the House which consisted of Representative Truan, a Mexican-American, Representative Hale, an honorary member of the Mexican-American Group and Sissy Farenthold widely known for her interest and concern for the minority people.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.203" offset="2160201">In the latest election, a third district Travis elected two members of two different minority groups to two out of four seats and that delegation is now composed of its dean Sarah Waddington a 30-year-old woman, a Mexican-American, Gonzalo Barrientos, who this time beat the then 17-year Anglo incumbent, Mrs. Delco, the Black woman who the majority characterized her election, early election to the school board as a distortion in the voting pattern and finally a 32-year-old male Anglo.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.867" offset="2302830">Now no one can guarantee that this pattern will continue, but then no one can guarantee that it won't continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.466" offset="2333236">At the very least, it is, and I believe, should be considered as strong evidence that minority groups do have access to the political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.766" offset="2370435">Furthermore, while the plaintiffs in the court below were taking great pains to emphasize the relative failure of the minorities at the ballot box since reconstruction, the record also was reflecting that minority groups, both leaders and individuals, endorsed and voted for non minority candidates, thereby electing many of these candidates and making them their -- legislators of their choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.151" offset="2484015">Proceeding to the next factor, the indifference or hostility of the representatives to the particularized minority interest, this too has never been referred to by this Court --</text>

            <text syncTime="634.361" offset="2640854">And each time all but three, all but the three Negroes are elected, and when the party slates all ten Anglo, they all ten win, this party is clearly in a majority, let's assume, that slates the three.</text>

            <text syncTime="722.896" offset="2994970">But I believe you also have to look to why some of these candidates were not elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.448" offset="3017122">I believe that as you well know the function of election includes issues, personalities, many things, other than merely Blacks only voting for Blacks and Whites only voting for Whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.162" offset="3064038">In the county, I believe, you're referring to, Mr. Bobby Webber (ph), received 48% of the vote in that particular multimember district, the Tarrant County district.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.781" offset="3106461">Now that certainly shows that he got more than just the Black votes in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.637" offset="3133942">I think that would be a very close question, but I do not -- I think that the question is that close in these districts as the hypothetical which you presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.614" offset="3177827">With regard to the ability to represent the minority, this also has been rejected as significant or has never been affirmatively said to be significant in evaluating the particular access to the political process, but the court, even if it were relevant, the court below didn't really apply this factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.543" offset="3257553">They applied their own factor, which required some kind of legis -- affirmative legislative action on behalf of all the members of the delegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.389" offset="3304887">The reason for this change was that the record generally reflected non hostile or even sympathetic voting records in some districts, clear concessions of excellent voting records and certainly, sympathy for the needs of the minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.972" offset="3367267">In one county, the majority went even further from its pronounced test by finding that a delegate was deficient because he could not empathize with the minority, even if he could sympathize with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.518" offset="3421393">This is only one more example of the weakness of the plaintiff's case and the obvious attempt by the majority to provide that which the plaintiffs did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.298" offset="3460577">The third factor, of course, is the consistent use of racist campaign tactics, a policy or a strategy, which we all deplore.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.584" offset="3493700">But again, which this Court has never related specifically to the issue of access.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.170" offset="3516061">The mention of it in declaring Dallas County multimember district unconstitutional, included the inference that such tactics must be successful, an element now discarded by the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.215" offset="3568201">Additionally, as pointed out by Judge Wood, the few cited instance of the use of such tactics, a whisper campaign in El Paso for a mayor's race or school board races in the 50s and 60s in Nueces County, this kind of evidence hardly rises to the level of consistent and certainly not to the level of proof required in a case of this nature.</text>

            <text syncTime="1094.796" offset="4482591">This Court has said you have to show denial of the opportunity to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.117" offset="4503803">The fact that a racist campaign tactic is used does not say that the minority group in question is not participating in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.389" offset="4544972">It maybe noted, it may go into the totality of circumstances, but in and of itself, it is not a grounds for declaring a multimember unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.934" offset="4611114">The final factor is the restricted access of the minority to the slating of candidates for party nominations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.922" offset="4635042">This, we believe, is a valid factor and we believe it's the only one which this Court has heretofore approved and set out is something that should be shown, in fact, must be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.687" offset="4678092">However, it should be pointed out that while Texas much has been made that the fact that Texas is a one-party state, the primary elections and activity prior to the primary election reflect just as intense political battles between conservatives, liberals, business labor as is reflected between the major parties in any other states and I believe, you must view the slating procedure in that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.730" offset="4778297">The record reflects that in only two counties, Tarrant and Jefferson are there any cognizable, formalized groups which consistently endorse candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.175" offset="4816123">Minorities have received that endorsement in both counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.848" offset="4830751">This is a far cry from the situation found by this Court to exist in round one of this particular case where virtually complete control over the candidates and political processes in Dallas County was exercised by the Dallas Citizens of Responsible Government, the DCRG.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.090" offset="4903685">Additionally in this case, the record shows that endorsement of any one group in any one district is not tantamount to election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.747" offset="4938376">However convenient, this checklist approach of the majority maybe, it cannot be supported by the record nor by the constitutional standards set out by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.565" offset="4981635">This Court in fact has never utilized a checklist and inferentially rejected its use in Whitcomb as the dissent of Justice Douglas showed, all of the factors which were previously set out in Burns versus Richardson were existing in the Whitcomb Indiana district and yet it was upheld as constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.090" offset="5067734">Furthermore, the districts in questions are smaller than any heretofore invalidated by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.671" offset="5094066">These districts range in size from one electing only 6% of the Texas House of Representatives down to ones electing barely 1% or 2 out of 150 members of the Texas Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.521" offset="5153416">This simply is not a case involving extremely large districts electing a high percentage of legislative representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.352" offset="5188733">The State of Texas believes that whether or not single-member districts are desirable in any of these districts, and if so, the specific design of the districts are political questions at this point and are not constitutionally required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.154" offset="5247979">The Texas Legislature does not act in the area of reapportionment only one pushed and pulled by a Federal Court, although their actions maybe subsequently challenged, and at least in this decade were two-for-two on that score.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.895" offset="5302941">In fact, the legislature meeting in regular session right now, for the first time since this Court issued its opinion in round one of White versus Regester is today this Wednesday, conducting a hearing on two single-member district Bills for Tarrant County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.266" offset="5368456">Single-member district Bills have also been introduced for other counties and are being drafted for the remainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.237" offset="5392280">On the basis of the record in this case, on the erroneous constitutional standards used by the majority and on the failure of the court below to afford the Texas Legislature its rightful opportunity to reapportion, we ask that the decision of the District Court be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1346.410" offset="5489037">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.899" offset="5510980">This case involved on remand the challenged nine multimember districts existing in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.784" offset="5538461">As it now stands, seven of those districts were invalidated under the Principles of Regester and are here before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.353" offset="5572733">I, Mr. Gladden, with whom I am sharing time is going to discuss Tarrant County District, I am going to attempt to discuss the ballots.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.800" offset="5614529">From 1900 to 1966, no Negro citizen of Texas was a nominee of either the Republican or Democratic party for any public office in Texas, any elective office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.919" offset="5671058">It was not until 1966 that a Negro for the first time was elected to the Texas Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.067" offset="5695613">One of those is now serving in Congress, and that's Congresswoman Barbara Gordon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.342" offset="5716720">When I came up yesterday on the airplane, I picked up the current Atlantic Monthly to go outside the records for a moment, which devoted this month to Texas and there is an article by Ms. Jordan in it, and she says what I think is quite accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.246" offset="5772309">Until this Court decided to get into apportionment, there was no chance in Texas or in the South for blacks to be elected to office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.647" offset="5814000">It was only when Harris County as a consequence of this Court's decision requiring one-man-one-vote in both houses of legislature, required re-districting in Harris County that she had an opportunity to be elected to office, and frankly that situation remained unchanged until this Court decided Regester last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.416" offset="5901040">With the advent of Regester, and the effect of single-member districts in Dallas, Bexar, and Harris County now there has been a dramatic increase in both Black and Mexican-American representation in the Texas Legislature and as we see it, it solely is attributable to this Court's involvement in reapportionment litigation, and we would hate at this point to see a retreat very frankly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.165" offset="6004067">The contrast with Whitcomb is just that I think which Justice White alluded to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.815" offset="6026637">In Whitcomb the Court characterized a typical legislative race as a head-to-head race between two opposing parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.586" offset="6057671">In Marion County, Indiana if the Democrats won, typically the Ghetto would have adequate representation if I recall the language, that simply not the case in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.328" offset="6100720">Texas is a one party state which we have majority place system, all races are determined in the primary, and what it results in is a head-to-head race with the minority candidate pitted against an Anglo candidate and the result has been almost without exception, defeat to the minority candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.765" offset="6178461">This Texas is peculiar in several regards and this is a special system, but the result has been clear, as the virtual exclusion for minority elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.519" offset="6237497">We have today what we think to be just simply the sequel to the Bexar and Dallas cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.695" offset="6266128">In some cases, it seems to me, in some of the counties, the evidence is stronger than it was with respect to Bexar or even in Dallas, that is with respect to some of the counties before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.164" offset="6304057">The record is at this point something like 14 print volumes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.781" offset="6318477">The original seven volumes of the Regester case together with I think, additional six printed volumes today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.086" offset="6351705">For example, we would suggest that the plight of the Blacks in most of these counties is significantly worse than it was for the Blacks in Dallas county, because at least in Dallas, there was sort of a white man's burden assumed that they would occasionally slate a black, put him on the ticket, have him elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.511" offset="6421400">In Jefferson County for example, that's never been the case, and it looks to me as if it never will be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.750" offset="6446373">There the testimony is that politics in that county been dominated by “The arm of Texas AFL CIO” and that slating by Cope was tantamount to election.</text>

            <text syncTime="1706.692" offset="6930160">And unlike Bexar County, where there was no suggestion of racial campaign tactics ever being utilized, there is evidence that they regularly utilized and these are counties to defeat Mexican-American candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.982" offset="6991287">Granted there maybe a First Amendment Right to utilize racial campaign tactics, but our concern is how does a multimember district operate on minority access and it's our view that this is a relevant consideration that this four, in fact four ordains lack of success by the minority candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.239" offset="7088358">Although, we're dealing with six counties, and they are each different and each I suppose had a particularized appraisal by the Trial Court, there are some similarities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1765.250" offset="7164322">The one pattern that emerged in at least three of the places we looked at was a re-occurrence of a certain theme that is when minority candidates threaten success at the polls, the game was changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.696" offset="7226180">In Waco, the first time a black candidate ran for city counsel, at that point Waco had a ward system, that's actually a single-member district system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1811.166" offset="7348015">First time, the Mexican-American candidates there seriously threatened the School Board elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.012" offset="7367450">They moved from a plurality to a majority system and what we are really saying I think in parts that this at large majority place system, links up in a very real way to deny access to minority candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.003" offset="7419382">I think that's precisely what the court found the first time; that's what this Court found when it affirmed unanimously Regester and we think it's the same case again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.343" offset="7472776">To the extent, at one stage, the dissent suggests that part of our burden is to prove that these districts were designed to disenfranchise minority candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.640" offset="7525961">I take it that means that we must show an unlawful motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.606" offset="7541844">We do not think that's the proper equal protection test, but to the extent that, that's the test or to the extent that, that's our burden; the evidence is here just as it was before, that is, it's the same record, it's the same people acting, it's the same action of the Legislative Redistricting Board that created the districts that are now before the court, that were here before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.948" offset="7623137">It seems to me at least that one thing comes through quite clearly, the Texas Supreme Court said in Mauzy versus Redistricting Board that the Legislative Redistricting Board in structuring these districts should consider carefully whether any multimember district might result in discrimination against minority candidates and yet the testimony is quite clear that the Legislative Redistricting Board totally ignored this question and indeed, one member of the Board characterized the appearance and testimony of the minority candidates with an effort there, the profane effort there and characterized it as being ignored entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.360" offset="7776841">So I suppose one can assume that they intended the logical consequences of their act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.210" offset="7800247">They did not undertake to consider the impact upon minorities and in so doing, it seems to us, supplied the necessary motive if in fact, it was a requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.016" offset="7847476">I have one or two sides about how deeply embedded the state policy is with respect to multi-membered districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.016" offset="7879450">There is one oddity in this case to me, that is with respect to McLennan County, one of the smallest ones involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.433" offset="7909125">When the legislature redistricted McLennan County in 1971, it created two single-member districts in McLennan County.</text>

            <text syncTime="1986.733" offset="8050291">Years ago, that was larger and had four representatives to its -- but anyway, when the legislature came to deal with it in 1970 after the census, for the first time, the legislature cut it into two single-member districts, and then it was the Legislative Redistricting Board after they were impelled at that they reconstituted the multimember district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.899" offset="8126986">And this is what the same see-saw comes to because the legislature did not create single-member districts in Harris County, it created three districts in which representatives ran I think 6 in one, 7 in another, and it was the Legislative Redistricting Board that constituted single-member districts there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.775" offset="8198457">So from the top and the bottom of the spectrum, you have sort of wavering policies review it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.791" offset="8226565">Finally, it seems to us that one question that is in the case that I want to speak a moment to and that's the matter of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.986" offset="8263346">The state argues and I guess by virtue of the state that was granted here; there must be maybe some concern because the court implemented its own plans or the plaintiff's plans for the single-member districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.632" offset="8309948">We think of the circumstances, it was entirely proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.621" offset="8321860">As the record reflects, the Trial Court ordered the state, didn't order the state, requested the state to produce any proposed redistricting plans that it had by January 18, 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.262" offset="8364387">The state produced no plans by that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.098" offset="8371806">The court then scheduled a hearing for January 28, at which time the question of what remedy was going to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.793" offset="8402526">At that point, the state did appear and adopt certain plans, but with respect to the six counties that we are concerned with, I would like to point out that with respect to McLennan County and Travis County, and El Paso County, the state offered no plan in opposition to plan offered by the plaintiffs, in effect acquiesced in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.659" offset="8477968">In Nueces county, the state affect, adopted two plans, said either one was satisfactory; one of those plans being the plan proffered by the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.642" offset="8521958">Only in Lubbock and Jefferson County that the state offered plans in opposition to those proposed by the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.635" offset="8549961">And in both instances the state plan was less faithful to the state policy than the plaintiff's plans because in each instance, the state plan would have required redrawing adjoining single-member districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.675" offset="8610043">Thus, in Jefferson County, they would have restructured not only the multimember district, but altered single-member districts that were abutting it on either side, which were not even in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.879" offset="8658840">The same pattern emerged in Lubbock County where they sponsored the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.564" offset="8669602">The state's plan would have required not only creating the single-member district, but alteration of adjoining single-member district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.458" offset="8697187">So we would suggest to court, the trial court in adopting our proposals was more faithful to this Court's decision in Weiser versus White, that is because the plans we sponsored were faithful to the state policy, did not in fact intrude upon the adjoining districts and for that reason clearly no abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.561" offset="8781615">Further, the plan sponsored by the state in Jefferson County, assuming that the concern of the case was to enfranchise or disenfranchise Negro minority of that city or that district, the state's plan would have drawn the Negro population of Jefferson County into four nice slices, 20% each of the four districts which would have it seems to me would have worsened the situation where now they constitute 30% of the multimember district under the state's proposal they have been reduced down to roughly 20 to 25% in each of the four proposed single-member districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.213" offset="8936260">We do not -- it's our view if the record as I say is exactly the record that we presented to this Court in the first round.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.821" offset="8982653">All of the same evidence is here, we have gone back and done exactly what we did the first time around, developed evidence on a local basis of how the multimember district operated in fact in those counties upon the minority of those counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.035" offset="9071470">And two counties where the proof simply didn't sustain itself one in Hidalgo, we all conceded that their multimember district there could not be demonstrated to deprive the minority of that county of access.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.536" offset="9133537">The same was true in Galveston County where again a particularized local appraisal led everyone to the conclusion that the multimember district there did not in fact -- did not access.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="3334.289" offset="13440502">Very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.006" offset="13447398">Do you have anything further, Mrs. Levatino?</text>

          <turn speaker="elizabeth_b_levatino" startTime="3338.952" stopTime="3617.162">
            <label>Ms. Elizabeth B. Levatino</label>
            <text syncTime="3338.952" offset="13459205">Yes, Your Honor, I would like to state few very short and brief comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.956" offset="13483238">First of all, to answer the question which you posed to Mr. Gladden, Mr. Chief Justice, in other words what would be the comment on a minority -- minority inhabitant district which consistently elects a non-minority person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.182" offset="13548126">I think that the inference from that must be that they like the people that they represent and those none minority members do represent their interest well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.559" offset="13585638">I think with regard to Tarrant County, it must be remembered that blacks are part of these coalitions, that blacks have backed Anglo people who have also won, and that the Labor-Liberal coalition needs the black votes and searches for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.872" offset="13642898">This is not the case of the DCRG as you saw in Dallas County two years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.668" offset="13666095">Mr. Richards mentioned that according to Barbara Jordan, the change in the Texas -- in the racial makeup of the Texas legislature was solely attributable to reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.475" offset="13721266">I would like this Court or I would like to point out to this Court that we now have permanent voting registration in our state, which was not the case when this first round of Regester was first heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.341" offset="13772779">The voting rolls have risen from 3.8 million to 5.2 millions since 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.394" offset="13800991">Additionally, the poll tax has now been gone since appropriately 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.560" offset="13821576">The filing fees have been abolished basically are brought down very low either $150 or 1% of the people voting in the prior race not to exceed 5,000 signatures, the access to voting has certainly improved dramatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.513" offset="13893465">We have roving deputy registrars for voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.087" offset="13907675">You can register to vote by mail, and your registration is automatically renewed if you vote once every three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.368" offset="13940799">I submit that these are some of the reasons that there also has been a dramatic change in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.489" offset="13961279">Additionally, the statement was made that in Jefferson County COPE the political arm of the AFL-CIO never endorsed a minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.389" offset="13992939">I would submit that the record reflects that Mr. Price was endorsed as an acceptable candidate in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.638" offset="14017912">He then received 48% of the vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.093" offset="14027734">Also, an endorsement by COPE is not tantamount to election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.368" offset="14040795">As the record reflects, both representatives, Powers (ph) and Doyle who were in that delegation at that time of the trial of this case were elected without that endorsement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.779" offset="14082487">With regard to McLennan and Travis County going from Ward, City Council politics to the at large election, I would like to point out that those at large elections have resulted in two blacks being elected to the McLennan City Council and one black being elected twice to the Austin, which is the major city in Travis Council -- in Travis County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.225" offset="14180289">Again, I do not want to get into plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.335" offset="14192724">In the various presentation of the plans, only to say that while the state never acquiesced by not presenting plans we maintain throughout the trial that the court, if it found any districts unconstitutional, should allow the legislature to reapportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.097" offset="14259806">It had never been given that opportunity under court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.694" offset="14274121">Additionally, with regard to the plan presented in Jefferson County as was stated here earlier, Jefferson County is composed of Beaumont and Port Arthur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.772" offset="14318425">The plan which was submitted as agreed to by the members of the delegation from Jefferson County would have made Beaumont one district, the mid county area one district, and Port Arthur one district.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.389" offset="14364923">However, admittedly, splitting up the black votes, however plaintiff's plan started at one end of Beaumont, picking up as many blacks as they could, coming all the way through the mid county areas and down into Port Arthur, thereby, admittedly maximizing the minority strength in that district.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.026" offset="14443499">I submit that the legislative intent is reflected in the plans we did submit, was that of the members of the delegations, and we sought to do no more while maintaining our position that the legislature should have been given the right to redistrict if necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.542" offset="14509537">Again, I submit that the record in this case is insufficient for a Federal Court to wipe out the entire state policy of multimember districts based on the evidence, and based on the factors utilized by the Federal Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.629" offset="14565857">Thank you.</text>
