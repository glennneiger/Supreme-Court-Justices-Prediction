            <text syncTime="19.897" offset="183965">This case is here before you today on an appeal from the Supreme Court of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.699" offset="203191">It's an invasion of privacy case but does not involve libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.488" offset="218342">It does not involve any false statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.259" offset="225447">It does not involve any deformation.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.586" offset="234747">It's clearly a truthful, non-defamatory statement of a reporting of public trial in the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.021" offset="264526">It is a decision from the Supreme Court of Georgia to which we complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.620" offset="278841">It was a 4-3 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.634" offset="286887">The majority decision of the Supreme Court of Georgia held First Amendment rights provided constitutional guarantee of freedom of the press could not operate in favor of the defendant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.925" offset="336102">I think the factual circumstances of importing of the trial might be very significant.</text>

            <text syncTime="67.590" offset="374763">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.518" offset="378420">I am, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.049" offset="384585">On February of the 19th, you reserved the right on jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits of today.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.397" offset="418022">We are here as you know on an appeal and not a certiorari, we've asked alternatively for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.879" offset="447906">We are here under 1257.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.035" offset="456579">I think the -- without belaboring that issue, I do want to treat it briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.707" offset="475178">We have covered it in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.980" offset="480298">We feel that the recent Tornillo case, the Snyder case that is the North Dakota Pharmacy case amidst the finality issue suffice it to say that the Supreme Court of Georgia when they upheld the constitutionality of the statute which provided that we could not publish name or identity of a rape victim or one who was assaulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.032" offset="580504">They effectively destroyed our First Amendment Rights in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.160" offset="601088">There is a remand but that remand by the Supreme Court of Georgia deals with the right of the plaintiff and not the constitutional right of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.388" offset="649989">The remand went to the trial court was to this effect that the holding was, the Court is well aware, that the publication on identity of a name of a murder-rape victim and that is important in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.633" offset="710907">It was not solely a rape victim -- the murder-rape victim was not a matter of public interest or general concern in the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.591" offset="750717">Now, that precluded effectively, we say and made this case right for review in this Court as in Snyder and as in Tornillo that it made -- it precluded the defendant, our client from asserting any rights in the lower court regarding in the constitutional First Amendment considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.608" offset="838802">We think that like Tornillo, that it would be a delay, it would be a costly trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.054" offset="868582">These considerations we think there's an urgency because of the freedom of press.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.367" offset="889898">We think that here is a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.079" offset="900660">It's a restraint, a restraint on the freedom of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.938" offset="916125">The presumption that this Court has dealt with is when a restraint imposes itself by state statute otherwise on First Amendment rights, it comes here with the presumption of invalidity.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.850" offset="967847">Here, we had a reporting of a public trial, we have freedom of the press, the editors and not only the editors of news media in Georgia but everywhere where we have multi-state reporting have no conception as to what the rule would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.584" offset="1042766">Now, you remember there are only four states that have similar statutes, Florida, South California, Georgia, and Wisconsin, yet anybody that publishes a story that may go into another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.443" offset="1102117">Example, Saturday there was such a report in New Washington paper Saturday morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.719" offset="1123224">Yet, in fact story should go into Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.918" offset="1140046">The press has an exposure under Georgia law.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.295" offset="1157601">Likewise, if that story emanated in Georgia then came up on the national news service.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.023" offset="1184455">Georgia would have an action for the publication possibly both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.524" offset="1206502">So we are dealing and I say the urgency is, we are dealing with the freedom of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.083" offset="1228758">No one knows what the rule particularly is.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.890" offset="1235968">I like to try to deal with that a little bit today.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.844" offset="1251746">We say the urgency is that the freedom of the press if you say to extend this back to the trial court, it may take two or three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.720" offset="1283302">If this is an unconstitutional statute as we submit and with the presumption of invalidity as it comes to this Court --</text>

            <text syncTime="781.448" offset="3230156">This was the trial of six boys who went on trial for the murder-rape of Cynthia Cohn.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.759" offset="3267459">Remember that eight months before this trial, the girl's name had never been released.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.953" offset="3296193">At the trial and the circumstances of this trial are rather unusual and the result of this circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.068" offset="3324719">At this trial, these six boys decide to plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.070" offset="3344677">One of them, after sentencing, one of them withdrew his plea of guilty but it was by reason of the father -- the father of Cynthia Cohn whose name has not been disclosed in this report who asked the prosecutor to give leniency and to recommend a five-year term for these boys.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.890" offset="3427955">Now, remember he was not there, he was -- I don't know if even he is a material witness or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.482" offset="3450316">The prosecutor in this case asked the judge to accept the parent's recommendations and withdraw the murder charges and to give the boys fiver years.</text>

            <text syncTime="850.362" offset="3505800">One of them withdrew his plea and he was to be tried before a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.698" offset="3523145">At that time, this is very significant as you have said in the Butts case where Justice Harlan said that if the person was in the courtroom and actually was present there and saw this as in the Harney case, the reporter Wassell was in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.635" offset="3602975">The name of the Cynthia Cohn was on the indictment, it was a public record.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.086" offset="3632755">It was handed to the reporter in the courtroom by the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.658" offset="3647070">He has to look at the indictment and at that time it was murder-rape on Cynthia Cohn.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.280" offset="3677477">He went right outside the courtroom right after these have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.803" offset="3695658">After the case, Wassell televised a report on the courthouse steps very timely not like Briscoe that the Supreme Court of Georgia uses 11 years later which we submit the question of remoteness is not very material in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.190" offset="3753127">But he went right out there and he told what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.487" offset="3766293">It was factual, it was true, nobody disputes that, that's not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.323" offset="3785728">At that time he released the name of the girl Cynthia Cohn.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.769" offset="3803491">He merely says that this time that the boys were brought before the court, they were tried and it was great interest to the people of Sandy Springs and then publishes the name.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.173" offset="3849049">Now, this we submit on First Amendment Rights that this was a public reporting of a public trial and where is the girl's name was a newsworthy item.</text>

            <text syncTime="1313.246" offset="5357359">And I recognized at this Court his, -- in the sense has said that the invasion of privacy enjoys the constitutional protection, but as Justice Black said in his concurring opinion in Time versus Hill, he refers to it as judicially-created right and he says that if the courts continue to try their balance and weigh and take each, you're going to dilute more and more the right in the press.</text>

            <text syncTime="1461.885" offset="5951906">And I think that the question of public interest is the editor's decision because what you determine in the Tornillo is you said there's no imagination how can we find that government interference with what the editor puts in their paper and his exercise of editorial judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1498.238" offset="6097356">You left it in Tornillo that was his judgment but I can see very well that there could be extreme abuses and we might suggest to the Court that what Justice Harlan said in the Butts case and I just very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.505" offset="6154407">On a showing of how unreasonable conduct constitute in an extreme departure from standards of investigation reporting ordinarily adhere to by reasonable publishes that only in those instances and I think this Court should make the initial determination when an abuse question comes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.467" offset="6242283">You have done it in Miller versus California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.947" offset="6260151">You said there's no difficulty for us to determine what's commerce in ideas as against commercial exploitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.786" offset="6291498">The question of whether you submitted to the jury and the Roy case, I think that was in Monitor Patriot case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.316" offset="6325666">You said the question of relevance should not be submitted to the jury on standards of New York Times and this Court has recognized the uncertainty that juries can play.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.186" offset="6377179">Throughout your cases and the Gertz case, Justice Powell you indicated concern about what juries would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.475" offset="6410303">So, we submit that if you take Tornillo and you used the rule which was referred to in Gertz of the where it is extreme, where if it danger of substantial reputation to the reputation as apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.274" offset="6485535">And when you leave the editorial judgment and you have these two considerations either publication of the truth, non-defamatory like this carries with it if we may say so absolute privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.804" offset="6559619">And the Chappy says in invasion of privacy cases has mentioned in -- I think in the Gertz case or the Hill case that invasion of privacy cases possibly the individual where in this case were there's truth that he will have to stand his reputation before the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.843" offset="6639762">Now, I say that there maybe a cutting out of (Inaudible), of intrusion but those are not, those are intentional thoughts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.669" offset="6671109">Those are appropriation entry, intrusions and false light cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.827" offset="6695664">Here, there may be that rule or there maybe the rule and we suggest it to the Court that Tornillo with the rule if you want to have a provision for review of Justice Harlan's rule and you shall rule in the Butts case, it's only in those extreme cases where they do not, where they depart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.278" offset="6773509">The ruling was severe departure, he said and when they meant to find about AP and then let AP out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.702" offset="6803184">Their presence, they were in the courtroom that day they examined everything like here and they made their decision unlike Curtis Publishing where it was a feature story and they had two or three months lead time and they said, there was no finding of a severe departure from accepted publishing practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.777" offset="6883537">So we would submit that it is the editors in this case and in that way, you would serve to give the press a clear, understandable, and predictable rule that they could live with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.542" offset="6938603">Right now, the press in America in privacy cases, they won't know whether or not you're going to be considered newsworthy today or whether you're going to consider it newsworthy published 11 years ago or 10 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.459" offset="6998267">The expense of coming to a court every time is unmanageable by the news media.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.309" offset="7025643">And therefore, if you can fashion a rule in truthful cases, either one that in the case like this it has absolute privilege but in this case I'm talking now about the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.011" offset="7080396">We say we have already got that we have shown that, but in this case to apply the all such privacy cases that the editor's judgment should be paramount into consideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1764.907" offset="7163988">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.272" offset="7185512">I would like at the outset to restate in different words, but I think the issue in this case is and that is, is the public identification of the identity of the victim of a right a matter of public concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.540" offset="7250505">And thereby constitutionally protected or is it not and if it's not, can the state legislatively or judicially insure the privacy of a raped female and her family through either penal or civil sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.059" offset="7316647">I would also like to say at the outset that there is a distinction in this case that I believe the Supreme Court of Georgia drew.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.985" offset="7352383">I do not believe that the Supreme Court of Georgia made an initial threshold decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.188" offset="7377147">It did make that threshold decision that the specific identity of the victim of a rape was not a matter of general public concern or newsworthy in the constitutional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.354" offset="7429810">And only after it made that initial decision, did it hold that the statute involved here was constitutional and not in violation of the First Amendment, but it's the initial decision that was essential before we reach the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.259" offset="7489473">I would also like to state that there is no injunctive relief involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.921" offset="7516118">I think that the issue raised by one of the Court member's questions is an important one as to the difference between prior restraint and no prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.591" offset="7566796">And that will be found in a constitutional provision of the State of Georgia which holds that there is absolute freedom of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.568" offset="7602636">I don't have the precise language but there is absolute freedom of the press that shall not be infringed but those who exercise that freedom our responsible for the consequences in certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.424" offset="7658120">And I think some reference to the facts is also necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.341" offset="7673793">It was on August 18 of 1971 that the appellee's 17-year-old daughter was raped and she died shortly after that rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.467" offset="7714231">Six young men sometime later, some six months later were indicted for murder and rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.550" offset="7742548">The murder case was dismissed by nol pros or nolle prosequi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.863" offset="7759893">The rape and the death was widely publicized but no mention of the specific identity of the victim was made until the day of the disposition of five of the six cases in Fulton Superior Court in Atlanta.</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.778" offset="11699472">In the Evjue case, the Wisconsin case that was referred to by counsel for appellants is right on the point where the Supreme Court of Wisconsin said, there might be a minimal intrusion on freedom of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.080" offset="11748686">But that slight intrusion was hardly justification for its pinning the name and identity if the victim of a rape before the public with an extreme negative social implications that doing so.</text>
