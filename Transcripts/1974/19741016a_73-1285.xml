            <text syncTime="45.080" offset="283669">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.434" offset="297148">This case is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and involves a disciplinary sanction imposed against three 10th Grade female public school students for violating a school board regulation prohibiting the possession or use of intoxicating beverages at school or at a school sponsored function.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.856" offset="394846">The petitioners are members of the Board of Education of the Mena Special School District of Polk County, Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.319" offset="436642">Petitioners submit that the basic issue is whether the Court of Appeals properly reversed directed verdicts for the school board defendants in a public school student suit under 42 U.S.C., Section 1983 on the grounds that the school board had misconstrued and misapplied its own regulation and that the application of that regulation to these students deprived them of Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.081" offset="587734">Petitioners' contention that there's nothing in this record to warrant the exercise of federal jurisdiction in that respondents have shown the deprivation of no federally protected right.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.026" offset="663489">For reasons which I hope to discuss later, we submit that the issue of procedural due process is not properly before the Court in this case and would call the Court's attention to the fact that the amicus brief submitted on behalf of the respondents deals only with the procedural due process issue and does not reach the substantive due process question.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.925" offset="771114">The basic facts are uncontroverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.609" offset="793788">Early on the school day on February 7, 1972, three female students, two of them are respondents here, devised a plan to leave the school premises to purchase an alcoholic beverage which they intended to put into the refreshments to be served later that day at a joint parent-student function to be held on school premises, this function was sponsored by the Home Economics Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.818" offset="910608">Since the school district is situated in a county in Arkansas which has exercised its local option and has loaded “dry,” sale of alcoholic beverages in the county is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.538" offset="973511">The respondents drove out of the county, across the state line into the state of Oklahoma where they purchased at a tavern a quantity of malt liquor beverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.391" offset="1020949">Returning to Mena, they then purchased non-alcoholic beverage with which they mixed the malt liquor, returned to school and completed their plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.952" offset="1071208">Several days later, their teacher learned of this incident and confronted the girls with her information.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.650" offset="1106004">After first denying that they had been engaged in this conduct, they later admitted their involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.341" offset="1132753">The matter was then brought to the attention of the principal and he advised them that he would invoke a one-week suspension until such time as the Board of Education had opportunity to deal with the question and that it was their ultimate responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.727" offset="1202239">That evening, the board did meet to consider the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.280" offset="1216449">The principal and the teacher who had visited with the girls earlier that week relayed to the board the information that was given to him by the students and the board voted to suspend the girls for the balance of the semester pursuant to the regulation cited in our briefs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2808.040" offset="11335555">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.493" offset="11337331">If I might briefly, address the issue of procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.774" offset="11350497">As has been noted, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the March 2, 1972 hearing may have cured any prior procedural defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.972" offset="11395218">Indeed, the students and their counsel were granted every benefit that they claim in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.235" offset="11424266">They had notices of the meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.893" offset="11430954">They had a statement of facts upon which the action was taken at the inception of the meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.687" offset="11450075">They had the opportunity to appear to present any witnesses they cared to present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.467" offset="11465226">They were represented by a counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.734" offset="11474317">And if that doesn't constitute procedural due process in the public school context, then I don't know what does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.812" offset="11510575">The procedural due process issue will not sustain what the Court of Appeals has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.894" offset="11534921">I would assume that if the defect is found in the procedures, the remedy is to remand the case and give them a new hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.063" offset="11559581">Now, what on earth are they going to do when they give them a new hearing?</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.038" offset="11571493">What kind of evidence would be presented at that point that already has been presented?</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.939" offset="11591137">The point is that the school board construed its regulation to reach alcoholic beverages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.714" offset="11614229">Mrs. Gilford, a school board member, testified at the trial that when the rule was enacted, there was no discussion of a legal definition of intoxicating liquor, that the words intoxicating and alcoholic were synonymous.</text>
