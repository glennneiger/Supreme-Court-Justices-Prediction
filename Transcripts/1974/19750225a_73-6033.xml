            <text syncTime="72.585" offset="393697">That statute is not an issue here, the issue here is the requirement that the mother disclosed the name of the father in the first instance and subsequently initiate and prosecute paternity action.</text>

            <text syncTime="137.750" offset="654399">There was one case in which there was a possible incestuous parentage and also in which the actual paternity couldn't be determined with certainty.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.187" offset="1092106">The statute on its face imposes an obligation on all mothers of illegitimate children, however there is enforcement of the statute and a specific mechanism for enforcement setup for only three subclasses which include mothers who are an AFDC, mothers receiving town assistance and mothers who for one reason or another are not the guardians of their children or for whom guardians ad litem have been appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.578" offset="1217703">The Congress in Public Law 93-647 which was passed on the last day of the past session of Congress did enact extensive amendments to the Social Security Act including a major part concerning child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.978" offset="1283323">The basic thrust of that part was to strengthen the enforcement of child support obligations around the country as part of the child support program which will be mandatory on the states as part of their AFDC programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.004" offset="1367437">Congress required that states give an incentive payment to cooperating parents of 40% of the first $50.00 recovered from an absent parent in support.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.491" offset="1429295">It also provided a sanction, termination of the mothers welfare benefits made very clear that it was not sanctioning termination of the child's welfare benefits by providing that those continue in the form of protective payments which had to go to the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.847" offset="1514768">In the course of its deliberations, Congress rejected a Bill as 1842 which would have made it a federal misdemeanor to refuse to cooperate with the welfare departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.131" offset="1579865">That is the equivalent to what Connecticut does here.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.023" offset="1599509">As I say this was rejected by the Senate Finance Committee and I think that the legislative history clearly shows that Congress in passing the provisions which it did pass set the limits of the powers of the state to infringe on the fundamental purposes of AFDC in pursuing its own financial interest as those purpose being to safeguard the best interest of children by providing support for them in their own homes and to maintain and strengthen family life.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.334" offset="1768678">I think in passing the provisions which it passed Congress clearly indicated that no other and certainly no more severe sanctions could be employed in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.420" offset="1825102">Furthermore, the Connecticut statute does, it seems to us clearly undermine the general requirement of regulations of the Department of Health Education and Welfare that methods of administration used in the AFDC program not undermine the privacy and dignity of recipients.</text>

            <text syncTime="1854.953" offset="7523140">Thank you sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.175" offset="7528051">May I address the merits for a moment from the perspective of the children of appellants which is that Mr. Justice Rehnquist, your statement before that the statute applies to all children is correct with a reservation that the procedural mechanism of the statute provides that for children who are not on welfare, the proceedings against the mother can be instituted if and only if there is a determination that instituting those proceedings will serve the best interest of the children whereas with children on welfare, that determination is not made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.459" offset="7665246">Now, the distinction arises in the following way, a proceeded -- excuse me, a proceeding may be brought and -- the case of a child not on welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.967" offset="7703280">Only by a guardian or a guardian ad litem of the child, now, what this means first is that a court must determine that the best interest of the child will be served by appointment of a guardian or guardian ad litem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.593" offset="7753749">Second, the guardian or guardian ad litem prosecuting the action to compel the mother to give the name is required by fiduciary obligations to act only in the interest of the child by contrast, the welfare department and the welfare commissioner, the defendant in this case is empowered to bring actions against children who are on welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.876" offset="7846849">It is his policy stipulated in the record and brought out in the evidence to bring those actions against each and every woman on welfare who fails to make disclosure whether or not the best interest of that woman's child will be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.715" offset="7910275">So the poor child, the child on welfare that is to say, gets no protection of the child's interests and the child who is not on welfare is ensured by the procedural mechanism by which the proceedings are brought that the proceedings will be brought if and only if those interest are served and will be pursued only insofar as those interest are served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.801" offset="8002539">Mr. Cochran's alluded to the harm that may come to the children whom I represent as a result of brining paternity -- rather bringing disclosure proceedings where the interest of the child might not be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.507" offset="8053426">Those harms are very serious and they've said out in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.721" offset="8078294">In the short time remaining I won't give you too many examples of them but for example, a mother may be establishing a relationship with a perspective stepfather or adoptive father which might be interrupted by bringing the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.115" offset="8139839">A woman who gave an affidavit below is the name plaintiff in a companion case risks this fellowship from her church should the fact that she was the mother of an illegitimate child become known.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.430" offset="8201070">In those cases, a guardian or a guardian ad litem of the child might have decided that brining the action would not serve the child's interest and would not have brought the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.403" offset="8240985">The Commissioner of Welfare will bring the action because the Commissioner of Welfare has determined to bring the action in each and every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.417" offset="8273063">Now the justifications offered by the state to -- for the distinction of -- or first there's the obvious distinction between children and welfare and children not on welfare that the state argues a more substantial recoup in interest in the event -- in the case of children on welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.119" offset="8355819">As to that, let me say first that that distinction has no rational relationship to the precise discrimination worked by the statute because the precise discrimination worked by the statute deprives the child on welfare of any representation as a matter of right in the proceedings which will determine whether or not the mother has to make disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.342" offset="8456756">The child who is not on welfare has that protection and has a guardian ad litem under the statutory procedure and the proceeding can be brought without it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.031" offset="8499493">So that the child whose on welfare doesn't have a spokesman, doesn't have a representative of his interest while a child is not on welfare, it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.101" offset="8543796">Whatever the balance the court may strike between the interests of the state in recoupment, the interest of the mother in privacy, the interest of the child and protection of the child's interest is not related at all to the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.728" offset="8602311">So whether the child's interest are entitled to have a voice at that proceeding when the child is poor if they are given a voice when the child is not on welfare and that's the discrimination work by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.508" offset="8649435">Now, the -- in addition, we talk in our brief and I won't belabor the point here about the importance of the child's rights and our position there is simply that the states financial interest cannot in any event justify abandoning those child's rights and interest in the case of children who are in welfare when those interest are pursued and protected when the child was not on welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.908" offset="8770957">The states primary justification for the statutory scheme is that disclosure serves the interest of all children, on welfare and not on welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.290" offset="8808573">The compulsion is good for the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.802" offset="8818604">To this, the reply is so it may be in some cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.817" offset="8834591">But it is frequently not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.623" offset="8841906">The evidence in the record below was powerful that it is not in many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.734" offset="8858311">The unrebutted expert testimony we produced from very distinguished experts was that it was quite frequently not the case that compelling the mother in instances in which he didn't want to make disclosure, to make disclosure might hurt the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.780" offset="8914526">In any event, our -- when seen from the perspective of the -- what we consider be a rationale of the other state interest, the recoupment interest, this claim that the best interest of the child or what is advanced amounts to an irrebuttable presumption contrary to fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.296" offset="8980564">It's an irrebuttable presumption that the interest of the child will be served although the child is denied in the hearing, a guardian or a guardian ad litem if the child is on welfare to attempt to show that those interest will not be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.509" offset="9041377">It's an irrebuttable presumption that the child's interest will be served which is belied by the record below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.933" offset="9075127">It is in short an irrebuttable presumption which the state applies selectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.123" offset="9095816">It applies it selectively to children who are on welfare but it does not apply the irrebuttable presumption that disclosure and compulsion always serves the child's interest and the case of children who are not on welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.399" offset="9161017">In short, this is a statute which in the name of the best interest of the child which has been the state's claim all the way through as to the point of statute in fact deprives a subclass of those children, those illegitimate children of an opportunity to have their best interest voiced and have their best interest be determined.</text>

            <text syncTime="2343.151" offset="9475950">Yes, but the thing that you might have to study is how much money you'll get back by pursuing the small class of women who resist disclosure of the name of the putative father even when told by the Welfare Department of the possible benefits which might come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.933" offset="9543137">That's -- that's the money that's being lost and the record indicates that the money that is going to be recouped by the State of Connecticut is rather small, in fact it's extremely small because of the fact that the fathers may be absent, fathers may not be available, fathers may be impecunious and all those factors by the way are factors which the mother or the guardian of the child can attempt to elicit in determining whether the interest of the child will be served by going after the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.915" offset="9667062">If there is a father who has money, who has resources, the interest of the child may be served by pursuing that father.</text>

            <text syncTime="2800.910" offset="11307029">Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.805" offset="11326568">The root of the problem in this matter of course is the identity of the putative father.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.909" offset="11354990">In Shirley versus Lavine, that's in 365 Federal Supp. 818, this case is very much unlike that case in this sense, in Charlie versus Levine, the mother or mothers involved in that particular case were asked to go beyond to identify the father -- putative father and take further actions against the putative father nor its institutive paternity action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.343" offset="11456763">We don't have that problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.491" offset="11465331">All the Connecticut statute is interest is learning -- excuse me, the identity of the putative father and that's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.907" offset="11498977">The state is equipped to take its own independent action against the putative father to establish paternity and call the mother in as a witness as provided by our laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.666" offset="11542026">Also not involved in this matter is the reduction of AFDC benefits, that's clearly not involved in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.790" offset="11574523">Of course, the first step is utilizing Section 52-440b in order to learn the identity of the putative father if the mother voluntary refuses to disclose the name.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.588" offset="11625723">We maintain that in Connecticut, our paternity laws including Section 52-440b are civil including the contempt provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.983" offset="11671280">Now, the paternity laws in our state do provide Fifth Amendment immunity and therefore the mother's rights in this matter not jeopardized in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.424" offset="11729063">The primary purpose of the comprehensive -- Connecticut's comprehensive scheme here is the protection of children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.153" offset="11767933">Money, yes, collection of money form putative fathers is an important interest that's a substantial interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.601" offset="11789772">Nevertheless, that is not the primary purpose of our laws in relation to paternity, that includes 52-440b.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.619" offset="11825821">Now, of course we recite in our briefs -- in our brief rather that there has been a trend to create a balance between illegitimate children and legitimate children so the rights equal allowed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.065" offset="11891649">In other words, we have some cases declaring that the social security benefits should be awarded to children on the Social Security -- illegitimate children on the Social Security Act involves their BA benefits and they're entitled to today and of course their rights protected on the wrongful debt statutes of illegitimate children and the list goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.246" offset="11984332">But there's also something else to of significance here that there has been a trend, at least I think it's a trend greater rights for the putative father and this of course it's just beginning in my opinion that there had been state court cases in this area where the putative father for instance is giving or given the right of custody over his first child especially if their -- the mother has committed neglect or has become deceased and of course that the father can provide the home and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.789" offset="12126542">Also there is a case where -- was decided that the putative father, his consent must be obtained as far as adoption is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.606" offset="12169801">So it's not a question of only support, there are other rights -- the primary rights involved here of course are the children but there is the putative father's rights as well as the mothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.141" offset="12211911">We also point out in our brief for some practical problems here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.208" offset="12224240">For instance, applications shouldn't the -- certainly the illegitimate child have the same right as a illegitimate child to fill in blank space on an application where it says father and this is the whole probably one of the most practical problems we can point out to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.404" offset="12301040">You also have in Connecticut inheritance laws and we have Section 45-274 which in effect says that a illegitimate child may inherit from its natural mother with all the rights and benefits as a legitimate child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.166" offset="12376064">Again, this points up be comprehensive -- a part of the comprehensive plan in Connecticut to protect the rights and further the rights of illegitimate child along with legitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.246" offset="12440325">Now, we say the specific purpose of Section 52-440b of course is to, yes, learn the identity of the putative father for the object of eventually obtaining support in behalf of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.423" offset="12505109">Again, we emphasize that's an important purpose but not the primary purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.645" offset="12521932">The primary purpose of course, the comprehensive scheme to protect the children, this is just one face of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.044" offset="12555577">Now, the statute that we're talking about includes all mothers with illegitimate children contrary to our opponent's view here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.190" offset="12596120">Now, we do have some statistics cited in the -- in our brief and I don't believe that I waste time covering that but I think we must understand that the -- what it boils down -- boil down to is this, that I think just as well as anyone else rights are subject control, constitutional rights of any rights, the mother must have -- there must be some control of the mother's rights in this type of a problem as it bears on the -- her child or children's rights and this is where Section 52-440b comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.437" offset="12789112">Now, we have claim by the appellants here that the statute, Connecticut statute is in conflict with the Social Security Act was pointed out in the lower court that quite to the contrary, the Social Security Act specifically 42 U.S. Code 602(a)(17)(a) one and two give a frank recognition of the importance of establishing the paternity of an illegitimate child for not only for financial reasons but for the primary purposes of Social Security Act to ensure that the child was brought up in an environment in a family type life, type family type setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.309" offset="12968626">Now, our statute is merely drawn to carry out the purposes of the Social Security Act as I just related.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.460" offset="13005197">On February 18, we receive the copy of a typewritten supplemental brief discussing Public Law 93-647 Part B.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.399" offset="13045008">Again contrary to our opponents in this matter, I don't believe that the amendments by Congress in relation to the Social Security Act favor our opponents in many way whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.934" offset="13091088">Quite to the contrary, I think they enhance of states position here in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.528" offset="13117524">First of all, looking at the amendments, the amendment still incorporate the provision of the Social Security Law, that was Section 602 (a) 17, that is the state plan must have provision in their to establish the paternity of an illegitimate child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.058" offset="13199653">Then what -- amendments actually did in my opinion is to add provisions to the Social Security Act adding these two provisions that the mother nor as a condition of eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.239" offset="13268302">The mother must cooperate with the welfare authorities in establishing paternity and helping to secure support for the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.561" offset="13313651">Of course, cooperation must be construed the identity of the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.008" offset="13331414">I need to get over that basic threshold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.151" offset="13348028">Now, I read a clear intent of Congress saying that if the mother elects not to disclose the name of the putative father under the most recent amendments that she can be cut from welfare assistance, I think what Congress is saying that, alright if she wants to exercise that right, she's off assistance, she's out of the protection of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.310" offset="13444577">Her children remain under the protection of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.397" offset="13460982">Now as I understand trying to analyze my opponent's view on this thing if the mother is removed from the protection of the Social Security Act then certainly I don't think Congress intended that the state may not act under Section 52-440b in the plot against the mother here who is no longer on assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.197" offset="13544155">After all the states so has no obligation to protect the children that are lift on welfare assistance under the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.853" offset="13586787">In short, I don't think we have a statutory conflict because of that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.526" offset="13605491">I move -- may I move on to the right of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.399" offset="13620955">Our position that there is no fundamental rights involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.644" offset="13641958">Our opponents discuss that the -- if the mother is forced to disclose the name of the putative father that gets into an area that's embarrassing to her, it appears with the most intimate details of her life, we maintain no that first of all from the practical side, when the mother has an illegitimate child, these facts become known partially any way to the community around her and I don't care if she goes out of state to have her child when she comes back to the community, the community or neighbors no doubt will find out that she had an illegitimate child through one process or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.829" offset="13814680">So the harm if there is any harm here has been done, it doesn't certainly involve the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.134" offset="13835891">We say also that the inquiry does not go into so-called the intrusion into the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.621" offset="13861804">It does not interfere with interpersonal decisions on the part of the mother or any one else she knows nor does a judge -- nor are we sending ourselves up through the statute to judge the mother's misconduct if it is misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.248" offset="13932335">We're not forbidding the mother to have a man in the house or in the bedroom for that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.984" offset="13951352">Again, it's very limited in the sense all we want is the identity of the father, no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.891" offset="13974967">She doesn't have to testify beyond that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.624" offset="13997850">That's in -- as far as the contempt procedures are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.923" offset="14015091">Now, even if there -- we recognize that the mother does have some rights here --</text>

            <text syncTime="3982.931" offset="16035088">I think of the Section 52-440b in relation to due process, now we maintain it is rationally related to carry out the purposes of protecting the child here and gaining support and so forth but the standard, the procedure involved, certainly the object as I pointed out before of the Connecticut statute is to learn the identity to eventually obtain support.</text>
            <text syncTime="4011.313" offset="16148668">That certainly is within the Government's scope to compel testimony and my understanding, the only constitutional restriction of the scope of the Government's power to compel testimony is the Fifth Amendment and we did make provision in other parts of our law for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4028.411" offset="16217004">What the opponents -- our opponents bring up are these four things that the statute creates an irrebuttable presumption and that there's no individualized hearing I take that to me in the trial type hearing, also there are no -- they're not sufficient standards under due process of law and the statute is too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.793" offset="16310523">First of all, looking at Section 52-440b, the statute says when disclosures to be made under what circumstances and to whom and the subject matter is quite restricted if the mother fails or refuses to disclose the name of the putative father of such child under oath, that is the subject matter of the act involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.661" offset="16406026">Now, once the court, the Court of Common Pleas now, gets by that first set of standards, it then under the contempt proceedings in Connecticut, it must eventually answer this or apply these standards, who is making the demand here, under what circumstances whether there is a refusal to be sworn or to refuse to disclose whether the refusal is justified in law, whether there's a question that is proper and whether the proper question is recently reasonably related to the subject matter inquiry and of course the Court of Common Peas in a contempt proceeding has the power to hear witnesses and even undertake or hear defenses in behalf of the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.048" offset="16607587">Now also through the hearing, the contempt hearing itself, obviously due process law applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.917" offset="16663071">In other words the mother will be protected as far as any excess of means of -- in other words state to extract evidence from her.</text>
            <text syncTime="4143.145" offset="16675924">In other words, I'm getting at is this would take care the appellants fourth argument -- Fourth Amendment argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4150.277" offset="16704449">Also, under the statute legal process also applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.006" offset="16723362">In other words, a mother -- no one can just drag the mother off the street here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4158.354" offset="16736737">A citation must be issued and she is ordered to show cause why she should not be held in contempt as far as disclosing the name of the putative father.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.321" offset="16776652">She has a right of counsel just as like anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="4171.115" offset="16787832">There is no -- in other words, the Connecticut laws do not prevent her from having her own counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4176.671" offset="16810088">If she has -- doesn't have sufficient funds, again there is state law or state policy or inherit within the state courts discretion here to see that she does get counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.586" offset="16865677">Also, in the contempt proceedings, the judgment that's handed down is a final order and reviewable by the State Supreme Court and the subject of review goes into the jurisdiction as to the Court's right to punish.</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.823" offset="16934640">Also in to the area, could the acts involved constitute contempt?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Anthony Arcari</label>
            <text syncTime="4322.926" offset="17395127">Well, if I may answer that question, my understanding, there are two types of contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4329.570" offset="17421667">If an act of contempt is committed before the Court, the statutory standards apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="4335.783" offset="17446536">Here we're having the mother brought in which means the common law standards apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.382" offset="17464926">Now as far as appeal for -- from the Court of Common Pleas to the State Supreme Court, I believe the statute would control the appeal and I believe that was -- that is in other words the statute would dictate the procedure involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.855" offset="17546742">Now, an important matter in this of significance is that the Court of Common Pleas has a power under the statute to exercise some judicial discretion and this is put it out in the trial court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4376.471" offset="17609226">What do I mean by that?</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.781" offset="17614451">Three phases of it, first of all the court has the sound discretion to decide whether to order contempt or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4385.890" offset="17646947">Two, if it finds a mother in contempt, there still has a discretion whether to enforce penalty or not to order penalty and also above this business about bringing -- forcing the mother to bring a prosecuting paternity action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.112" offset="17707865">The Court of Common Pleas still has discretionary powers to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4404.874" offset="17722911">We point out in our brief that since we have other laws in the paternity sections of our laws, that allow the town or the state to bring a paternity action, obviously the court will exercise discretion and suggest to the state that they bring independent action whether in trying to force a mother who is perhaps trained to resist at that point to bring this action because obviously this will have in effect in the trier of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4434.085" offset="17839731">Also, I want to go to discussing all the standards, I point to the Court, I don't see how we can come to the conclusion that in any way possible there is cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution, individualized hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4452.230" offset="17912247">I don't believe my understanding from reading some cases any way that due process of law requires a trial type hearing in these proceedings as far as a contempt under Section 52-440b.</text>
            <text syncTime="4469.195" offset="17980165">You have to keep in mind the appellants are not on trial for their conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4473.732" offset="17998346">All are being brought in the court for as a limited inquiry with sufficient safeguards on the due process of law, what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="4482.307" offset="18032619">This is not a prosecution type situation where again their conduct comes into focus here in the court is going to go beyond learning the identity of the putative father.</text>
            <text syncTime="4496.807" offset="18090611">The appellants bring up the First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4500.202" offset="18104195">They claim that they have a right not to divulge this information under the First Amendment and of course a First Amendment type argument we have perhaps a high standard being applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4514.169" offset="18160097">I like to point it out to the Court that the First Amendment doesn't prohibit the state again its power to compel testimony here but it does obviously restrict the states here and it's my understanding that if the state's interest involved is cogent to justify abridging the right of association or what have you, then in this case the states -- our position should be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="4539.987" offset="18263333">Now again, I want to emphasize that we believe our position in this matter is compelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="4546.237" offset="18288306">I think it's overwhelming in the sense of protecting the rights of the illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="4553.626" offset="18317876">Certainly, I pointed out before that on regard to the appellant's argument that they have a right under the First Amendment not to resort to the courts, now what they mean by that is again going back to the Court of Common Pleas possibly forcing them, other they bring a paternity action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4573.941" offset="18399169">I gave a little bit of background about that but certainly the paternity aspect of it prosecution of attorney suit is not compulsory under 52-440b, also the contempt provisions are not mandatory and certainly our act does not force the mother or any mother to adopt beliefs or attitudes, anything different from what they actually believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.836" offset="18510764">It comes -- come down to the equal protection claim here and of course the lower court applied the rational standard here which I think is a correct standard to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="4616.607" offset="18569801">We pointed out in the beginning of this argument that the state position was that we have a comprehensive scheme and at the core, that comprehensive scheme is to protect and further the rights of illegitimate children are the means under Section 52-440b to protect those rights learning the identity of father.</text>
            <text syncTime="4635.689" offset="18646079">Certainly rationally related to carry out the provisions of that comprehensive scheme and also any provisions under the Social Security Act, but commenting just a moment that I think we also under that same argument have a compelling interest as I noted before.</text>
            <text syncTime="4661.207" offset="18748165">We're talking about the classifications themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="4664.460" offset="18761226">Our point to spring up that there's a sex classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="4668.740" offset="18778363">You have to keep in mind that man yet do not bear children, women carry on that function and the point here is that we have a very unique situation so I don't think in any serious sense of the word you can take women in this type of context and say we have a suspect classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="4687.003" offset="18851401">Also our opponents pointed out to this Court that they believe there's a suspect classification as to poverty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4696.638" offset="18889958">Again, we pointed out before that our statute does not apply simply to poverty or to women on -- receiving AFDC benefits or the family as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.880" offset="18930918">They apply to as I pointed out to Justice Powell that it applies to people not receiving AFDC benefits or any state welfare assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4717.273" offset="18972505">So I don't think you can say that poverty is a suspect classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="4721.476" offset="18989328">It was brought up by Judge Blumenfeld in the lower court that at that time the appellants claim that the children, illegitimate children became -- were -- or rather were a suspect classification and Judge Blumenfeld quickly stated that this is taking the classification and standing on its head in the sense that the Section 52-440b is designed to help the children not to detract from the rights or benefits and therefore it fits on the corners with the Social Security Act and also certainly rationally related and not in violation of the equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4771.283" offset="19188485">If I may point out something that I emphasize again that we do not have a criminal contempt involved as far as Section 52-440b that it's my understanding of the law that children in our state are not under represented by guardian ad litem at certain times but also its customer to appoint attorneys to represent children.</text>
            <text syncTime="4813.679" offset="19358072">The -- I suppose unless there is a conflict of interest, the guardian ad litem could be the attorney representing the child but they don't necessarily have to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4825.777" offset="19406451">The attorney representing the children involved in this matter made a statement which says that as far as they were concerned, the welfare department, the welfare policy is to bring an action and I -- on this Court those words bring in action against the mothers involved noted to get them disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4843.596" offset="19477713">The state welfare department does not bring an action against any mother receiving welfare assistance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4849.342" offset="19500701">They take the information, their policy provides that they take the information, they review it and if there has -- if there's a problem involved in the identity of father we refer it over to outside counsel then it -- in short they refer it to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.356" offset="19568828">And everything that goes on from that point on is under the supervision of the Court of Common Pleas under the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4873.345" offset="19596727">And of course the statute itself as I pointed out in our argument heavily controls the Court of Common Pleas here with sufficient standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4884.437" offset="19641135">And of course, our opponents mentioned or made quite a bit of the financial interest of the state as long as I can -- probably end my argument on this note.</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.780" offset="19694529">That certainly I admit to this tribunal that the financial interest of the state is very substantial here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4907.095" offset="19731728">But I still think that the primary interest involved are the welfare of the children, the illegitimate children and so long as I'm a member of the Connecticut bar, I plan to work towards that effort even though I may find myself collecting money from putative fathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.451" offset="19809155">That still hasn't deterred me from keeping that principle uppermost of my mind as far as the protection in welfare of the children.</text>
