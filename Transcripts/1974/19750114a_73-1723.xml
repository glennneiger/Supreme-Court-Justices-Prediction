            <text syncTime="59.757" offset="342392">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.188" offset="360155">This is a suit which is brought by the appellees as a class action to challenge the provisions of the constitution of Texas, the statutes of the state of Texas and ordinances of the City of Fort Worth which require essentially that to vote in an election to authorize the issuance of general obligation bonds, the voter must rendered either personal or real property or both for taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.397" offset="476975">This is of course is the legal obligation of all Texas citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.809" offset="498604">The three-judge District Courts sitting in the Northern District of Texas found that various sections of our constitution, of our statutes and of the ordinances or chart of the City of Fort Worth were unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.136" offset="555865">It said they are hereby declared unconstitutional in so far as they condition the right to vote in bond elections on citizens rendering property for taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.795" offset="602572">Injunctive relief was granted and the appellant's were ordered to give effect to certain votes in an election, the election which was in question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.824" offset="650637">I would like to state our argument very briefly if I may and then elaborate on it as time permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.046" offset="683551">I think the first point we would make is that the attack on our constitution is based on the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.100" offset="723780">A condition to the invoking of that clause is that there be some classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.663" offset="750007">It is our position and I think we can show that there is no classification involved here that all residence of the State of Texas are qualified to vote in these elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.537" offset="813537">The second point I would make is that if there is a classification, nevertheless, we're not talking here about whether or not the citizens of town -- county of Fort Worth may vote on the question for instance of whether or not they can build a library.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.982" offset="907264">The vote in question was on whether or not $6,860,000.00 should be financed to the cost of the library, should be financed by bonds payable from taxes, on rendered real and personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.982" offset="975287">It is the policy of the State of Texas that only those who obey the law, which does require that everyone render his property and who do render their property and pay taxes on it, although the payment of taxes is not a prerequisite, should be entitled to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.889" offset="1070895">The statutes declare that all property, real, personal, mixed, except that which is subject to -- I'm sorry -- except that which is exempt is subject to taxation and shall be rendered and listed between January 1st and April 30th of each year.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.563" offset="1261589">We do have in the record that in 1971 I believe there were some $4 billion in personal property rendered in the State of Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="3187.259" offset="12852433">Yes, yes, I think that before you can limit franchise or create a sub class of qualified voters that are going to pass on something such as library branch or such as financing capital assets of a junior college district, you've got to have some rational basis for restricting that vote to persons who have rendered property for taxation and Texas had just wholly failed -- Arizona wholly failed and its an interesting thing that our sister State of Oklahoma in 1969 twice ruled on that question and found that that kind of a requirement was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.097" offset="13015751">And then in 1971, following this Court's decision in Phoenix, reversed itself and granted an injunction against the application of such a city ordinance and said, "We're going to follow what the Supreme Court said in Phoenix" and write about the same time that the Supreme Court of Oklahoma was doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.139" offset="13103940">And the Supreme Court of Texas will say, we sit without talking about restricting voting, without talking about tailoring the restriction to fit that particular function or need that the state had but just summarily said, we don't think there's anything wrong with making people pay their fair share of the taxes and the tax assessor must exhaust every means of ferreting out and locating Mr. Kendall's personal property that he has failed to render but has had a portion of it rendered by the tax assessor and does qualify him to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.248" offset="13260361">I suggest that while there may be, it may not be the wealth qualification that was raised in the poll tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.367" offset="13296828">It still is an additional requirement that there is no rational basis for it.</text>
