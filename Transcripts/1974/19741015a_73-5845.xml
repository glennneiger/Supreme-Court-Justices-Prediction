            <text syncTime="39.984" offset="265341">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.000" offset="289374">The case involves whether a public utility which provides electricity under a grant of monopoly conferred by the state which possesses under state law various and considerable powers and is regulated by the state pervasively may pursuant to state granted and approved crimination procedures cut off a consumer's power without notice and hearing for alleged nonpayment of a disputed bill.</text>

            <text syncTime="81.348" offset="430853">Our answer to this question briefly is that a monopoly functioning under such state granted powers and regulations which supplies a necessity of life performed state action in the Fourteenth Amendment sense, and with respect to its crimination procedures must accord due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.144" offset="505981">And in a case like this, due process of law requires some sort of fair notice and hearing procedures before termination.</text>

            <text syncTime="120.917" offset="589051">Our suggestion on the hearing procedure, the hearing on crimination would be that we adopt the position of the brief amicus curiae of the New York State Public Utilities Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.954" offset="637221">And that is that the cause should be sent or should be reversed in fact of the District Court with an invitation -- the District Court extending an invitation or perhaps requiring the State Public Utilities Commission to come in and together fashioning a fair termination hearing procedure of the cases of this Court and elsewhere demonstrate that a large variety of procedures could possibly accord with the requirements of due process of law and we do not argue for any particular kind of procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="275.511" offset="1207421">So, perhaps that's why I view them synonymously because I think this implicates the standing issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.502" offset="2023382">And we do not contend that a supplier who does not enjoy a state conferred monopoly of a necessity of life or anyone else is by the Due Process Clause required to grant notice in hearing before cutting off, for example, milk deliveries or gasoline or credit or so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="969.164" offset="3982043">If it is sufficient, it is deemed to be a property right, although, this case also can be viewed as involving liberty because when one's power is cut off, one is left in the dark and the cold.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.985" offset="4025407">It certainly is a circumscription of one's liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.510" offset="4039408">The expectation in continuous service is one which subscribers to the utility have by virtue of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.294" offset="4066576">Section 1171 of the Public Utilities Code requires reasonably continuous service without delays and unreasonable interruptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.227" offset="4102311">Decisions of the Public Utility Commission which are not cited in the briefs but they're published such as Westinghouse Club against Pennsylvania Water Company which is October 8, 1935;</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.955" offset="4149227">Laffey against Manufacturers Light and Heat, August 27, 1934 and Pishnery versus Brownsville Water Company, June 12, 1928 and numerous other decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.765" offset="4192486">These are only three out of several score hold its service may not be terminated for nonpayment of a disputed bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.881" offset="4220907">But there is no meaningful way to enforce this right because there was no right to a hearing before cut off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.868" offset="4244940">Counsel in this very case, I might add, has petitioned the Public Utilities Commission on July 25th and 31st, 1973 on behalf of this petitioner and others, in a complaint alleging that they are subject to having their water service cut-off for nonpayment of bills without prior hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.899" offset="4321008">And the commission on March 20th, 1974 dismissed the complaint as failing to state a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.224" offset="4350265">It treated them as requesting a rule allowing installment payments to be made on bills but deferred action even on that until after this Court rules in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.422" offset="4399062">Therefore, we submit that petitioner's expectation is sufficient to rise to the level of property and liberty protected by the Due Process Clause, although state procedures are inadequate to protect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.549" offset="4451621">Second factor, what is the effect of summary termination on the one whose property or liberty is taken?</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.158" offset="4474086">The effect in this case, we submit, is as brutal, to use a term that appears in the cases about the determination of welfare as Goldberg against Kelly, garnishing of wages as in Sniadach which was said to drive a family to the wall or termination of a driver's license as in Bell against Burson which interfered with conduct of a ministry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.935" offset="4561126">And despite the argument of the Court of Appeals that oil burners can be operated manually and ice can be used in refrigerators and kerosene lamps provide adequate illumination, that is just not so when you say it's common knowledge that it's not so in an urban society and I think we all recall the near catastrophe when the power grid failed in the northeast and that affect upon a single individual is proportionately the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="1149.711" offset="4704277">They are perhaps in one point or another in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.116" offset="4725906">One of the alternatives for the petitioner, petitioner cannot get electricity elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.676" offset="4752133">Unlike the employee in Arnett who might get another job or the untenured professor in Roth, who might get employment elsewhere and respondent's monopoly assures that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.708" offset="4796228">Another point which the decisions consider is what may be the effect on the community of taking time for notice and hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.469" offset="4823291">This is unlike the case of poisoned food which must be seized before distribution or narcotics which must be seized before they work the way and have their effect or the situation of a bank which is about to fail and then we'll bring financial failure to large parts of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.074" offset="4889746">It's not a case like that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.242" offset="4898419">It might be argued that taking time for notice and hearing entails costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.052" offset="4917645">Hearings may indeed cost something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.387" offset="4926945">Petitioner in theory may run off the pressure of unpaid bills but fair hearing rule should, could and as in New York and as has been suggested by, I believe it was Mr. Justice Blackmun, a requirement that the temporary restraining order might have been continuation of payment of bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.575" offset="4999670">Petitioner might even be required to pay weekly a variety of measures can be taken to assure the security of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.331" offset="5030703">The passed bill is owed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.696" offset="5036241">The question is what's going to be happening in the future?</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.493" offset="5055363">Certainly, this is not a case in which leaving time for hearing permits a petitioner to abscond with property as in some of the cases this Court has treated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2053.532" offset="8319519">For instance, Fortune reported in September that in March of 1974, when four went its dividend of 28 million, consolidated Edison had outstanding bills of $367,151,000.00 with an average life of 59 days, those bills.</text>

            <text syncTime="2119.025" offset="8581475">I think it's maybe posed most directly by the California amici when they present the issue that state action is present where a significant governmental interest are promoted by a pattern of regulation delegating state power to a extensively private persons who then act with the force of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.124" offset="8693906">That is similar to what counsel said and repeated about this graft of monopoly power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.286" offset="8742599">It didn't work that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.182" offset="8758168">In 1913, when the Public Utility Law of Pennsylvania was passed and the set forth regulation over not only electric utilities but of course, worth companies, grain elevator companies, telephone companies, pipeline corporations, ferries and all the other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.073" offset="8893691">Met Ed -- and the service of electricity by Met Ed's predecessors had been going on for a substantial time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.650" offset="8928068">Met Ed is still subject to a 99-year lease under then to 1894 and has a contract in perpetuity with the town of Middleton to sell them electricity at a standard kilowatt hour in perpetuity that was entered into in 1906.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.569" offset="8999748">So, it was not a grant of state power that resulted in the regulated utility system we have today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.205" offset="9042275">Instead, it was a recognition that many businesses are affected with the public interest and the desire to protect consumer -- consumer led to their regulation that being true in Justice Brandeis' concurring opinion on South Western Bell and goes into this subjected to the link.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.353" offset="9146870">That being true, all acts of a public utility are not actions of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.672" offset="9184068">Now, where the State has particularly ordered the electric utility to do something and the utility then goes out under color of not order and does something, certainly, that would be a type of action that would receive the protection with that the petitioner here seeks.</text>
