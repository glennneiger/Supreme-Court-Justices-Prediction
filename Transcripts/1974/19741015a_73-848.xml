            <label>Mr. Donald E. Wasik</label>
            <text syncTime="32.698" offset="234141">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.876" offset="246888">This class action suit concerns the adequacy of Connecticut's administrative procedures which I used to determine weekly claims for unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.313" offset="288580">A three-judge District Court had before it two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.057" offset="303626">One, do the Connecticut procedures violate the so-called when due provisions of the Social Security Act and two, do they violate the due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.616" offset="361827">The lower court found that there was no statutory violation but did rule that there was a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.765" offset="394428">Since the District Court found no statutory violation and because no appeal was taken from that decision by the claimants, this issue is not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.287" offset="436537">Therefore the only statement on the merits of this issue which has been raised in my opponent's brief is that the lower court and the Court in the Torres, the decisions were correct in ruling that where a decision is made, that the claimant is not eligible for benefits, obviously then no benefits are due and therefore the when due provision cannot be violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.320" offset="544684">The issues that are here are one, whether Connecticut's administrative hearing which employs a seated interview system meets due process requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.871" offset="590869">And two, whether the District Court in determining this first issue erred in receiving in considering evidence which relates to the appeal period subsequent to the hearing in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.082" offset="639666">Facts generally here concern individuals who have filed an initial application for benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.744" offset="670386">They have satisfied the department that they have registered for work with the employment service and that they have met the wage credits requirement of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.250" offset="728377">In other words they have enough earned wages from a former employer prior to their unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.095" offset="755754">These people then go on a bi-weekly basis to the local office where they submit a form showing where they have gone to seek work during the past two weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.303" offset="804551">Now although they go every two weeks, statutes require a determination each week as to eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.462" offset="829210">When they go to this interviewer, the interviewer usually will ask some questions such as “did you earn any wages during this two-week period?</text>
            <text syncTime="190.873" offset="866826">Were you able to work during this period?”</text>
            <text syncTime="192.977" offset="875290">He will look at the form.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.989" offset="883336">If it seems as though he has made reasonable efforts during that week, he will receive his check.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.247" offset="912384">If a question is raised by what the claimant says or what is in that form, the claimant is then referred to another interviewer behind the counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.549" offset="949582">This is the fact-finding examiner who will then go into greater detail in discussing with the claimant what efforts he has made to seek work during those two weeks just ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.929" offset="999111">Now, that basically is the situation that is before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.400" offset="1016978">And as you can see, this situation is far different from that in Goldberg against Kelly.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.339" offset="1040697">The claimant here actually presents his case to the decision maker.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.811" offset="1058565">This was the “fatal flaw” which was found in the Goldberg case.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.891" offset="1082911">He is heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.771" offset="1094405">In the welfare cases, generally the recipient only has to establish need at the initial proceedings when he first applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.641" offset="1129932">He then proceeds to be paid unless and until his status changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.673" offset="1146023">In unemployment compensation cases, not only is there no needs test but the statutes providing for these benefits also require an affirmative duty on the part of each claimant to each week qualify for benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.245" offset="1212374">Now, would our Connecticut's procedures, which we submit meet due process requirements?</text>
            <text syncTime="282.435" offset="1233063">First, what do we mean by due process?</text>
            <text syncTime="285.685" offset="1246124">We submit the essence of due process is fairness, considering all the relevant factors, are Connecticut's procedures fair?</text>
            <text syncTime="294.111" offset="1279770">Let us see.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.941" offset="1283114">A moment ago Mr. Wasik, you said under Connecticut law, the claimant must each week qualify for the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.262" offset="1312371">Do you mean by that that each week he has to show that he has made some effort to obtain employment?</text>

            <text syncTime="309.446" offset="1341106">In Connecticut the claimant has notice of the interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.522" offset="1357511">When he first applies, he is given a booklet that is entitled “your rights and responsibilities,” under the Connecticut Unemployment Compensation Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.236" offset="1388335">As the name implies, the claimant has responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.926" offset="1407039">Not the first of which is to read this booklet which not only tells him what his obligations are but gives him helpful information as to how he can meet these obligations.</text>
