            <text syncTime="70.074" offset="385714">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.425" offset="399088">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.180" offset="422181">It arises out of petitioner's unsuccessful efforts to gain access to the Chattanooga, Tennessee Municipal Auditorium, in order to exhibit the rock-musical "Hair."</text>
            <text syncTime="91.368" offset="470873">“Hair” is a rock-musical which describes the lifestyle of many young people during the late 1960s and early 1970s and their attitudes on such matters as war, the Vietnam War, racism, drugs, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.827" offset="532731">In 1967, “Hair” opened in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.464" offset="551225">Since then, it is performed in 140 cities in the United States and 14 cities throughout the rest of the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.548" offset="579647">It has received widespread critical acclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.375" offset="598873">When petitioner began to produce “Hair” in the smaller communities in the Southeastern and Southwestern parts of the United States, it ran into considerable difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.312" offset="642654">In these smaller communities, the municipal auditorium frequently holds a strategic position.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.033" offset="669508">It is the only or the best available facility for the production of a major play and in these communities, many municipal officials were hostile to “Hair's” exhibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.001" offset="721439">In their brief, respondents put the matter as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.508" offset="735441">They say, “Many local officials in tune with the standards of their communities and particularly those in the so-called Bible belt, resisted the presentation of this notorious production” and claiming unlimited censorship rights to determine what should or what should not be shown in the municipal theater, these municipal officials refused “Hair” access to local auditoriums.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.849" offset="848812">Federal District Courts enjoined that conduct and those courts which did not do so were reversed upon appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.671" offset="880055">This case began in such a fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.453" offset="895206">“Hair” applied for use of the municipal facility in Chattanooga and these respondents refused “Hair” access because they testified, exhibition of “Hair” would not be and I quote “in the best interest of the community” nor would it be a play which they could characterize and I quote “as clean, healthful and culturally uplifting.”</text>

            <text syncTime="235.370" offset="1046925">They're all exclusion cases and we went to the appropriate U.S. District Courts and obtained orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.442" offset="1075137">Petitioner thereupon in this case filed a complaint in the District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee and taking the position that respondent's refusal to permit access to the theater should be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.802" offset="1132607">The District Court held an evidentiary hearing, which focused essentially on the question of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.296" offset="1158625">The District Judge agreed with the finding of an advisory jury that “Hair” was obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.395" offset="1182971">His findings are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.733" offset="1192375">The judge expressly conceded that taken as whole, “Hair” was not utterly without redeeming social value, applying the pre-Miller standard, but he held that a play must be divided into three categories first, speech; second, symbolic speech; and third, conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.702" offset="1280251">Under the judge's view, this last category, conduct is not within the freedom of speech protected by the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.384" offset="1314941">And that category, conduct, apparently includes virtually all the nonverbal aspects of a play.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.481" offset="1355379">Then the judge focused on “Hair's” conduct and he concluded that it was obscene under State Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.419" offset="1383069">The Sixth Circuit affirmed over the dissenting opinion of Judge MacRae.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.635" offset="1403967">Writing for the panel, Judge O'Sullivan expressly approved the speech conduct reasoning of the District Court and in addition, he went considerably beyond it.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.242" offset="1446390">Unlike the District Judge, Judge O'Sullivan found that “Hair” speech alone was obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.236" offset="1470318">Judge White concurred in a terse opinion simply saying that “Hair” involved only depraved sexual conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.469" offset="1503336">A rehearing en banc was denied and the petitioner then sought and obtained a writ of certiorari in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="437.419" offset="1855049">In the District Court, he first finds, by making this dichotomy between speech and conduct, he finds that the conduct is not protected by the free speech guarantee of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.970" offset="1901338">It's no different from conduct, which had occurred in the public street.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.439" offset="1915131">Now, from that analytical framework, what he does is he says, “Does this conduct violate any state law?”</text>
            <text syncTime="459.554" offset="1943656">And he finds two state laws which the conduct violates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1001.142" offset="4109939">Now, the response that's made to this essentially standards argument is a twofold one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.720" offset="4132300">The first response is that the respondents now take a position that he did not take in a District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.127" offset="4165945">They take the position here that the standards must be adequate for constitutional purposes, but they assert that the standards are adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.974" offset="4197292">But it's interesting that the standards that they refer to are public nudity and obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.499" offset="4219444">Now, I would suggest to the Court that those standards are insufficient for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.821" offset="4236685">First of all, neither nudity nor obscenity was the criterion actually used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.765" offset="4260509">There is only a single passing reference to nudity and there is none whatsoever to obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.686" offset="4284123">Pages 16 and 17 of our brief, reprint the relevant testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.274" offset="4302514">The criteria actually employed were something quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.143" offset="4317978">Now, as to the single reference to nudity, not only was it not used, if it were used it would be a constitutionally insufficient basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.459" offset="4355281">The decisions of this Court, not one of which is discussed by my brothers, are very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.588" offset="4383807">They've cited on page 30 of the brief, particularly Jenkins against Georgia, the recent obscenity opinion, California against LaRue where this Court recognized that there's a great deal of difference between nudity which occurs in a barroom or a public street and nudity occurring in a play.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.200" offset="4450262">In my judgment, nudity relevant to a dramatic performance cannot constitute a per se basis for prohibition and it's far too late in the day to argue otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.900" offset="4492999">Now, we think that what we have said entitles us to a judgment directing that the respondents make the municipal auditorium available for the production of “Hair.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.400" offset="4531033">But it's possible that on remand that this Court might conclude that the respondent's use of improper standards does not now foreclose them from using proper standards such as obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.560" offset="4579621">Respondent's counsel certainly insists upon that position and it takes the position he cannot enter into any kind of a contract with respect to quoted “obscene play.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.320" offset="4622670">In the new Tennessee obscenity legislation, quoted in this brief would support them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.321" offset="4642732">And so it would appear that the question of obscenity is not avoided even if the Court agrees with petitioner that the standards used were ultimately bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.751" offset="4680453">Since on remand, the respondents are going to press obscenity as a basis for denying access to “Hair” and the lower courts are going to sustain that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.907" offset="4717025">We therefore urge this Court to address itself to the question of the appropriate standards, not only to waste -- not only to prevent a waste of resources and judicial economy, but because of the widespread public interest in resolving this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.460" offset="4775225">There are very few plays that can afford the expensive litigation all the way to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3042.557" offset="12275608">To our knowledge, it has never been asserted that First Amendment freedoms permit nudity in public places and other phases of sexual misconduct much less require that the responsible public officials be mandated to allow them in the public's auditorium.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.512" offset="12351467">In O'Brien, if Your Honors will recall a draft -- a felon burned his draft card alleging that this was freedom of speech and this Court annunciated a four-part test which Judge Wilson found applied to this particular play.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.265" offset="12442478">He found that the state and local governments do have an interest under their respective police powers to make regulations concerning the public morals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.312" offset="12486677">He held as this Court later in the Paris Adult theater case that there is a long recognized legitimate state interest involved, i.e. stemming the tide of commercialized obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.826" offset="12540698">He further held that the city ordinance on public nudity and obscene acts and the Tennessee common law on indecent exposure are not regulations governing communication and are unrelated to the freedom of expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.277" offset="12598481">And he further found that the incidental restriction was no greater than what was essential to the furtherance of the state's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.762" offset="12632440">In this regard, I would point out that the city had no other means available to keep illicit conduct from occurring on stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.549" offset="12671624">Now, my brother has taken the position that before a law involving the public morals can be relied upon, it must meet obscenity standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.094" offset="12737766">We would respectfully dissent from this view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.196" offset="12750200">This is because such laws as laws directed at morals are not directed at speech activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.745" offset="12784368">Now, they are therefore not within the ambit of the First Amendment out of which all of the standards for obscenity have emanated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.955" offset="12817283">Thus, there can be no obscenity requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.751" offset="12832434">The First Amendment simply provides that Congress and through the Fourteenth Amendment, the municipalities and the states shall make no laws abridging freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.135" offset="12873916">Now, the law governing public nudity is not a law governing freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.472" offset="12899307">Pubic nudity is not speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.449" offset="12907248">It is conduct and subject to the police power of the states.</text>
