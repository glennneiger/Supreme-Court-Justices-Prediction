            <text syncTime="21.580" offset="189733">This is an appeal from a judgment from the United States District Court for the District of North Dakota, which established a permanent apportionment plan, that is permanent for 1970s, based on the 1970 decennial census.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.690" offset="266115">The judgment involves a plan that establishes five large multimember districts involving both houses of the North Dakota Legislature and involves a -- in terms of population variances in excessive 20% and in overall average, I think in plus and minus 5% or an average of 10% variance.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.461" offset="397249">The issues that we present, first of all, involve the issue of whether a court in fashioning a plan and absent any contrary state policy which support the establishment of multimember districts or unusual or unique circumstances, could deny the appellants the equitable remedy of single member districting.</text>

            <text syncTime="116.213" offset="568195">You are asking us to review not a plan enacted by the legislature of the state, but to review a plan mandated some five, six, seven years ago by a federal district court, is that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="153.089" offset="715734">This is not a review of a plan that has been adopted by the North Dakota Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.422" offset="737050">The facts basically are that following the 1970 census, the legislative assembly in North Dakota failed to adopt a plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.016" offset="775398">We started this lawsuit in federal court, asking for a reapportionment, based on the substantial changes in population within in the state of North Dakota, basically a shift from rural to urban areas, under the Equal Protection Clause and the decisions of this Court and then we are also in that case requested pursuant to Connor v. Johnson, the application of the equitable remedy of single-member districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.459" offset="897233">In North Dakota, the tradition was from statehood until the mid 1960s a tradition based on a constitutional provision, specifically Section 29, that Senatorial districts where to be represented by one senator and no more.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.954" offset="1027218">Now the Constitution, until these provisions were voided by decisions of the Federal Court in the mid 1960s, did provide, had a restriction on the establishment of Senate districts in that you couldn't break up a county attached part of one county to another county to form a Senate district.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.651" offset="1121991">You could take two, two counties and make one district, but you couldn't breakup a county.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.221" offset="1144247">You could also breakup county as long as no part of the county was attached to another.</text>

            <text syncTime="303.372" offset="1316864">Well, no the basic thrust of the amendment was not to establish single districts, it was to establish a constitutional apportionment commission and it was presented to the people of North Dakota as this was a -- going to provide a way of apportioning the state legislature taking this power from the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.353" offset="1404740">And the Attorney General who was responsible for with the Secretory State for specifying what this constitutional amendment provided, that was the thrust of the amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="446.524" offset="1889468">Well, originally two members of the three-member court, Judge Van Sickle decided that adopted it only as an interim plan, saying after the 1972 elections the special masters were referred on a permanent plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.250" offset="1964387">They expressed substantial interest in what was called the Ostenson plan which was another plan that had been proposed by one of the Special Masters.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.917" offset="2003048">But then after the elections, there were some delays for the elections, that one of which Mr. Justice Douglas referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.296" offset="2032515">I might point out that at that election where the proposed constitutional amendments were rejected by the core of the people, the people also rejected a legislative plan that had been passed by the North Dakota legislative assembly which provided for multimember districts much like the Dobson plan and that was voted down.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.345" offset="2116733">So, I don't think that you can work to the election results in North Dakota, the special elections that were conducted in December of 1973 and say this establishes a state policy in favor of multimember districts are really in opposition because the people voted no on both issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="538.281" offset="2256541">What we are asking for is, on this issue, is a reversal with corrections to follow the supervisory directive that this Court gave in -- first in Connor v. Johnson and has reiterated that when a court is called upon to fashion a reapportionment plan in the absence of some contrary state policy or specially in unique circumstances that you should do so on the basis of single-member districts.</text>

            <text syncTime="574.741" offset="2402304">Right, it is not -- we're not submitting this issue on the basis that it is a constitutional requirement, but it is the general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.095" offset="2439711">Now in the Whitcomb case from Indiana there was an exception recognized based on a Indiana constitutional provision that said you're not going to break up counties to establish Senate Districts and as I understand the Whitcomb case, there was a recognition that the general rule which is an equitable remedy, had to give way in view of this legitimate state policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.742" offset="2554337">But in North Dakota we don't have any, either a constitutional or a statutory policy that would favor multimember districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.999" offset="2587355">The second exception which I think the court recognized in the Virginia case was that unique or unusual circumstances can justify multimember districts in a court fashioned plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.280" offset="2644511">And in this case we're not saying that there maybe unique circumstances that will require some type of multimember districts to handle the situation which is really quite equivalent to that involved in the Virginia case.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.312" offset="2708668">We have got substantial military personal at the Grand Forks Air Force Base and at Minot Air Force Base and if in fact based on an analysis which Dakota called upon the masters to make about how to proposals or as to how to handle a military personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.773" offset="2778467">If in fact that unique situation would justify an adoption of a plan that would provide for some type multimember districting to handle the military personal at the two bases then that's fine, we're not going to -- we're not arguing with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.187" offset="2848162">But what we were saying is, is that absent a state policy and absent special or unique circumstances, this Court should enforce the rule that it established not as a constitutional matter, but as a matter of superintending direction over the district courts and the inferior courts to give us what is the equitable remedy of the single-member districting.</text>

            <text syncTime="748.824" offset="3098624">And I think under those circumstances, it would be unsound to draw an inference at this somehow represents a support as far as state policy goes for multimember districts.</text>

            <text syncTime="780.513" offset="3225475">We never had this kind of districting in North Dakota until the mid 1960s at which time the court established large multimember districts and in doing so they said well if there is any problem, the legislature can handle it.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.818" offset="3290676">Well the legislature is been handling it and struggling with it for 10 years and they have never been able to resolve it because obviously the effect of this kind of districting is that one party tends to win all the seats, and 8 days ago there was somewhat of a changed situation and in terms of larger multimember districts, five senators from the one party were all lost to the other party.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.682" offset="3422124">But it seems to me that in terms of political fairness, and we're not talking about political fairness basically to the parties, but to the people.</text>

            <text syncTime="1546.716" offset="6290265">In the few remaining moments if there, I would also point out that the second issue involves population disparities and these disparities in this plan exceed those that were involved in the Virginia case and there is contrary to the Virginia case, no justifiable state policy that would support the type of deviations we're involved with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.910" offset="6383052">The two that were offered were a bit -- there is a geographic barrier, the Missouri River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.518" offset="6401442">Indeed it is a geographic barrier, but it provides no barrier at all to the establishment of equal population districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.767" offset="6438431">That is not a problem and that's covered in detail in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.834" offset="6450657">The second point was is that North Dakota is a small agricultural rural state and it is just not that important to get precise districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.182" offset="6496110">Well, North Dakota has a traditional that it carried on at this last election of having extremely close election results and the individual's voting power in a small state, the one person's vote really can have a substantial impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.757" offset="6566431">And with the type of issues that are going to be presented to the North Dakota legislature involving not only the future of North Dakota, but large parts of the nation involving the development of resources, it seems to me that equity and fairness and to say nothing of the Constitution, requires a better job of drawing districts lines in terms of establishing fair apportionment within the Dobson Plan, which was basically designed to meet an emergency and had as one of its standards to draw the new lines as closely as you could to the existing lines which were being stricken because they provided a representation that was violative of the Equal Protection Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1674.793" offset="6802578">Counsel has stated the historic development fairly accurately, but I believe he listed somethings as being no more technical than the real practical situation as it existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.258" offset="6856391">Prior to 1965, true, North Dakota had a senatorial district and they had multimember house districts and it was basically on the county setup.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.249" offset="6924413">The counties could not be taken and attached to another part of a county, but could be moved together, several counties could be comprised to consist one senatorial district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.574" offset="6973628">But, in the more populous counties, the county could be divided and in fact there were several that were divided in which the legislature created one, two or three senatorial districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.656" offset="7034023">But, in those districts that were created, the county remained as the basic unit and for all practical purposes in the legislature and in discussion of the senators that we referred to as the Senators from Cass County even though Cass County had two senatorial districts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1797.691" offset="7294098">Even though the ordinary reference was to the county, but in some counties we had more than one senatorial district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.593" offset="7329729">And true, the legislature has toiled with this problem and has made some very sincere efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.027" offset="7363480">But about in 1960 through our constitutional process, a constitutional amendment was adopted, which froze the senatorial districts as they existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.160" offset="7411963">It also created a board which was charged with a duty of reapportioning the state if the legislature failed to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.173" offset="7444041">This board consisted of the two majority leaders of each House, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Chief Justice of a state of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.973" offset="7499316">They labored with this problem, long and heavy, but because of provisions of Section 35, it was just impossible to do what the language provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.286" offset="7564518">And as a result of that a reapportionment plan that was adopted by this committee was declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.216" offset="7596283">And then from there the actions were brought in the Federal Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.270" offset="7616449">And then from 1965, we have developed a different pattern, and this is where the Federal District Court fashioned plan, provided for senatorial districts with more than one senator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.085" offset="7683741">But the ratio was for each senator they would have two representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.811" offset="7710595">Now, this plan stayed in existence, and the legislature in 1971 did not reapportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.582" offset="7753749">There were feeble efforts made, but if I can summarize some of comments made by the legislators, they said, we just don't know where to go, what we can do, and some even said, well let the court do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.290" offset="7820518">Well, these are some of the difficulties for the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.836" offset="7858761">When this action was initially brought and a temporary plan established a bi-partisan committee was created for the purposes of proposing a plan to the 1973 legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.400" offset="7932949">This committee worked hard and long and developed what I would say a very god plan, as far as the variance, but because it contained multimember districts the Governor vetoed the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.703" offset="8002226">It was overridden and then referred to the people, about the same an initiated constitutional measure was submitted to the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.423" offset="8053112">This measure provided for a board to reapportion the state, and also provided that the board provide for single-member districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.199" offset="8120195">Now, when the people rejected both of these measures, we had to assume that the people were in effect saying leave us be, let's us have the plan that we have now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.898" offset="8182993">The constant changing of boundary lines I believe, hurts representative form of government more so or equally so than the variance in population.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.962" offset="8239208">Identification with the district lines is an essential element of representation and the people when they rejected the Court -- no, the legislative plan, my impression was that was rejected because it broke entirely too many county lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.777" offset="8358431">To say that was rejected because it had multimember districts flies in the face of the people's rejection of the constitutional measure which would have provided for single-member districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.295" offset="8412557">And on that basis, we are representing the people of the state of North Dakota even though counsel may have some reservations about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.016" offset="8463444">The Secretary of State, of course is a state constitutional officer, and the Attorney General by law and by common law in the state of North Dakota represents the people there though we have no reservation whatsoever that the Attorney General and the Secretary of State Van Meier representing the people of the state of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.133" offset="8563858">So historically, we have consistently had multimember districts for the House to the State of North Dakota and from 1965 we have had multimember districts for the Senate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2134.827" offset="8642644">Now, prior to the court's Intervention and they are recognizing also that Section 35 of this constitutional menu which prose the districts, I think of that point the state actually operated what we would refer to as a little Federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.724" offset="8710248">The Senate had area, the House was on population, even though the counties in the several instances were gathered together to make an area and in another instances counties were divided to make an area, but it was still basically a concept of the little federal system.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul M. Sand</label>
            <text syncTime="2245.570" offset="9085680">In the larger counties like Cass, Grand Forks, Barnes, Richland, Ward and the larger counties or the counties that had the larger cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.482" offset="9177318">We also believe that where the legislature -- where the court is required to fashion a plan, that the court should fashion a plan which is somewhat patterned after the state plan in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.074" offset="9255685">Now true, a plan can be developed which would cut down the variance, but in order to accomplish that and at the same kind maintain some respect for county lines, we'd have to reduce the number of Senators and Representatives, the Legislative Bodies as a whole would have to be reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.287" offset="9352547">But as far as the number of Senators and Representatives, I think this is basically the judgment of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.241" offset="9384312">We have had consistently representation in the House from 98 to 101 or in that vicinity and 49 to 51 in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.187" offset="9452126">Now, if the court would have gone to a reduced number, yes our variances may not be that great, but I think the number should be respected because it gives a greater division amongst the electorate and in the same way it also gives members in the House and the Senate which are more responsive to that particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.896" offset="9575006">And again in North Dakota the County is the basic political sub division.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.774" offset="9602487">The county performs many many functions for and on behalf of the state and to break up the county lines actually destroys the responsiveness to the county needs and on the variance, they find it a little difficult to attempt to speak about accuracy or exactness in population when we know that the initial census is not accurate in itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.386" offset="9756923">As this Court has said, it is a process, but it is not necessarily accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.660" offset="9785971">We have in our brief set out, a few of the cities which have had a census taken since the 1970 census and we find that quite a few of them have grown substantially and in one instance, where the variance was 11% by taking the new population, it has been reduced to 4%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.058" offset="9887640">And it would seemed to me that it would be somewhat inequitable to require an exact mathematical formula based upon a figure which is initially not accepted as being correct and then go from there, when it's reasonably understood that in the matter of a year or two, those population figures will no longer be representative, and we operated on that for a 10-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.445" offset="10025148">And in the State of North Dakota, under the situation that we have here, I would submit that a population variance of 20% or in that area is not out of line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.099" offset="10087737">We have the natural barrier to contend with and I think the Court in this instance, there are people from the state, they know the needs, they know the area, they came up with a plan that is satisfactory to the State of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.711" offset="10178226">And if I may just simply repeat that when the elections on the initiated measure, constitutional measure and the referendum on the legislative plan were rejected by the people, the people were in fact saying, leave us be as we are created.</text>

            <text syncTime="2616.928" offset="10571107">I don't recall whether in any opinions of the Court, we have ever distinguished between -- in percentages between large area like New York and California and a smaller state like North Dakota, but if my arithmetic is correct and I don't vouch for it, the variation per senator, elected from the highest to the lowest is only 786 votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.476" offset="10693256">786 voters; that is 11,775 in the 29th district to 12,561 in the 18th district, that's on page 3 of your brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.184" offset="10784057">Now, having said that and if my arithmetic is correct, which I am not sure it is, do you think the Court ought to have – ought to exert much bigger flexibility dealing with a small number of voters than with a percentage that would make a variation of hundreds and thousands?</text>

            <text syncTime="2726.210" offset="11008188">And reason why we believe that this variation is justifiable because we have had a constant change in population.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.715" offset="11054268">Ironically, we've had up until 1970 a decrescent population, but also a change from world to urban within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.658" offset="11102020">But from 1970 to 1974, according to the latest report in the US World News based upon the US census, the state of North Dakota has gained since 1970, a little better than 4% population.</text>

            <text syncTime="2786.471" offset="11249246">In response to question that Mr. Justice Blackmun asked Mr. Sand, I would point out that the one senator tor two house member ratio has been overall the standard since statehood Your Honor except insofar as our original Constitution provided that both houses should be -- districts should be of equal populations to the extent that, that could be done, but the problem was that since there was a restriction in senate districts and not taking part of one county and making it part of a senate district that involved another county, that were necessarily population imbalances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.359" offset="11432835">And in order to correct that situation, certain districts were given additional house members, but the vast majority of districts since statehood have always had two house members and one senator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.111" offset="11491767">And so that well it's been an absolute tradition of one senator and two house members, the overall tradition is clearly on that kind of a basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.661" offset="11533981">Insofar as Mr. Chief Justice, your reference to the disparities in populations, based under Dobson plan, I think we're talking about between in terms of people just about something between 2400 and 2500 people difference between the largest or most under represented district or smallest or more over-- most representative district and I think there was an appendix --</text>
