            <text syncTime="15.366" offset="164864">Mr. Chief Justice and associate justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.859" offset="182836">This case involves the plain meaning of the federal Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968, and more specifically with the Section 1867 (d) and (f), which deals with the challenging compliance with selection procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.453" offset="269145">In essence, the issue in this case is, did the federal trial court error when they denied a motion to inspect the master list and the -- rather master and qualified wheel under 28 U.S.C. 1867 (d) upon a timely motion accompanied with a sworn affidavit alleging noncompliance with the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.179" offset="392129">In that, there was a systematic exclusion of Spanish surname persons qualified for jury duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.031" offset="431522">There's a subsidiary question which I don't feel it's necessary to reach, but it's implicit in the briefs and that is, is this form of requested relief, statutory relief, under the Act, separate from a constitutional or collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.594" offset="509785">And the answer to both questions is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.229" offset="524309">The facts in this case are undisputed prior to the trial of a drug case; counsel filed a motion to dismiss the indictment and a motion to inspect the jury wheels.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.324" offset="588675">And pursuant to the statute, he filed an affidavit of an experience that he had in Boulder, Colorado which is a county, city and county about 20 miles from Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.237" offset="656280">And in that -- he had a case before the state court, and at that time the state law mimicked the federal Jury Selection and Service Act and that it utilized the voting registration list as a basic source list.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.950" offset="735169">And the affidavit that I filed is contained in the appendix in the -- page 15, and in essence without going through the appendix, the conclusion was that this group, that the Spanish surnamed group were underrepresented by over 50%.</text>

            <text syncTime="189.562" offset="861602">In this case and in others where we always have references to people with Spanish surnames, suppose a woman named Perez marries a man named Jones, now their offspring is not a person with a Spanish surname if they follow our system --</text>

            <label>Mr. Walter L. Gerash</label>
            <text syncTime="208.263" offset="936417">Well, relying on human nature, it's self-corrective because the opposite sex does the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.874" offset="962853">And so we -- statistically taking usually take care of that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.259" offset="988453">It cancels one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.693" offset="994095">It's really not a problem statistically.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="223.960" offset="999215">Question number two, you motion it seems to me is directed to persons with Spanish surnames and students and blacks using your phrase, and then later, persons under the age of 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.818" offset="1062640">And then in your affidavit, you speak to Spanish surnames and used under 30 and students and workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.199" offset="1104123">I wonder whether there's a little inconsistency between the supporting affidavit and the motion.</text>

            <text syncTime="257.281" offset="1132544">Well, what happened is of course this Court certified the issue to be Spanish surnames and did not certify a age grouping or in this case blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.654" offset="1169951">Of course, in this specific case, being denied the list we couldn't make any statistical analysis in the federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.291" offset="1208508">But the affidavit -- there was testimony by Professor Bargrow from the University of Denver to the effect that these groups were also underrepresented.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.362" offset="1252812">But that wasn't -- of course that is not the issue before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.503" offset="1265351">The Court only certified the Spanish surname cognizable group under Hernandez versus Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="839.006" offset="3459427">The Act enables lawyers both the Government and the defense attorneys in 1867 on page 9 (a) of the plaintiff's, or rather the petitioner's brief wherein it talks about challenging compliance with the selection procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.202" offset="3532152">It clearly gives both sides to file motions seven days prior to trial, and it gives them the parties in a case shall be allowed to inspect, reproduce and copy such records of papers at all reasonable times during the preparation and pendency of such a motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.850" offset="3618774">The Act recognizes that this is an exclusive means by which a person accused of a federal crime, or the Attorney General of the United States or civil party may challenge any jury in that he was not selected in conformity with any of the provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.424" offset="3697037">And there're many other provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="919.690" offset="3782092">So we claim in this case that not only that we conform to the literally, to the statute, but we alleged the constitutional dimension that we felt that we would be able to prove if we were allowed into the hearing room and took a look at the statistics.</text>

            <text syncTime="1199.381" offset="4900864">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.510" offset="4913403">The United States finds itself into somewhat unusual position of agreeing with the petitioner on the only issue which we consider to be ripe for review in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.699" offset="4958124">That is, it is our position that there is an unqualified right under the Jury Selection Act to inspect the jury lists, and that the District Court denial of petitioner’s motion to inspect in this case was error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.067" offset="5019669">And we do not believe that it can be properly characterized as harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.559" offset="5041612">We think there’s an unqualified right to inspect the list because the statute accord such a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.184" offset="5068152">Section 1867 (f) explicitly states that the party shall be allowed to inspect and copy all records used in the jury selection process, and the jury list are of course such records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.355" offset="5132831">In the legislative history confirms that the statute means exactly what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.021" offset="5155506">Moreover, we believe inspection of the list is necessary to an effective utilization of the Act to challenge procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.797" offset="5190510">I would like to correct something Mr. Gerash said in his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.642" offset="5209945">I have seen better affidavits than Mr. Gerash’ affidavit, but I do say that it is unlikely that counsel to be able to come up with a better affidavit, unless he can see the jury list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.935" offset="5263130">Now, there had been occasional cases which have indicated that the sworn statement, which is required by 1867 (a), is a precondition to inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.822" offset="5318614">But we believe those decisions are plainly wrong because 1837 (f) says that you can inspect the list in preparation of a motion under 1867 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.359" offset="5368769">Now, under right inspection does not impose an undue administrative burden, and District Court clerk need only maintain a copy of the list available for inspection, and we do not think for an inspection will be used for delay because the time periods imposed by the Act effectively preclude that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.709" offset="5446196">And we do not think there is any substantial risk that inspection will be used for tampering because the sheer number of names on the master and qualified list would effectively preclude that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.201" offset="5496142">We do not have a comprehensive survey of District Courts, but based on informal survey of United States attorneys who we deal with, we believe that most District Courts presently allow inspections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.408" offset="5549014">Now, whether or not the error can be deemed harmless in this case depends on an analysis of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.895" offset="5586944">If the Act is read as being directed solely to prevention of systematic exclusion or purposeful discrimination, then we believe here was harmless because the petitioner sole claim was that the use of registered voter list in Colorado gives rise to a significant under-representation of certain groups, primarily Mexican-Americans or persons with Spanish surnames.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.623" offset="5693837">Now, as I will explain in a minute, we don't think the Act can be read in that way, but it does have brought our purposes that if we assume for the moment that it is directed at systematic exclusion, petitioner does not state such a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.252" offset="5760397">The federal jury plan contemplates the use of registered voter list as the source for perspective jurors, and the random selection is the method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.283" offset="5800521">And that system is in sharp contrast with the jury procedures that have been founded constitutes systematic exclusion in this Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.019" offset="5835421">Those systems, usually involved a source for jurors that was not racially neutral and they involved a subjective selection method, and they produced one of two results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.952" offset="5883173">They either produce a total exclusion of a group such as in Norris against Alabama, where no Negro had served on a grand or petty jury in the memory of living witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.272" offset="5924446">Or they produced a progressive decimation of a class at each stage of the process, such as in Alexander against Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.461" offset="5961226">That systematic exclusion denies a member of a group an opportunity to participate, and as this Court held in Peters against Kiff, it stigmatizes the class excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.504" offset="6009396">Voter list do not exclude anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.557" offset="6021622">Any person qualified to vote may simply by registering, obtain the opportunity be considered for jury service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.129" offset="6055894">Now the federal selection system resembles fairly closely the jury selection procedure that was in issue in Brown against Allen, which is reported at 443 United States Reports, involving at Forsyth County North Carolina system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.806" offset="6122559">And there, tax list were used as the source for perspective jurors, and the names were drawn by lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.740" offset="6158294">And this Court held there was no constitutional violation merely because Negroes were underrepresented in proportion to the numbers in the population, so long as the selection procedures were fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.507" offset="6209390">Congress could constitutionally had made voter list conclusive, but they did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.866" offset="6238856">And on 18 -- Section 1863 (b) of the Act, Congress provided that the voter list were to be supplemented whenever necessary to foster the policies of 1861, the fair cross section, and 1862, the prevention of discrimination.</text>
