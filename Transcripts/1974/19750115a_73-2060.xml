            <text syncTime="489.047" offset="2059577">The State of New Hampshire has raised before this Court the question of standing and we would say that we answer that very simply, we advanced it in our brief but we say that this is the case of a taxpayer which is questioning the imposition of a tax or question the statute which imposes a tax upon the taxpayer and not to question that is so often come before this Court of a taxpayer questioning the spending of taxpayer’s funds and we submit that that is quite a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.598" offset="2201788">We feel that the taxpayer always has a right to challenge the constitutional validity of a statute under which he is taxed.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.161" offset="2252048">In the Allied Stores case, which is cited in our brief, which was an Ohio case which is similar in almost all respects except that that was not an income tax, it was an Ad Velorem tax in that case and the very question I think that was raised a moment ago here by the Court was decided in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.326" offset="2348701">That was a case where Allied Stores of Ohio was a resident corporation and they were taxed on merchandise and storage under the provisions of the Ohio statute, merchandise that were kept in storage by non-residents that were not taxed, under the equal protection clause, they brought it to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.679" offset="2426128">They brought it to this Court after the Supreme Court of the State of Ohio had denied standing saying that it didn’t make any difference to the taxpayer in that case that if they struck out that proviso as to the non-resident proviso that nevertheless they would be subject to the same amount of tax and this Court said that they had standing to raise the issue and then went on and decided the constitutional issues in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.941" offset="2535111">We say that we are in exactly at the same standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.700" offset="2546186">We say also that we have a -- was subject to injury under the statute because the petitioners here, the appellants in this case as I have pointed out would get the benefit of their tax dollar in the State of Maine or reduction of taxes in the State of Maine if their tax dollar was retained by that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.143" offset="2639914">I think we have to understand the background of standing as we are talking about it, we have to understand something about the New Hampshire statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.232" offset="2676276">The New Hampshire statute does not tax the income of the residents of New Hampshire in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.013" offset="2715460">It pretends to tax the income of New Hampshire residents working in another state, but I say, I use the word pretend because they make two exemptions which literally destroys the taxation provision because they make the first exemption that if the other state imposes a tax, then that New Hampshire resident is not subject to a income tax in the State of New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.984" offset="2839280">And if the other state does not impose a tax on income, then likewise, the New Hampshire resident is not subject to a tax in the State of New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.378" offset="2876897">So that under no conceivable condition can a New Hampshire resident be taxed on his income in the State of New Hampshire.</text>

            <text syncTime="1792.997" offset="7275395">In our view, this case does not involve any novel issues of constitutional law, although it maybe said to raise some familiar principles in a new configuration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.708" offset="7314160">It’s my objective here today to demonstrate that this new configuration is not an occasion for this Court to depart from those familiar principles and that a logical application of these principles compels a conclusion that the decision of the New Hampshire Supreme Court should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.938" offset="7383124">Now, the principal contention which we urge upon this Court and have set out in the brief is that the appellants suffer no injury, in fact, by the imposition of the New Hampshire commuter’s income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.246" offset="7448325">We are asserting that this tax is in fact a balanced provision, designed to reach non-residents for a ratable contribution in support of the Government, this is the language which appeared in Shaffer v. Carter and I think is a settled principle upon which a state can tax non-residents upon income earned within its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.301" offset="7540590">I think it appropriate to say at this point that the appellant’s description of the operation of the tax, although I’ve frankly concede that the provision which he labels a sham in fact does not reach any state resident with any tax burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.143" offset="7623973">Yet I would stop short of labeling it a sham because if you read the taxing statute in its entirety, you see that in fact a tax is imposed sticking to the strictly legal effect of the word imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.672" offset="7694085">A tax is imposed on residents and non-residents alike.</text>

            <text syncTime="1957.651" offset="7933994">In that light, the law of New Hampshire is of interest because we do not permit a desperate rate of taxation upon the same classification of property, that is to say we could not have a graduated income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.992" offset="7999300">So statutes in New Hampshire tend to pay close attention to the description of the classification of the income or the classification rather of the property which in this case is income earned in a state, not of the residents of the person earning it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.415" offset="8089057">The point I’m trying to make is quite simple that quite apart from the fact that the provision purporting to tax New Hampshire residents never in fact does so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.735" offset="8130330">Nevertheless, the effect of that statute -- of that part of the statute is that it does not alter the tax burden of any resident.</text>

            <text syncTime="2234.077" offset="9039705">A recent case in New Jersey considered the New Jersey’s counterpart Fiat, that case was brought here and was recently dismissed by this Court for one of a substantial federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.661" offset="9094040">The holding in that case out of New Jersey was in the case where a fee was assessed by the State of New Jersey on trucks operating in interstate commerce which were not registered in New Jersey, the Fee is assessed to the extent that and in the amount that state of registration of that track would tax a New Jersey truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.892" offset="9190902">And the Court went into great length and great detail in discussing the question of so called retaliatory statutes and hinted that maybe that was an inappropriate label for such a statute because in fact the effect of them is to further and encourage reciprocity and comity between states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.948" offset="9275120">I think the New Hampshire statute has a considerable element of that nature to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.738" offset="9306363">In fact, Section 6 of the New Hampshire Act provides that the taxing administrator may enter into it, reciprocity agreement which -- under which we would cease to tax the nonresident from that state if they would cease to tax residents of New Hampshire working in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.582" offset="9397687">Under that -- under those terms, since Maine now taxes New Hampshire residents, we would be in a position to say if you stop taxing New Hampshire residents, we will stop taxing Maine residents and then every body would be free to go home and tax their own people an that would be the end of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.164" offset="9476054">So I think that that’s the direct answer to your question I think Your Honor that the statute, this statute, the New Jersey statutes as illustrated in the brief filed by the State of New Jersey, all operate to encourage reciprocity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.285" offset="9544495">In the mean time, I do not deny obviously that they raise revenue for the State of New Hampshire nor what I’ve suspect, New Jersey deny that they raise revenue for the State of New Jersey but the force behind them and one of the theories upon which they can be sustained is that they do encourage comity and they do encourage reciprocity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.482" offset="9621295">The history of the New Jersey statute is very enlightening in that respect because it started off on the basis of reciprocity and was converted by the State of New York changing its credit arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.874" offset="9702902">Moving on, we suggest that the facts adduced by the brief filed by the State of Maine referred to the citizens, all the citizens of Maine and just those subject to the commuter’s income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.821" offset="9774686">Plus it shows that even that impact, that injury if there is any, a secondary having first passed through the treasury of the State of Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.172" offset="9828080">Now, I say that addressing the point that to the extent that there is any additional tax burden upon the residents of Maine because of the loss of revenue by the State of Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.403" offset="9876982">It is one de minimis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.371" offset="9888893">The State of Maine itself adduces the fact that of the record and in its brief that the total -- the net increase in burden for instance upon each citizen is $00.40.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.337" offset="9928704">I would submit that that simply does not rise to the level of injury which ought to permit this Court to overrule a taxing statute of a sovereign state on grounds for instance of equal protection or for that matter privileges and immunities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2616.102" offset="10567764">I’m maintaining that it does not in that it is de minimis and it’s part of -- part and parcel of the -- what the Court in prior decisions has labeled the necessary administrative burden of collecting -- assessing and collecting a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.966" offset="10631189">I should point out in a case of a tax upon non-residents that in fact the withholding provision is just about the only way that the state who is collecting the tax can be assured of getting it since if the cash has let out of the state, the collection then becomes an out of state proceeding and it’s very difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.515" offset="10705481">The case of Travis v.

            <text syncTime="2672.069" offset="10791685">Moving on, I assert that the injury which exists here by virtue of the in fact diversion of revenue is an injury which belongs to the State of Maine, to be asserted by the State of Maine if by anybody at all and that to that extent, this case brought by taxpayers is more in the nature of political question and an attempt by the taxpayers to litigate the interest of other parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="2787.367" offset="11252799">There’s no question what this Court has different standards to apply when considering the question of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.688" offset="11282160">Just to begin with, it must consider the fact that this Court’s jurisdiction is limited by the Constitution to actual cases and controversies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.185" offset="11320090">And I think that one of the elements which this Court should consider in deciding the extent to which this is really a case in which these plaintiffs have an interest is the fact that the expressions of interest in this case by other states specifically, Vermont, Maine and New Jersey, if one measure just how much an interest the states have in the outcome of this, and is again a measure of the extent to which this is really a contest between various states for the right to collect revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.329" offset="11492707">Moving on again, I think it follows almost immediately in the wake of our contention that there is no injury in fact here that as we have been discussing, the appellants have no standing to prosecute this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.240" offset="11552371">Trying to condense this point slightly, I think its one book law that standing to litigate a constitutional issue requires a demonstrable injury in fact upon which the complaint maybe founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.602" offset="11609736">This requirement as I mentioned is a part and parcel of the constitutional limitation with respect to cases and controversies, but also I think reflects fundamental fact that the Constitution is not designed to settle specific disputes, but rather provides certain broad and rights and privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.741" offset="11702314">Thus, a complaint under the Constitution is primarily a complaint about conduct which results in a deprivation or infringement of a right or privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.618" offset="11745886">In other words, if there is no injury, there is no deprivation and the complaint should not -- a complainant, excuse me, should not be heard to say that there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.922" offset="11791026">This illustrates the extent to which in my brief I have tried to tie together the argument, that there is no injury with the argument, that there is no standing with the argument, that there is no deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.297" offset="11848600">In this particular circumstance, I think the whole thing turns on the question of the injury.</text>
