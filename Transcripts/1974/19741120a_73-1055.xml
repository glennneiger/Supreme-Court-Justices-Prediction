            <text syncTime="77.947" offset="415117">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.923" offset="431104">These cases are here on direct appeal from the judgment of a three-judge court sitting in the Western District of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.561" offset="461615">That Court set aside orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission, granting certificates of convenience and necessity to three motor carriers for service between points in the southeastern and southwestern states.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.762" offset="514382">The United States and the Commission bring this appeal because we believe that the District Court, erroneous to relying on this Court's decision in Overton Park, has misapplied the Administrative Procedure Act in a fashion which fundamentally alters the scope of review of administrative findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.409" offset="585017">And, because of limitations of time, I do not intend to discuss the prior history of these cases in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.316" offset="612603">That history has set forth at pages three through eight of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.506" offset="629426">I do, however, want to make a few brief comments about the prior proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.500" offset="649383">These cases are now nine years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.085" offset="659728">They originally involved 10 applications for motor carrier service in the area generally lying to the east of Houston, Dallas, and Fort Worth, Texas into the west of Atlanta, Georgia, Birmingham, Alabama and Pensacola, Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.373" offset="720854">Hearings began on these consolidated applications in early 1966 and were held before two examiners in eight cities, primarily in the southeast.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.388" offset="764949">The hearings consumed 149 days and over 900 witnesses appeared and testified in support of the applications with some 60 witnesses testifying in opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.092" offset="811760">66 rail and motor carriers appeared as protestants to the applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.135" offset="831927">The transcript of the proceedings exceeds 23,000 pages and the documentary exhibits, number almost 2,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.006" offset="863378">This was, as the Commission found, probably the most extensive record ever compiled in a motor carrier operating rights case.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.631" offset="893889">In November of 1969, the examiners rendered their report, recommending that all of the applications be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.072" offset="923669">Exceptions were taken to their report and the case was considered by the Commission Division I.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.098" offset="947806">In December 30, 1971, the Commission issued its decision finding that present or future public need justified the grant of three of the certificates and accordingly, Certificates of Convenience and Necessity were granted to three carriers: Red Ball, Bowman, and Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.702" offset="1018232">In September of 1972, motions for reconsideration were denied by the Commission by a 2:1 vote and a petition that the case be heard by the entire Commission as involving a matter of general transportation importance was also denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.842" offset="1074761">In October of 1972, 19 protestants filed suit in the District Court and approximately a year later, in September 1973, the District Court set aside the Commission orders, finding that the Commission's evaluation of certain of the evidence was arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.406" offset="1148949">Now, before discussing the scope of review question, I would like to deal with one preliminary matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="297.887" offset="1294921">It's Finding 11, yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.422" offset="1309027">The Court finds that the Commission's decision fails to meet the requisites of clarity and as an illustration, it says that it cannot determine whether the Commission rejected or approved the examiner's principal findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.269" offset="1372453">The District Court's finding is clearly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.327" offset="1384678">The Commission's ultimate conclusions and subordinate findings are set forth in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.067" offset="1407666">Its ultimate conclusions appear at page 158 to 160 of the appendix, and its subordinate findings appear as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.516" offset="1441416">Commission, like the examiners, determined that all the applicants were fit and able to perform the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.605" offset="1465762">That finding appears at page 121 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.423" offset="1481017">The Commission differed with the examiners on whether there was a public need for the service authorized, and the Commission's findings appear at pages 128 to 131 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.279" offset="1528456">Now, the District Court's conclusion is based in part on its labeling the appendices to the examiners and Commission's report as findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.277" offset="1576521">They are not findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.851" offset="1582791">Those appendices contain summaries of the testimony and exhibits introduced in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.737" offset="1606301">They contain no inferences or conclusions drawn from the evidence, and I think the clearest indication that they are not findings is that no party to this case objects to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.163" offset="1644022">The District Court found that they present a comprehensive summary of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.753" offset="1662412">We believe they do and they are not findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.665" offset="1686026">Now, in considering the scope of review question, it is important to keep in mind what this case does and does not involve.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.239" offset="1716328">There is no question here the Commission statutory authority to issue certificates of the legal criteria governing the issuance of such certificates or the propriety of procedures used by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.156" offset="1763976">The only question is whether the Commission erred in finding that there is a present or future need for the service proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.554" offset="1797622">That is an essentially factual question and judicial review of the Commission's determination is, in our view, governed by the substantial evidence test.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.085" offset="1839731">Our position as to the scope of review is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.579" offset="1853733">Judicial review of the evidentiary basis of findings made on a record after hearing is governed by the substantial evidence test.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.112" offset="1883826">The arbitrary and capricious test does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.454" offset="1897200">That is not to say that the arbitrary capricious test has no application in adjudicatory proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.087" offset="1919770">As we say in our brief, there are many actions taken in such proceedings that would be subject to the arbitrary and capricious test, but it is not basically an evidentiary test.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.982" offset="1959267">The arbitrary and capricious test is really directed at review of discretionary policy decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.634" offset="1985912">It is less stringent than the substantial evidence test.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.954" offset="2003153">Now, our position as to the proper application of judicial review in a -- is best illustrated by discussing a certificate convenience -- a certificate of convenience and necessity case, such as this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.981" offset="2059264">Judicial review would proceed as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.662" offset="2070026">The Court would first, to ask that whether the Commission has considered all relevant factors, and the factors relevant to a grant of a certificate of convenience and necessity are provided by statute by Section 307 of the Interstate Commerce Act which is set out at page 95 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.979" offset="2139303">Section 307 provides that the Commission shall issue a certificate if it finds, one, that the applicant is fit and able to perform the service and, two, that there's a present or future need for the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.195" offset="2188204">As I've indicated, the Commission made those findings in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.364" offset="2204818">The next question would be whether the Commission's findings as to those factors are supported by substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.671" offset="2234075">Now, the District Court did not apply the substantial evidence test in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.824" offset="2258631">Rather, it held that a mere review of the sufficiency of the evidence is not enough where agency findings are alleged to be arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.507" offset="2297396">It considered the arbitrary and capricious test, a more stringent test than the substantial evidence test, and it clearly viewed the test as permitting it to weigh the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.754" offset="2338356">Now, appellees say that the District Court did not weigh the evidence, that it simply reviewed the Commission's treatment of the evidence, but the District Court--</text>

            <text syncTime="788.261" offset="3256404">I believe that's correct, Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.815" offset="3274585">Now, there isn't any doubt that the District Court weighed the evidence in this case and you don't have to look any further than, again, page 1310 of the appendix, to look at Conclusion 12 where the District Court says the division acted arbitrarily in not giving weight to protestants' transit time studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.391" offset="3360893">Now, transit time studies are simply studies designed to show the time required to transport goods between two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.239" offset="3392345">14 protestants submitted transit time studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.696" offset="3406137">200 shippers submitted transit time studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.653" offset="3422020">All but two of the protestants transit time studies were done after the date of the notice in this case, and the Commission said, because they relate to service periods after the day of the notice, when the carriers knew there was going to be a determination about adequacy of service, they're not as prohibitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.185" offset="3492133">They don't present as valid a picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.038" offset="3503522">Now, many of the 200 shippers' transit time study suffered from the same defect, but if you look through the record, you'll find that 75 of those transit time studies related to periods before the date of the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.309" offset="3556603">But, in any event, this is the kind of evidentiary question that we think is for the Commission and the District Court should not have substituted its judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.377" offset="3592861">Nothing in Overton Park supports the District Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.212" offset="3608221">We think Overton Park makes clear that the substantial evidence test is a more stringent test than the arbitrary capricious test and that even out of the arbitrary and capricious test, standard review is quite narrow and that review in Court may not substitute its judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.230" offset="3676244">In effect, the District Court recognized that it could not weigh the evidence under the substantial evidence test, but it's held that it may avoid that limitation simply by invoking the arbitrary and capricious test.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.786" offset="3738520">And, we think its decision must be reversed for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.367" offset="3748864">Surely, Congress did not intend to prohibit and weigh the evidence under one provision of the Administrative Procedure Act and permitted under another.</text>

            <text syncTime="938.746" offset="3858369">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.160" offset="3867982">I would like, first, to address myself directly to the question raised by Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.150" offset="3895986">I have here the complaint that was filed by the appellees in the Court below, and when they come to the point of telling what was wrong, they speak of the Commission giving substantial evidence to -- the wrong evidence, they think, and they go to the next paragraph, substantial evidence, no weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.957" offset="3967248">Going down, substantial evidence on over, substantial evidence, substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.357" offset="3984802">Now, they started out, never once do they -- I mean, they say substantial weight, I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.605" offset="4013746">This is -- they say they gave substantial weight, substantial weight, substantial weight, never once mentioning substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.697" offset="4054183">So that, actually, their complaint doesn't state a valid legal reason to set aside the Commission's decision and so, I would certainly urge and I will come back to that in a moment that the proper action for this Court is to send it back with instruction to dismiss because they have raised no legal objection to the Interstate Commerce Commission's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.245" offset="4144358">Now, I come into this case representing shippers and in this particular form, I'm also representing the three carriers who were authorized to carry out the service which the Interstate Commerce Commission authorized and which court below took away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.887" offset="4218964">These shippers first came into this case after the hearing examiners had handed in their report and turned down all service to everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.045" offset="4271522">And, from the very outset, the shippers then who came in as parties to fight for the service then have focused on the monopoly, the competitive situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.117" offset="4311855">Now, this is, in brief, the way I see the motor carrier picture that they are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.342" offset="4340694">The southeastern carriers come down through North Carolina and South Carolina, all these burgeoning area of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.855" offset="4366817">They go over to Birmingham, to Memphis, and New Orleans and they have to unload there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.827" offset="4390640">And then, the southwestern carriers who come in from points, West, Dallas, Houston, they come in and pick up the packages and take them on to the southwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.592" offset="4441736">And, what these -- and this was kind of, I think it was kind of grandfathered-in in 1946 and of course the services have increased a lot since then, but the biggest thing that these shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.359" offset="4488756">And, there's never been a case where there were so many shippers came out to testify, 993 shippers testified orally in this case, out of 1,009 witnesses who testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.894" offset="4527000">So, you can see how enormously important it is to the shippers and they're coming in here as parties, I think, demonstrates that as much as anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.551" offset="4557615">And so, they wanted to breakthrough these gateways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.405" offset="4569004">That's their big argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.693" offset="4574124">They want single-lines service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.694" offset="4582170">There's very little breakthrough in those gateways now, but -- and most of these major carriers that come down to the southeast and go into Birmingham, Memphis, Atlanta, and New Orleans, they just stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.534" offset="4625533">They can't go on, and what these shippers wanted was a breakthrough and a breakdown of this whole monopoly situation and so, we asked the Commission to face up to this and we took exception to the examiners who said “well, we see monopolistic tendencies” but they didn't do anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.691" offset="4702124">And, we urge the Commission to do something about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.025" offset="4711424">So, what did the Commission do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.967" offset="4719261">The Commission spent about a year regrouping the evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.826" offset="4738696">It's set forth in Exhibit E to the -- it's an appendix to the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.278" offset="4760534">I'm sorry, it's 130-something pages, you need a microscope to read it, but it's because the evidence is so massive of the shippers but the hearing examiners had assembled this evidence according to commodities and kind of broke it up, someone said, atomized the whole thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.389" offset="4828975">And so, that didn't show the picture, but when the Commission itself regrouped the evidence according to points where the shippers were demanding more service, I was quite clear where their points were and what the service was, and it also helped the Commission in deciding which of the carriers could furnish that service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.184" offset="4900133">So, I said the shippers came in here pushing hard on monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.616" offset="4917791">Now, the Court below said this is politics, not judicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.029" offset="4931480">Well, I say it's policy and that the policy agency in this whole case is the Interstate Commerce Commission and not the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.079" offset="4967737">I think if there's anyone thing that epitomizes what the Court did below, it's what happened to the Walter-Logan Bill as compared to the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.447" offset="5001174">The President vetoed the Walter-Logan Bill because, above everything, it wiped out the expertise of administrative agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.842" offset="5038791">It had in there the clearly erroneous rule, and so the President vetoed it on the ground that all of the expertise, specialized knowledge and at least in the agency's case, the uniqueness was being wiped out and all the agencies would be, would be simply fact assemblers for the Courts and all the Courts would have to re-weigh the evidence under the clearly erroneous route, by picking and doing a bench trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.331" offset="5144743">And, that's what this Court did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.081" offset="5151744">It never mentioned or considered expertise of the Interstate Commerce Commission in focusing upon the competitive situation in allowing the breakthrough in these gateways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.277" offset="5200436">That's the big thing that the Interstate Commerce Commission did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.480" offset="5213288">Now, in the Court below, to me, there are major errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.127" offset="5227917">Not only was re-weighing the evidence, and I agree with Mr. Patton, that's what they did, but they treated this case as a battle between carriers forgetting that in every administrative agency hearing of this kind, the public interest is a party and the public interest is the biggest interest, and that's the interest to which the Interstate Commerce Commission responded here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.878" offset="5322898">They would've been derelict in their duty not to have responded to this tremendous out poring of shippers saying what is wrong with the service they have now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.416" offset="5361037">They pointed out that it took, sometimes, anywhere from 2 to 15 days to get their goods through these gateways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.995" offset="5383398">They wanted to break down the barriers and have single-line service between these great growing areas of the United States, the southeast and the southwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.559" offset="5421641">And so, when the Court treated this as a battle between carriers and focused only on the evidence that was favorable to the appellees, they didn't get a fair view of what the case is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.433" offset="5485066">They never once looked at the findings of the Interstate Commerce Commission as to need, and I submit that they're so overwhelming that no one can say that substantial evidence doesn't exist and that's why they talk about the weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.467" offset="5541282">That's why, in their complaint, they talk about the substantial weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.578" offset="5557687">They talked about substantial weight there and then, in the findings in opinion of the Court itself, they talk about weight in theory or evidence, superior evidence, all that kind of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.775" offset="5602513">And now, here, they talk about treatment of the evidence, but I sincerely urge upon this Court that unless you want to wipe out the expertise of administrative agencies, unless you want the Courts of this land to weigh the evidence of every administrative proceeding, this case must be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.047" offset="5687568">I'll give one illustration of the type of thing that you're faced with and looking what the court below did, the very first thing they talk about here is the Court said that the Commission didn't give proper weight to a summary of shipper evidence prepared by one of the parties, one of the -- it's not an appellee here, but one of the parties below, east Texas, made a summary of the shipper evidence which they said was favorable to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1621.258" offset="6588374">So, the peculiarity about this case is that they don't even mention the substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.126" offset="6615855">The Court doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.039" offset="6619512">The complaint doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.374" offset="6624841">And, I'd come back to the fact that since they didn't initially complain that substantial evidence doesn't exist, they admit that it does and the proper action for this Court is to send it back with instructions to dismiss the complaint because it's not a proper complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.321" offset="6684609">It doesn't raise a legal basis for a Court review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.496" offset="6701328">They asked the Court to weigh all the evidence and, over and over again, they talk about substantial weight, not giving substantial weight or giving substantial weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.727" offset="6730271">Now, that is not a proper legal appeal from an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.879" offset="6758902">Now, above all on this remand, let me say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.331" offset="6772694">From the view point of the shippers, this case has been underway since 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.658" offset="6797981">If this case is sent back to the Court or sent back to the Interstate Commerce Commission and you start that process all over again, that means that these shippers have to wait maybe 20 years because if there's any one thing that's demonstrated in this record, that is that people who don't want a particular service can stymie things within the administrative process of the administrative -- of the Interstate Commerce Commission for a long, long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.969" offset="6895261">And, we feel that this Court in its administrative capacity, looking at justice in this country, I would say there ought to be an end sometime and that the time has come when the public interest should be paramount rather than the interest of these people who are disturbed simply because they didn't get -- they were not chosen to render the new service or because it might interfere a little bit competitively with them, and we say to you that these people, four times, argued all of their points before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.157" offset="7020022">Their biggest point, I suppose, is that there'd been a lot of changes in service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.703" offset="7034232">It's increased during the pendency of this case, but the Commission considered all of that, specifically in Exhibit G it listed the -- increases in footnotes and in their summary of the pleadings, it listed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.193" offset="7088149">So, the Commission considered all of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.167" offset="7096090">And -- so then, when you come to their claim that you don't need it because of these mini services that have come along since then, well, the Commission said it considered all of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.670" offset="7142066">They talk about taking business away from existing carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.936" offset="7159097">That's bad diversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.467" offset="7169233">Well, the Commission considered that and rejected it, and it ought to know what it's talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.132" offset="7187937">It said that demand for this service is so great that a little bit of diversion is not going to matter and that these people would do their job and furnish the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.818" offset="7222627">They're not going to lose out in competition with other carriers and after all, competition is a light blood of this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.964" offset="7255228">So, I don't apologize for having raised the issue of monopoly and competition before the Interstate Commerce Commission and fought it on through to this Court because this Court has in a number of cases, said that antitrust competitive monopoly principles do apply in motor carrier cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.807" offset="7318549">And so, I would urge upon this Court that you not simply reverse, but that you reverse with instructions to dismiss because there's got to be an end to litigation sometime, and 10 years is enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.603" offset="7401827">To make these people wait even another year is too much after waiting 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.178" offset="7424084">There has never been so many shippers come out to demand service in the history of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.183" offset="7448116">I again say they would've been derelict in their duty if they hadn't found that the paramount public interest, not the interest of these various carriers who were fighting among themselves but the paramount public interest, demands this service and that this Court should, really in the public interest, order that that service be put into effect as quickly as possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="2636.537" offset="10649475">I use that as an illustration because the Commission did in fact consider only that portion of the witness' testimony, for example, that it come out on direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.278" offset="10700466">Everything that came out on cross, although that was recorded in the examiner's findings to which no exception was taken, no weight was given to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.129" offset="10747904">It was disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.465" offset="10753233">That portion of the evidence was disregarded but, more significantly, the rebuttal evidence, all of the evidence in opposition was, in effect, thrown out of the window by this statement that “we will not give -- consider this evidence as entitled to any weight for these reasons.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.377" offset="10836929">Now, what the Court said was “those reasons are not valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.798" offset="10858559">We are not ourselves weighing the evidence, but we are saying that the Commission did not weigh the evidence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.671" offset="10894085">The Commission looked at only one side of the case and when it came to the other side of the case, it said “we won't give consideration to it for these reasons,” and they're no reasons at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.150" offset="10943927">They are not justifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.751" offset="10950405">The Court said this is an arbitrary, capricious, it lacks a rational basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.637" offset="10977886">That is why we couched our complaint more in terms of the first subparagraph of Section 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act rather than in subparagraph (d) relating to substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.897" offset="11042983">It's because that paragraph uniquely describes the type of error that was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.147" offset="11076002">The lower court said this, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.562" offset="11089586">The lower court said that the Commission did not apply the basic rudiments of fairness, that the Commission's report indicates a predilection to grant these particular applications followed by a strained attempt to marshal facts to support such findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.333" offset="11180701">The strain was too much for the Court to bear, and it said, viewed in its entirety, the report sounds more in advocacy than an impartial adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.345" offset="11232737">But, if I may venture to say so, it just isn't good advocacy, may it please the Court, to say we will not give consideration to this evidence because it relates to specific shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.480" offset="11285295">None of the advocates would make such a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.098" offset="11299715">The Commission did that of its own motion and if that is grounds to disregard or not give weight to testimony, that ground automatically applies to every shipper that testified in the case, because he testified only about his particular traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.191" offset="11384142">Now, if that is an invalid reason for considering his evidence, it applies to all of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.204" offset="11416221">The Court said that the Commission applied a prejudicial and discriminatory double standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.218" offset="11452270">It applied one standard to evidence presented by certain parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.811" offset="11470660">When it came to other parties, it applied a different standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.960" offset="11487169">Let me illustrate one of those instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.286" offset="11500544">In the early part of its report, the Commission was dealing with certain exhibits showing what a particular applicant had been doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.133" offset="11539937">He says “you can test what I propose to do by what I am now doing,” and presented statistical data showing that, for example, during a one-week test period in early 1966 this particular applicant was operating from Richmond to Memphis an average of two-and-a half days in transit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.410" offset="11633037">Well, we came in and said “what does two-and-a half day in transit really mean?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.171" offset="11652054">It's almost a meaningless figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.346" offset="11660727">So, we took those identical statistics, their figures, and we analyzed them in accordance with their proposal and we said “look here.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.854" offset="11702836">What does it mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.078" offset="11707643">It means that they are performing their service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.247" offset="11720391">They are getting the freight on time 55% of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.225" offset="11740244">Whereas, all of the witnesses who testified had said “that's not the type of service we want.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.846" offset="11758738">Yet, that is the type of service that the applicant was performing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.492" offset="11773367">That is the type of service the applicant says “you can test what I propose to do by what I am now doing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.747" offset="11802311">Now, on page 116 of the report, the Commission made a finding of fact that the applicant can do this because it's -- now operating two-and-a half days from Richmond to Memphis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.987" offset="11863333">Over in a subsequent part of the report, dealing with our contention that the applicant's own exhibits showed that they were not performing and could not perform in the manner in which they had represented to the witnesses they would perform, what did the Commission do there?</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.857" offset="11930833">The Commission says proof of past performance cannot be used to test what an applicant proposes to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.129" offset="11963852">They took the same exhibit, the same sheet of paper and in the early part of its report we make certain findings based upon this exhibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.067" offset="12003662">Later on, without apparently realizing they were talking about the same sheet of paper, they said this type of evidence is entitled to no prohibitive value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.791" offset="12042533">That is exactly what is in this report and the Court says that that shows a predilection to grant these particular applications followed by a strained attempt to marshal facts to support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.830" offset="12110660">Now, in the court below, this applicant was still urging “test what we propose to do by what we showed we have been doing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.526" offset="12145455">The Commission had said “we won't look at that test except insofar as it's favorable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.062" offset="12167607">As to its unfavorable, we will not look at it.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3071.458" offset="12389230">And, the Court said “we have considered all of the proposed findings.</text>

            <text syncTime="3225.735" offset="13006346">On certain lines between certain points, that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.067" offset="13023692">Between other points, there was one-line service all the way through, but the shippers would say “we would like to have another one-line, single-line service is the proper term, from A to B.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.575" offset="13081684">There is not enough service from that standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.854" offset="13098820">First, it must be borne in mind there isn't a single point proposed to be served that did not have multiple service at the time of the applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.017" offset="13147408">Also, it must be borne in mind that they proposed on a very highly limited selective type of service to go through the small communities and serve only the major communities and leave to the existing carriers the obligation to handle the less profitable freight to the smaller communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.083" offset="13235702">The examiners found that the approval of any 1 of these 10 applications would result in a deterioration of service primarily to the smaller communities, but also to the larger communities, that the public interest would be damaged by the approval of any one of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.723" offset="13334235">The facts upon which those findings were -- conclusions were based were adopted verbatim by the division, but they reached a different conclusion from those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.119" offset="13387839">I think it might be also helpful to note that this was not a general influx of citizens asking for service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.589" offset="13421693">This was not a general investigation by the Commission, which they could have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.255" offset="13440397">These are individual applicants that had sought a particular service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.639" offset="13457951">They were consolidated for hearing and we had here the most unusual situation of having ten major applications heard on one record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.282" offset="13496508">One of the things it resulted in, each time an applicant would call a witness to the stand he would be criticizing other applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.086" offset="13523675">So, we saw that there was no difference really between the applicants and the protestants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.050" offset="13547604">Also, it should be noted that these shippers were not parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.627" offset="13565889">They were witnesses, 41 of them were permitted to intervene as parties represented by Mr. Rhyne after the initial decision had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.745" offset="13622314">It was only then that any suggestion had been made of any antitrust issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.566" offset="13645615">Up to then, the consideration by the examiners was just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.377" offset="13660871">There is so much service that it is really destructive competition at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.660" offset="13686053">Also, mention has been made of the fact that the affirmance of this case would result in denying service to a large number of shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.422" offset="13741014">With deference, may it please the Court, I submit that just the contrary would be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.114" offset="13771839">In the first place, the most unusual aspect of this case is that while it was pending in the Commission, there was a massive increase in single-line service that took place with Commission approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.984" offset="13839339">Bearing in mind that the whole theory of the case was not that there is not sufficient service, but there is not sufficient single-line service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.099" offset="13875806">The Commission found, and all of the witnesses, all of the parties acknowledged, that there is a direct correlation between the number of times a shipment changes hands and the expeditiousness of the shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.445" offset="13929200">So, single-line service per se is of utmost importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.403" offset="13948949">The entire theory of the case was predicated upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.172" offset="13964100">So, what took place was that, while these cases were pending before the Commission, there were a series of mergers, consolidations with Commission approval, and a few new grants of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.896" offset="14014986">The examiners took note of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.346" offset="14024808">For example, they pointed out that at the time of the hearing between the focal points of the application, Atlanta and Dallas, there were three single-line carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.449" offset="14069217">But, at the time of their decision in 1969, there were seven such carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.682" offset="14094085">The examiners said, given effect to the present service available, bearing in mind the statutory criteria to determine the present and future public convenience and necessity, we find that there is a multiplicity of service available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.404" offset="14169004">When it went before the -- a division composed of 3 of the 11 Commissioners, we petition to reopen to present proof of the changed conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.163" offset="14216025">The Commission says “no, that will not be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.631" offset="14229922">Under our decision, citing primarily the West Brothers case, we will give effect to this increase in service.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.148" offset="14263986">Now, incidentally, the West Brothers case is particularly unique because it involved two of the points involved and the carriers involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.449" offset="14293138">Briefly stated, the Commission had granted West authority to operate from Alabama to Louisiana which included authority to operate from Birmingham to Baton Rouge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.479" offset="14337337">After that grant had been approved, certain protestants petitioned the Commission for reconsideration, as we did in this case, pointing out that in another case, while it was -- the West Brothers case was pending and the Mercury case, the Commission had granted Mercury authority to operate between Birmingham and Baton Rouge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.814" offset="14418631">The Commission says “that's right”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.487" offset="14425318">We must give effect to our grants and other proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.542" offset="14445589">We re-opened the West Brothers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.123" offset="14455829">We modified that so as to eliminate from the grant to West Brothers to authority to operate between Birmingham and Baton Rouge we've given Mercury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.053" offset="14491564">Now, Mercury wasn't even a party to the West Brothers case, but they properly gave effect to their other decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.971" offset="14515284">In other words, letting the right hand know what the left hand was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.846" offset="14530748">In our case, they cited West Brothers as authority for the proposition “we must give effect,” but what did they do?</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.048" offset="14563558">They granted two more carriers, Red Ball and Bowman authority from Birmingham to Baton Rouge that they had just said in West “we can't do,” and three more from Atlanta to Baton Rouge, all three of these applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.899" offset="14618937">So, at the time of the Commission decision, they went back and looked at an exhibit that had been introduced by Johnson at the outset of the hearing summarizing all of the available single-line service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.463" offset="14673272">And, they said “based on that exhibit, we conclude there is a paucity of single-line service available and, in that respect, we take note of the fact that in 1970 census, compared to 1960 census, there has been an increase in population.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.752" offset="14742340">So they judged, and the only comprehensive analysis they made of the quantity of service available was based upon the condition in early 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.244" offset="14788315">They concluded there is a paucity of single-line service available, ignoring the examiner's conclusion that, given effect to the changes, there is now a multiplicity of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.947" offset="14839202">But, what had taken place?</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.145" offset="14847979">Two more years had transpired between the examiner's decision and the division decision and, by then the 7 between Atlanta and Dallas had grown to 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.685" offset="14898134">At the time of the hearing, there was one single-line carrier between Baton Rouge and Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.115" offset="14927809">At the time of the division's decision, there were 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.947" offset="14947140">So, the witnesses had been saying “we would like to have another carrier available.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.885" offset="14966888">Without exception, they all had multiple other carriers available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.433" offset="14985070">The Commission, in certain respects, said this case is moot as to certain aspects of it that are not important here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.370" offset="15016835">We submit, they could just as well have said the entire case is moot because the issue is the -- a contention there is a need for addition of single-line service and there has been a massive influx of single-line service occurred while these cases are pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.998" offset="15095411">Instead of doing that, saying “we must give effect to these recent grants,” they did not give effect to the recent grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.273" offset="15132505">Instead, they continued on, what the Court termed, “a prejudicial and discriminatory double standard.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.874" offset="15166882">I would like to illustrate that a little bit further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.845" offset="15178794">I have mentioned these transit term studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.857" offset="15190810">They were the most important part of our evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.687" offset="15202095">That's true, but they did other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.431" offset="15213066">What about the transit time studies that the shippers themselves introduced?</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.369" offset="15232815">They were fragmentary, individual shippers showing different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.297" offset="15252564">So, after the applicants had all rested, there was a several-month recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.312" offset="15272626">We took every single transit time study presented by every witness and made it into a composite analysis where you could look at it together and not fragmentary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.293" offset="15324557">What did it show?</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.767" offset="15330408">It showed that the protestant service reflected by those exhibits between the points that we studied was superior to the applicant service but more significantly, that, overall, the service was reasonably satisfactory even bearing in mind that the shippers had set about to, in most instances, to give the horrible examples of poor service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.343" offset="15420792">The Commission would not give effect to our analysis, the composite analysis, but looked on it to the fragmentary exhibits as they were introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.344" offset="15464782">The Commission said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3844.262" offset="15480456">Certain protestants have restrictions in their tariffs and engage in certain restrictive practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.641" offset="15513893">Well, in the first place, we don't think that's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3854.721" offset="15522252">The Commission has plenary power to require a carrier to do away with any restrictive practice or eliminate from its tariff any restrictive provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.498" offset="15557360">We heard argument to that effect this morning in connection with a different section of the Act, but what did they do?</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.408" offset="15585050">They said “one of the reasons we want to grant this is because the protestants have restrictions,” ignoring the fact that the applicants had the identical restrictions and, while the case was pending, published additional ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="3977.860" offset="16014817">We pointed that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.586" offset="16014712">They paid no attention whatever to that, but just hung their findings on the fact that the protestants had certain restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.130" offset="16014608">They went out of the record and out of their way, if it may please the Court, to take official notice of an industry publication that said that one of the protestants had closed one terminal, subsequent to the hearing, in one town in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.791" offset="16014503">We had been arguing that the applicant's proposals were not realistic because, among other things, there was Bowman proposing to establish a whole series of new terminals, whereas, it served vast areas in the East where it had no terminals at all, over 100 cities of comparable size where it had no terminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.263" offset="16014399">We were pressing that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.393" offset="16014294">They ignored that argument but went outside of the record to take official notice of the fact that one protestant had closed a terminal in one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.359" offset="16014190">When they did that, we petitioned them but, look here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.325" offset="16014085">The same publication will show that Red Ball, one of the applicants, has closed 35 of its terminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.198" offset="16013981">Yet, the Commission said “one of the reasons we are going to grant authority to Red Ball is because it has 92 terminals.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.373" offset="16013876">That fact was not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.667" offset="16013772">It was correct at the time of the hearing, but it was not correct at the time, it appeared in the Commission's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.999" offset="16019414">They have closed 35 of their terminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.159" offset="16032057">The appellants still cite that in their reply brief to this Court, filed a few days ago, justifying the Commission's grant, the finding that there were 92 terminals pointing out that, really, the closing of the terminal of Red Balls was not reflected in the same edition of that American Motor Carrier directory but in another edition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.713" offset="16118262">They could have pointed it out to the Commission if they had seen it fit to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.313" offset="16132577">This is a changed condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.720" offset="16138219">We bring it to your attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4011.047" offset="16147519">Again, one standard was applied to the applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.633" offset="16161938">A different standard was applied to the protestants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.974" offset="16175313">In every instance where there was a criticism, as pointed out by the examiners, those criticisms applied to the applicants as well as to the protestants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4028.309" offset="16216586">They did not give effect to any of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="4031.120" offset="16227871">So, we filed a petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4033.379" offset="16236857">It was overruled by a 2:1 vote of the Commission without an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.465" offset="16257233">We asked for the entire Commission to review it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.918" offset="16267055">Again, without an opinion, it was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.805" offset="16278549">So, it went to Court on the basis of two of the Commissioners finally voting to grant and we submit on the conditions that violated the basic rules of fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4056.363" offset="16328808">Now, we submit, may it please the Court, that the proper standard of review is found in examining Section 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.826" offset="16382725">It's not necessary to decide whether the arbitrary and capricious standard is more strict as alleged than a substantial evidence test.</text>
            <text syncTime="4079.430" offset="16421073">Some text writers will say just the opposite, but it's not involved in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.387" offset="16440926">It's not necessary for this Court to make that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4088.203" offset="16456182">It's also not necessary for any Court to compartmentalize its findings that this is a subsection (a) decision or a subsection (b) decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4101.209" offset="16508217">I make reference to the Acheson case in which there was a recital by the lower Court and by one of the opinions, there was no majority opinion here, that there was substantial evidence but the Court went on to set it aside, affirming the setting aside by the lower Court, not for lack of substantial evidence or not for any of the other grounds and without specifying exactly what it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4127.075" offset="16611662">But, obviously, it was because it was arbitrary, capricious, and abuse of discretion or not otherwise in accordance with law. The applicants state, time and again, “look at this evidence, by themselves, these facts provide a substantial evidence for the Commission's findings of inadequate service.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4147.372" offset="16692851">But, as stated in Universal Camera by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, the Administrative Procedure Act put that to rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.300" offset="16720541">You cannot look at evidence by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.511" offset="16733393">You must look at the entire evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.187" offset="16744155">The Court quoted from Professor Jeffrey an excellent statement on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.323" offset="16768711">To abstract out of a case, that part of the evidence which can be made to support a conclusion is to imagine an abstract case, a case that was never tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="4176.256" offset="16808417">A conclusion based on such abstracted evidence may be “rational,” but it is not a rational decision of the case which was in fact tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.921" offset="16851048">Evidence which may be logically substantial in isolation may lose its logical relevance, even its claim to credibility in context with other evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4197.517" offset="16893471">We say that the division, the three-man division, should have given effect to the entire evidence instead of saying “we will not give effect to this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.320" offset="16948642">We will give effect to the identical evidence if it helps the applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.089" offset="16967764">We won't give effect to it if it's detrimental to the applicants.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4220.107" offset="16983751">And, assigning a reason, that is to say like the evidence relates to specific shippers, which was equally applicable to all of the evidence that they did give effect to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.875" offset="17030875">All in the world, the Court here was talking about is fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4238.420" offset="17057102">The division did not treat these parties with fairness and, as a result, the public -- it would be damaged under this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.542" offset="17109556">Instead of saying “we are going to grant three more carriers from Atlanta to Dallas,” as I really believe the division thought that they were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4260.416" offset="17145083">What they would be doing was increasing to 16 to 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="4265.058" offset="17163577">Instead of putting an additional carrier to an operation from Atlanta to Baton Rouge, they would increase to 7 to 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="4274.362" offset="17200776">Nowhere in there did they recognize what the present service was, although they said “we must give effect to it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4282.447" offset="17233168">Now, the lower Court entered an order setting aside, holding invalid, and enjoining the implementation of the Commission's order in the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.043" offset="17275591">That's as far as the lower Court went.</text>
            <text syncTime="4295.629" offset="17285935">The government, but not the private parties, then filed a motion saying “that order is beyond your power, your jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4304.814" offset="17322611">You must supplement it or amend it to provide for remand.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4309.253" offset="17340374">The Court says “no, remand isn't, by statute or case law, obligatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4315.117" offset="17363884">It's discretionary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4316.513" offset="17369422">No one has ever suggested a remand would serve a useful purpose and, here, I believe it's been admitted that remand will not serve a useful purpose to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4326.990" offset="17411323">This record is old.</text>
            <text syncTime="4329.167" offset="17419995">The Court didn't set it aside because it was old, but if it went back to the Commission with instructions to give effect to this record, this record deals with that Baton Rouge shipper talking about “I need a second single-line carrier,” whereas, in fact, today, there are seven.</text>
            <text syncTime="4345.062" offset="17483630">It deals with apples.</text>
            <text syncTime="4346.967" offset="17491257">The issue is oranges.</text>
            <text syncTime="4349.055" offset="17499617">There's no need in the world to use that and, as the Court said, it would impede rather than facilitate further proceedings that the Commission is free at any time to conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4359.929" offset="17543084">We do not go into the field of ultimate decision of the issue of public convenience and necessity.</text>

            <text syncTime="4464.390" offset="17960939">That decision had nothing to do with the age of the record, as I read the Court's opinion, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="4468.885" offset="17978911">It reached its decision without any reference at all to the age of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4473.754" offset="17998346">It considered the age of the record only as to what -- where shall we go from here.</text>

            <text syncTime="4490.889" offset="18066892">The reason it assigned is because the order was arbitrary and capricious, not because of the age of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4499.400" offset="18100955">The age of the record question came up after that order was entered, and we permanently enjoined enforcement of this particular order, that is, implementing the order that was before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4511.013" offset="18147453">Then, it addressed itself to the question, shall we amend that order and make it obligatory that the Commission have further proceedings on the present record or shall we just leave it up to the Commission as to what they are going to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="4524.358" offset="18200848">And, it said that “we think that the Commission would be better off starting over, citing the cases that it cited there, which the Commission has been free to do at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4534.178" offset="18240136">But, no one has yet suggested that it would be helpful in the further proceedings to test the issue of present and future public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4543.672" offset="18278066">Obviously, the present situation must be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4546.505" offset="18289351">No one has suggested that, in making that determination, use of the old record would facilitate the determination of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4556.224" offset="18328221">We submit that basically, here, the Court has cited in the J-T Transport case that it was cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="4565.289" offset="18364479">We must give deference to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4568.064" offset="18375659">The issue of public convenience and necessity is for the Commission, but we do not have to accept the Commission's determination where we are convinced, as here, the Commission has loaded one of the scales.</text>
            <text syncTime="4581.376" offset="18428844">That statement fully applies to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4584.712" offset="18442219">Also, the statements in Burlington Truck Lines, cited by the Court, that expert discretion is the life and blood of the administrative process, but unless we will make the requirements for administrative action strict and demanding expertise, the strength of modern government can become a monster which rules with no practical limits on its discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="4615.258" offset="18564368">Thank you, Mr. Justice Douglas, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4620.475" offset="18585266">Frankly, in view of the concession by counsel that the findings of fact of the Interstate Commerce Commission were not in issue here or in the Court below or in the complaint, I really see no useful purpose that I could perform by re-arguing the evidence to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4651.758" offset="18710444">So, everything that my distinguished adversary has said, he argued over and over again to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4659.736" offset="18742314">Everything has been updated several times.</text>
            <text syncTime="4662.768" offset="18754435">So, unless some member of the Court has questions that they would like me to answer, I don't see -- I say, what useful purpose I could perform by talking about findings that are not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4677.469" offset="18813262">That's -- the whole case, as far as I'm concerned, is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="4681.837" offset="18830712">And, I would simply urge that, under the circumstances, the Court send it back to the District Court with instructions to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="4689.104" offset="18859760">I don't see how there's any other alternative.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="4691.534" offset="18869478">Mr. Rhyne, how about, for example, the Commission, one of its order was partly based on the fact that Red Ball had 94 terminals and now we're told that it's closed 35 of those of the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4709.496" offset="18941367">Any mentions of that, you don't mention it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4710.822" offset="18946696">In fact, you're talking about 94 in your reply brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="4712.452" offset="18953174">Well, in our reply brief we point out that the Commission, at the time of its decision based its official notice on one document that was a 1971 document and what they're talking about on the closing is a 1972 document but, Mr. Justice Stewart, what they're really talking about is agency discontinuances and consolidations done by Red Ball.</text>
            <text syncTime="4741.083" offset="19067695">That isn't a major thing in this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4744.218" offset="19080234">And so --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="4745.451" offset="19085145">And if they went out of their way to, as I understand it, to point out that one of the protestants had closed a single terminal, one terminal?</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_s_rhyne" startTime="4753.147" stopTime="4797.213">

            <text syncTime="4753.147" offset="19115969">Well, again, they did that, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.610" offset="19133837">But, they were talking about-- they took official notice of this and they took official notice of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.625" offset="19153899">So, they took official notice of the facts as they were as of the time of their decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4766.916" offset="19171035">I really don't think that is a major part of their decision because, as I said before, the Commission regrouped the testimony of the witnesses, these 933 witnesses, according to geographic points which made the service stand out that was needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4785.178" offset="19244074">That was a big issue here and, after that was done, they take a look at the points that needed service and that's how they selected the three carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4794.031" offset="19279496">They just fitted into that picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="4795.722" offset="19286288">They could best serve those points.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="4797.213" offset="19292244">Well, at the time of the hearing I think there was one direct line from Atlanta to Baton Rouge and the Commission's order was based on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4806.600" offset="19329755">And now, it turns out, there's seven, aren't there?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles S. Rhyne</label>
            <text syncTime="4808.924" offset="19339055">Your Honor, the Commission's order is not based on one line.</text>
            <text syncTime="4813.841" offset="19358699">If Your Honor will look at Exhibit G, every increase in service is listed there and if Your Honor will look at Exhibit D, every increase in service is mentioned there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4827.107" offset="19411780">And, the Commission said “sure, all of these arguments about increased service were argued all the way through,” and they say “in spite of all of this, we find that the public interest requires this new service.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4839.656" offset="19462040">And so, I think that since the Commission, the great expert in this whole area has held that additional service and particularly breakthrough service through the gateway, sure, there was one or two before this started that went through the gateway and there was probably one or two more that had increased, but getting through those gateways was an enormous breakthrough for the shippers that are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4863.311" offset="19556603">So, I say, I don't really want to re-argue my evidence but I think, Mr. Justice Stewart, that every point that was raised here the Commission considered and it was the one to consider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.097" offset="19603728">It did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.839" offset="19606758">They don't challenge their findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.046" offset="19615535">I really don't know what else I could say.</text>
            <text syncTime="4880.518" offset="19625462">So, thank you very much.</text>
