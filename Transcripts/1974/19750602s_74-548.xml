            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">I also have for announcement, No. 74-548, the United States v. State Tax Commission of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.496" offset="41900">Regulation 25 of the Mississippi State Tax Commission requires out-of-state liquor distillers and suppliers to collect from military installations within Mississippi, there are four of such installations in Mississippi, and remit to the Commission, a tax in the form of a wholesale markup of 17% to 20% on liquor sold to the military at those installations.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.240" offset="160914">A three-judge District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi held that the legal incidence of the tax is upon the out-state-liquor dealers and suppliers and therefore rejected the argument of the United States that the tax is unconstitutional under the doctrine of McCulloch and Maryland as a state upon instrumentalities of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.808" offset="255164">We reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.375" offset="261433">We hold that since Mississippi law requires that the out-of-state sellers collect the tax from the military, the legal incidence of the tax as a matter of law is upon the military and therefore that the tax is an unconstitutional state levy upon instrumentalities of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.176" offset="344607">Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Rehnquist dissents and have filed a dissenting statement.</text>
