            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">I have for announcement, No. 74-466, Dunlop v. Bachowski here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.197" offset="52767">The Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, requires that any complaint, the violations of that Act occurred in the conduct of a union election must be filed with the Secretary of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.430" offset="121626">The Act provides further that the Secretary must investigate the complaint and if he decides that violations affecting the result of the election had occurred must bring a civil action to set aside the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.436" offset="185678">In this case, a complaint was filed with the Secretary that irregularities had occurred in an election conducted by the United Steelworkers of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.307" offset="225176">The Secretaries investigation led him to conclude that although there were irregularities they have not affected the outcome of the election and he therefore refused to bring a suit to set aside the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.337" offset="289332">The loser in the election then brought this suit, seeking a court order compelling the Secretary to bring the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.171" offset="324650">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that the Secretary's decision was subject to judicial review and that such review extended to a trial type inquiry into the factual basis of the Secretary's conclusion that no violations occurred that affected the outcome of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.431" offset="405629">We disagree and reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.374" offset="417437">We agree that the decision not to file suit is not immune from judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.585" offset="442305">We hold, however, that that review was limited to the determination whether a statement of reasons informing the Court and the complaining union member of the grounds of the Secretary's decision and the essential facts upon which it is based shows within the four corners of the statement itself that the Secretary's decision was rationally based or shows rather that the decision was arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.337" offset="553273">Mr. Justice Rehnquist dissents and has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
