            <text syncTime="77.746" offset="414386">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.947" offset="427133">The issue in this case concerns the proper treatment under the immigration laws of that class of aliens known as green card commuters.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.965" offset="463182">A commuter is an alien who has been legally admitted to the United States as an immigrant with the attendant privilege of residing permanently in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.530" offset="501530">He has chosen, however, not to exercise that privilege, at least for the time being.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.815" offset="522637">Instead, he maintains his residence in Mexico or Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.420" offset="537057">He commutes to work in this country, entering each time on the basis of what used to be a green colored border crossers' identification card, which like the bluebook that some of us know of has changed colors but not names.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.371" offset="588884">It's now blue card, it looks very much like a driver's license, but it's still called the green card.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.004" offset="607378">This is the immigrant's alien registration receipt card which is issued to every immigrant shortly after he enters this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.481" offset="645308">There are two general classes of commuters, although the lines are not always easy to draw.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.385" offset="668923">First, some immigrants commute on a daily basis to jobs in this country, returning each night to their home, much in the same way that a Maryland of Virginia resident would commute to the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.948" offset="719182">Second, some commute on a seasonal basis coming to this country for longer stretches of time, usually to work in agricultural labor and then returning to their homes across the border usually at the end of the planting or growing season.</text>

            <text syncTime="213.345" offset="956792">That's right, mostly, it's -- the majority, I believe, are in the Windsor-Detroit area, but there are spread out over the Northwest and Northeast as well, some daily commuters.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.119" offset="995871">Of the 42,000 Mexican daily commuters, about 15,000 or little less than one-third are employed as farm laborers, the rest are engaged in industrial labor or building a construction work or in sales and service work.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.031" offset="1055535">Of the 8,000 Canadians, less than 200 are agricultural workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.338" offset="1072776">Most, as I've indicated, commute from the Windsor, Ontario area to the Detroit, Michigan area.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.189" offset="1100152">In addition to these 50,000 daily commuters, there are about 9,000 seasonal workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.784" offset="1118542">All of them currently are from Mexico, most of them involved in agricultural work.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.752" offset="1146337">The legal issue here is whether these daily and seasonal commuters, each of whom has been previously admitted to this country lawfully as an immigrant, may cross the border to work each day or each season without applying each time for a new immigrant visa, which is the formal document ordinarily required for entry to this country as an immigrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.159" offset="1228048">If a new visa were required for each entry, the commuter practice could not continue, even if it were physically possible to process 50,000 applications for visas -- for visas per day.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.006" offset="1279352">The entire annual limitation upon the issuance of immigrant visas to western hemisphere immigrants since 1968 is 120,000 which, of course, would be exhausted in less than three days.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.488" offset="1333373">The immigration authorities have followed the practice for 47 years of permitting commuters to enter as immigrants with informal border crossing documents after their initial entry with an immigrant visa.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.943" offset="1395127">The lawfulness of that practice under the present Act is determined by Section 211 of the Act, which is set forth at page 80 of our brief and I -- it maybe worth referring to it because the language -- the case would -- turns on the precise language of these sections.</text>

            <text syncTime="364.729" offset="1562311">So, in Section [Voice Overlap] [Attempt to Laughter] Section 211 (a) establishes the general rule that an immigrant visa is required for entry as an immigrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.935" offset="1607137">211 (b) establishes the sole exception to that requirement, which permits the Attorney General to dispense with formal documents for “returning resident immigrants” defined in Section 101 (a) 27 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="390.300" offset="1664606">It is therefore the language of that Section 101 (a) 27 (b) upon which this case in our view turns.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.527" offset="1693445">That language appears just above Section 211 at the top of page 80.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.647" offset="1713925">It is one of the definitions as you can see of special immigrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.619" offset="1729808">When it is read together with Section 211 (b), it provides that a visa is not required for entry by “an immigrant lawfully admitted for permanent residence who is returning from a temporary visit abroad.”</text>

            <text syncTime="572.870" offset="2394885">Well, that's what it would seem.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.838" offset="2398751">But when you analyze it, you've got three words, temporary, visit and abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.743" offset="2418395">Now temporary clearly applies in all -- in both commuters -- a commuter whether he is residing here in Mexico or in Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.270" offset="2444413">Abroad is also without question.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.281" offset="2452459">The only word that really carries this superficial implication is visit, and in the context of a commuter who is not a resident here, there's nothing that really strains the language to say that he's visiting when he goes home to sleep or goes home for part of the season.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.715" offset="2526229">What's implied in the word visit, I think, is the intention to come back to this country, that it's a departure for temporary purposes with an intention to return.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.008" offset="2567398">And I think that that -- while it's -- as the Ninth Circuit said, there's some strain in the language, I don't think it's so severe that we should read the rest of the statute as having been attended to, to abolish this practice we're going after so long.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.236" offset="2628315">Let me add also that there is -- I mean, this all seems a little strange, I confess, but the legislative history that underlies the Act itself makes it quite plain that Congress was fully aware that the Service was treating, had a class of commuters that were treated as lawfully admitted permanent residents, although they were residing in foreign contiguous territory and on pages 52-54 of our brief, we've set forth the crucial language in the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.741" offset="2762376">The report that I'm referring to is one that was a product of an exhaustive study by the Senate Judiciary Committee that was the basis upon which the 1952 Act was developed and ultimately enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.489" offset="2825279">This was a 900-page report in which the entire field of Immigration and Nationality law and practice was thoroughly examined.</text>

            <text syncTime="804.835" offset="3322755">Well, the original language of 211 (b) was enacted in 1952, but it has been amended and the plaintiffs in 1965 and the plaintiffs -- I refer to Mr. Terris' clients -- plaintiffs because we're cross-petitioners here.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.483" offset="3389315">The plaintiffs attach some significance to the change.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.071" offset="3403630">Originally, the language read, I'm looking now at 211 (b) where the language appears, “returning resident immigrants defined in Section 101 (a) 27 (b).”</text>
            <text syncTime="835.521" offset="3445426">Originally the language read, “aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who depart from the United States temporarily” and the plaintiffs have argued that the changes from that language to the present language reflected Congress' determination that actual residence was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.885" offset="3514911">In fact, no such purpose can be found anywhere in the legislative history of this amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.890" offset="3550960">The plaintiffs argue that a brief exchange, obscure colloquy is what the Ninth Circuit referred to it as, between the general counsel of the Immigration Service and a staff member of the House Judiciary Committee, in which the staff member was asking certain questions about the commuter practice and was getting responses from the general counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.772" offset="3646464">They draw from this the inference that two years later in a Bill, it wasn't even before Congress at the time the hearings in which this exchange took place, were commenced, was intended to be a response to the Service's, practice with respect to commuters.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.412" offset="3713024">Well, it's very hard to accept that when you look at the reports that are associated with this 1965 Amendment which was a very major piece of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.223" offset="3760253">Nowhere in the report is there any mention of commuters, the reports of the House and the Senate each list 9 or 12 what they call basic changes that are going to be made in the Immigration Act by this amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.462" offset="3809259">No mention is made there of commuters.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.481" offset="3817305">The House or Senate Report of (Inaudible) Rich says that the rest are minor and technical and it's difficult for me to comprehend that the relevant committees of the House and Senate would with the stroke of a pen abolish a commuter practice that's been going on for 47 years, at that time not quite that long, but for quite a long time, without mentioning that it was doing it or without specifying that it had any intention to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.101" offset="3911764">And I can't believe that it would be viewed as a minor or technical change.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.326" offset="3956694">There's a contention made here also that the commuters failed to satisfy the definition because they are not immigrants, but rather non-immigrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.048" offset="4035584">An immigrant is defined by the Act as any alien who is not a non-immigrant and it is in that sense a negative definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.071" offset="4067662">If you're not a non-immigrant, you're automatically an immigrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.626" offset="4081873">The non-immigrants are defined in -- for purposes irrelevant to this case in Section 101 (a) 15 (H) (ii) which is set forth on page 79 of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.732" offset="4138297">And that states that you are a non-immigrant, if you're an alien having a residence in a foreign country which -- who has no intention of abandoning it, who is coming temporarily to the United States to perform temporary services or labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.646" offset="4193991">Plaintiffs contend that this fits precisely what -- to the situation with respect to commuters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.946" offset="4215202">What they neglect, what they overlook, however, is that there is an additional requirement associated with that category of non-immigrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.968" offset="4243205">Namely, if unemployed persons capable of performing such a service or labor cannot be found in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.127" offset="4267865">Well, this is part of the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.964" offset="4275179">If you can't satisfy that definition by virtue of the Act's language at the top of the page here, you are an immigrant, and the Act, in fact, in another section, in Section 214, presumes that you are an immigrant unless you establish that you are a non-immigrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.958" offset="4339231">The plaintiffs argue that this means, this failure -- they don't contend, let me start there that there are people in this country who cannot be found to perform the labor that the commuters perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.381" offset="4396910">They claim that the availability of this labor simply means that these non-immigrants can't enter, they fall into another land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.408" offset="4428988">They're neither non-immigrants nor they are the immigrants, because if they were non-immigrants, they could come in with non-immigrant visas unless they were otherwise excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.456" offset="4457200">They read this as an exclusion when it appears in a definitional section, it's part of the definition, and the whole structure of the Act is designed to make it difficult unless you comply specifically with the language of the definitional statutes to enter as non-immigrants, non-immigrants who can enter without regard to numerical limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.613" offset="4529821">And for that reason, most often, aliens seek to enter as non-immigrants because it's difficult to obtain immigrant visas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.218" offset="4556257">And for that reason, the Act starts with a presumption that you're an immigrant, that you can't satisfy the non-immigrant definition, you're an immigrant and sometimes that means you can't come in at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.586" offset="4593768">Well, in this case, the plaintiffs have argued that this is an exclusionary provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.226" offset="4616234">It's not at all and it wasn't intended to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.438" offset="4625115">The Act very clearly -- excuse me, the legislative history to which I referred before, very clearly distinguished between commuters on the one hand whom they recognized the Service was treating as resident aliens and what they called temporarily agricultural labor on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.337" offset="4696691">That referred to the labor that had been brought in under a series of special legislation -- legislative provisions to relieve manpower shortages during critical times for harvesting and so forth and a determination was made that there should be some permanent provision in legislation to permit this kind of relief of manpower shortages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.359" offset="4780805">But there was no suggestion that commuters were to be put into that category because the committee that was examining the immigration practice realized that commuters were not -- were part of the stable labor pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.630" offset="4837857">They were here and they came in regularly and they were treated under the prior Act as having been lawfully admitted for permanent residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.983" offset="4867323">It was to expand the existing labor pool that they made this provision of section -- subsection (H) (ii), and it was not in any way and effort to exclude aliens -- to exclude commuters.</text>

            <text syncTime="1826.245" offset="7408306">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.173" offset="7420113">Perhaps, the most important purpose of the immigration laws is to protect domestic labor and if either commuters are non-immigrants or they are immigrants who need immigrant visas it is undisputed that they cannot come into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.629" offset="7481866">And the reason they can't come into the United States is because in either of those eventualities, they need a certification by the Department of Labor, which states that they are not domestic workers available to carry out that work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.329" offset="7536724">And in fact, the Department of Labor has determined, there is domestic labor available to carry out the work of agricultural labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.630" offset="7573922">Now, it is possible that automobile workers or workers in other kinds of jobs, could come into the United States, either as non-immigrants or as immigrants needing immigrant visas, if in fact they were not -- there was not domestic labor available to do the work that they were seeking to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.733" offset="7646333">But this case involves agricultural labor and it is undisputed, there is ample domestic agricultural labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.006" offset="7679352">Our basic position in this case is that the statutory language is absolutely clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.094" offset="7703698">We do not rely on the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.734" offset="7714356">hat we do argue is that such legislative history is there is, supports our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.191" offset="7740165">The legislative history is very scant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.733" offset="7750301">The 1950 report is not an affirmation that the commuter practice was legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.202" offset="7772139">It is part of a lengthy description of existing immigration practices and so what it did is describe and describe accurately that commuters were entering the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.579" offset="7813726">I might say daily commuters at that time, there were no appreciable number of seasonal commuters.</text>

            <text syncTime="1959.851" offset="7942771">The government in its lengthy brief and in its submission, it doesn't address the Service's own description of what the commuter practice is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.965" offset="7983208">The Service admits that the commuter practice is an amiable fiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.278" offset="8004524">It does not fit within statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.573" offset="8013615">It is said that over and over again and it's cited on pages 45 to 47 of our brief, their description of what the commuter practice is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.735" offset="8046320">And so despite the effort now to try to fit it within some statutory language, I think, it's a fair statement that it doesn't fit very well, if it all, within any statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.040" offset="8087489">The basic argument of the government is that this is going on for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.479" offset="8109328">Congress has not changed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.276" offset="8116433">There had been various Bills before Congress at different times to change it and that that ought be reason enough to allow the practice to continue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2067.552" offset="8373582">First of all we contend, under Section 211 (b), and that's the starting point, if they cannot come within Section 211 (b), then they have to have immigrant visas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.447" offset="8421125">Now, 211 (b) starts out by saying that they have to be “returning resident immigrants.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.665" offset="8454040">Now the government admits they're not residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.313" offset="8468668">Now, it's interesting what the government does to -- let me just state briefly what the statute says about residence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2126.831" offset="8610670">The government argues that the defined in Section 101 (a) 27 (b) means that you look solely to Section 101 (a) 27 (b), and that that definition becomes the only specification that has to be satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.901" offset="8679006">I suggest at the very least, 211 (b) means that Section 101 (a) 27 (b) is intended to be a definition of returning resident immigrants, and that it makes extremely little sense to then read Section 101 (a) 27 (b) to include non-residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.121" offset="8767822">That what they've in effect done is read out of the statute entirely, the phrase resident in 211 (b).</text>

            <text syncTime="2184.497" offset="8841383">But it said as to daily commuters, the daily commuters might -- could treat their place of employment as their place of residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.841" offset="8886732">We submit that that is directly inconsistent with the definition of residence in the statute, and residence is explicitly defined as I've said to be principal, actual dwelling place in fact without regard to intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2523.765" offset="10198392">In 1965, that was taken further by saying, unless he found that there were no workers available, then you couldn't come in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2545.067" offset="10283656">But it's one of those dates anyway that is the crucial time when this practice meant something, because what it meant at that time, for the first time, was that this practice was allowed, was being used to evade substantive provisions of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2839.515" offset="11461465">Some farm workers, originally it was farm workers in California than the intervenors, who was farm workers in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.576" offset="11493648">Now in order to fit within Section 101 (a) 27 (b), the commuters have to be lawfully admitted for permanent residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.721" offset="11534294">The phrase lawfully admitted for permanent residence is used in a number of other sections of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.887" offset="11558954">In all the other sections of the Act, I think, it's fair to say that it would be almost incredible for Congress to have intended, to have included commuters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.089" offset="11599705">Let me just give one example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.625" offset="11625827">If commuters are lawfully admitted for permanent residence, it comes within a provision which states that a spouse, parent, or child of a citizen or of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, can enter the United States without a Department of Labor certification that no domestic workers are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.629" offset="11709837">Now, what this would mean is that these commuters could bring in any of their relatives, including their children, and one would have built into this system, a permanent exemption from the Labor certification requirements, because the exemption could be passed on from generation to generation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.676" offset="11802102">Now, the government says, those issues as to the other sections can be put aside for the purposes of this litigation and they can be determined some other time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.194" offset="11844106">But the statute says that this definition of lawfully admitted for permanent residence is a definition for the entire statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.410" offset="11877021">And the House report says, that's why this very definition is so important, because it does have many ramifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.300" offset="11908577">And we submit that whatever rule is adopted in this case, has got to be a rule that will apply to lawfully admitted for permanent residence for all of its uses in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.960" offset="11967195">Let me go to the second part of Section 101 (a) 27 (b) which relates to returning from a temporary visit abroad and the Chief Justice had a colloquy with counsel about, whether it goes to a visit into the Southern France.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.880" offset="12034905">That phrase actually dates back in the statute until 1921, and there have been several cases decided under it and they are cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.802" offset="12070536">And those cases may clear that that visit to Southern France is exactly what the intent was of that kind -- of that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.561" offset="12105644">It was intended and this is what the Secretary of Labor determined back in 1924 and that was the time when he was the enforcer of the immigration laws and by number of other courts to apply only to persons with domiciles in this country, not just residence, domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.497" offset="12177324">Now, it's obvious that commuters not only don't have residences, but they clearly don't have domiciles here either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.622" offset="12205850">Let me turn now to the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.284" offset="12220479">We submit that even if and of course we argue that they don't, but even if they came within Section 211 (b) and Section 101 (a) 27 (b), they still wouldn't be admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.743" offset="12266350">The regulations somehow were even stronger than the statute, They allow a person to come -- an alien to come in without an immigrant visa and I'm quoting “only if they are returning to an un-relinquished, lawful, permanent residence in the United States after a temporary absence abroad.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.485" offset="12365302">Now, it's hard to imagine how anybody could write language which is more clear that you've got to have residence in this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="3170.453" offset="12785142">The government argued up to now, that it didn't matter whether they came within the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.047" offset="12807607">It said that that regulation was only just permissive of what -- of when people could come in, that outside of any regulations, they can allow people into the country under the practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.884" offset="12858911">Now that position, I think, is so flagrantly wrong, that's why it's been abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.347" offset="12876779">It's wrong because Section 211 (b) makes very clear that the only basis for coming into the country without an immigrant visa is pursuant to regulations, and I think that that is clearly right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.024" offset="12923486">I think that's the government's position today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.306" offset="12932577">Now the Government therefore goes back to the language of the regulations, and what it says is, despite that language of un-relinquished, lawful, permanent residence, it doesn't mean that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.042" offset="12971551">It says it's not artfully drawn, that what the regulations and that's their word, that what the regulations really mean is the status of coming in to the United States, but we submit that that's simply rewriting the regulations that the regulations are clear on their face.</text>

            <text syncTime="3710.222" offset="14944214">Sometimes they come twice a week or three times a week rather than daily, but they are regular commuters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.483" offset="14965321">Some of them come to permanent job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.177" offset="14972113">Some of them come to look for employment everyday or to look for a temporary employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.207" offset="14988204">It matters not, because the only reason that would make any difference is if you agree with the plaintiffs' contention here that these people must be treated as non-immigrants if they're coming to perform temporary service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.715" offset="15038255">It just doesn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.942" offset="15043166">The definition includes what Mr. Terris would like to read as an exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.211" offset="15060198">It is part of the definition that if there are people available to perform this labor, these people are not non-immigrants, they're immigrants, and the only way they can come into this country is either with an immigrant visa or with an informal documentation like a green card.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.975" offset="15119235">So there are two classes as I see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.958" offset="15131251">I think, they are indistinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.552" offset="15137625">The government's position as I understood Mr. Terris is to be is that they stand or fall together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.558" offset="15161553">The only conceivable distinction aside from the notion that one class is non-immigrants and the other isn't is that one practice has lasted longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.631" offset="15197915">But the practice has not -- that seasonal commuter practice grew up really at a time after a series of temporary measures for bringing a temporary labor into the country had expired and it was -- it's not a new legal theory, it was just a new category of workers who took advantage of what was already there for their benefit already.</text>
