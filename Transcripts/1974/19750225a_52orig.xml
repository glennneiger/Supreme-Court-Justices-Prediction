            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear arguments next in United States against Florida, 52 original.</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="80.267" offset="424417">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.411" offset="437060">This case is a consolidated proceeding that resembles in several respects, each of the two immediately proceeding tidelands cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.759" offset="478438">Like United States against Maine, this case presents the broad constitutional question whether the separate coastal states have the constitutional right wholly independent of the Submerged Lands Act to exploit the resources of the Outer Continental Shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.784" offset="550536">And like United States against Louisiana in which argument was heard yesterday, this case presents number of narrower statutory questions pertaining to the application of the Submerged Lands Act to particular coastal area.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.573" offset="613648">Although, the preceding arguments have discussed at some length, the history of tidelands litigation in this Court, I think that in order to put this case in context, it would be helpful briefly to recapitulate that history here.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.022" offset="679476">The history of tidelands litigation has two strands, one constitutional and one statutory.Both of those strands are interwoven in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.735" offset="722317">Constitutional strand begins with this Court's decision in United States against California in which it was held that the United States and not the separate coastal states had the right to exploit the seabed resources of the three-mile marginal sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.342" offset="792743">That principle of federal maritime paramountcy was confirmed and extended to the Outer Continental Shelf in this Court's decisions in the Louisiana and Texas cases in 339 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.609" offset="849795">Shortly after those decisions, the Congress enacted the Submerged Lands Act and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act in which it had allotted the seabed rights of the territorial sea, generally speaking, to the separate coastal states and the seabed of the Outer Continental Shelf to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.865" offset="930879">The Atlantic coast states, including the State of Florida now claim that they have a constitutional right to all of the seabed rights of the Outer Continental Shelf, and that the principle of federal maritime paramountcy announced by this Court in California was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.443" offset="1009142">They claim that the Submerged Lands Act and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act are unconstitutional insofar as they deny the states the right to exploit the resources of the Outer Continental Shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.770" offset="1066402">However, the other Atlantic coast states based their claim on British maritime history in colonial maritime history as we've just seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.048" offset="1107571">State of Florida however bases its claim not on such history, but rather upon its 1868 constitutional boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.855" offset="1142784">Since the claim is Florida, we're so different from those of the other Atlantic coast states.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.204" offset="1164204">This case was severed from that of United States against Maine and tried separately before the Special Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.250" offset="1192417">That is the background of what might be called the constitutional aspect of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.388" offset="1212897">The statutory aspect of the case derives from this Court's decision in United States against Florida, 363 U.S. 121 that the state is entitled under the Submerged Lands Act to the seabed rights within its historic boundary in the Gulf of Mexico out to a maximum of three marine leagues from the coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.614" offset="1301817">Since the state is only entitled to three miles and not three leagues in the Atlantic Ocean, this Court retain jurisdiction to determine the location of the line separating the Atlantic Ocean from the Gulf of Mexico and also to define the state's coastline in the gulf.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.308" offset="1376632">Those statutory issues where consolidated with the constitutional issue and tried together before the Special Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.604" offset="1409755">The Special Master rejected Florida's constitutional claim as incompatible with this Court's decisions in the California, Louisiana, and Texas cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.179" offset="1452074">It concluded that the state is entitled only to those seabed rights granted in the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.250" offset="1484361">The Special Master defined the line separating the Atlantic Ocean from the Gulf of Mexico as a line running due north from Cuba to the Dry Tortugas Islands, the outer islands of the chain of keys and then following along, the outer curve of the keys up to the mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.155" offset="1575999">He then held that the state was entitled to seabed rights out of three miles to the east of the mainland itself of the keys into three leagues in the Gulf of Mexico, north of the keys and west of the mainland.</text>

            <text syncTime="394.016" offset="1679444">That Key Biscayne is just south of Miami Beach.</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="406.813" offset="1730644">This map is a trifle misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.729" offset="1738271">This body of land is in fact the Key Largo which is a separate island that it separated from the mainland by only a very narrow stream of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.009" offset="1779440">So narrow that it was impractical to represent it on the map, but it runs right along here so that the mainland in fact would run in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.658" offset="1846000">Perhaps the principle question disputed before the Special Master was the location of the coastline in this area, north of the keys and the state had contented that a line running from the Dry Tortugas up to Cape Romano on the mainland mark the seaward limit of its inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.686" offset="1934085">It claimed this large roughly semi-circular body of comparatively deep water in the Gulf of Mexico was in fact the historic bay, and therefore in the waters of the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="475.022" offset="2003466">I think it's in the nature of the about a 100 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.661" offset="2022066">The scale as you can see is 30 miles.</text>

            <text syncTime="485.246" offset="2044322">30 nautical miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.797" offset="2062608">So, it looks like roughly 100 nautical miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.314" offset="2084655">The Special Master rejected that contention of the state but held sua sponte that the eastern portion of the bay marked by a line running from night key up to the mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.761" offset="2142438">The east cape of Cape Sable was a juridical bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.070" offset="2159679">That line is approximately 24 geographic miles, actually a little bit more than 24 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.453" offset="2193220">The Special Master also held sua sponte that the outer islands, the Tortugas, the Marquesas and the Lower Florida Keys should be in circle by baselines and he denominated the waters within the baseline so described as inland waters of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.112" offset="2283813">The state here accepts to virtually every one of the Special Master's major determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.829" offset="2310666">The United States accepts only to the use of closing lines and of baselines in the area of the Florida Bay and the outer island to measure the Submerged Lands Act grant and to mark the inland waters of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.383" offset="2384854">I turn now to the discussion of the exceptions made by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.814" offset="2402617">I will take up first the issue that this case has in common with United States against Maine; that is the broad constitutional question of whether the state possesses a right to exploit the resources of the Outer Continental Shelf without regard to any limits imposed by the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.063" offset="2487672">The other Atlantic coast states in United States against Maine claimed the entire Outer Continental Shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.349" offset="2520795">If this Court should contrary to our submissions in that case decide to overrule the California decision and decide the case in favor of the states, Florida presumably will advance similar claim to the Outer Continental Shelf under the equal footing doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.477" offset="2597282">But any issues under the equal footing doctrine are not presented here, in Florida in this litigation claims not the entire continental shelf but only that portion of it within its historic maritime boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.917" offset="2659035">That boundary even under the states rather generous description encompasses considerably less than the entire continental shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.161" offset="2696025">Historic boundary upon which --</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="keith_a_jones" startTime="656.331" stopTime="1081.292">
            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="656.331" offset="2728730">Well, the continental shelf varies in width from as little as six miles to as much as I think 200 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.767" offset="2770422">Their historic maritime boundary even at most generous description of it would not I think extend more than 30 miles offshore at any point.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.644" offset="2821935">So that at least at some portions of the coast, it would be considerably less than the entire Outer Continental Shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.132" offset="2863940">As I say, the historic boundary upon which the state relies is that set forth in its 1868 Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.906" offset="2894973">Now, it's a good deal of argument before the Special Master as to the actual location of that boundary line and I do not propose to renew that argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.140" offset="2939904">It's discussed at length in the Special Master's opinion in our briefs and I rely upon that discussion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.207" offset="2976162">One reason I don't discuss the actual location of the boundary is that in the view, we take of this case the state's historic boundary as largely irrelevant to the proper allocation of seabed rights, that's between the state and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.390" offset="3040946">I would say however that both parties agree that at least one point along the coast, the area of water between the Marquesas Keys and the Dry Tortugas, the states historic boundary did extend beyond the maximum limits of the Submerged Lands Act, so that even under the more restrictive view, we take of the states historic boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.120" offset="3135822">They would if this Court decided the constitutional issue in their favor be entitled to some seabed rights in addition to what was granted under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.436" offset="3177096">But that fact we think does not avail Florida here.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.588" offset="3193710">In the first place, this case is foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.643" offset="3209906">The states constitutional claim is foreclosed by the California decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.182" offset="3232057">This case is on all force with the California.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.719" offset="3246268">Like Florida, California had a maritime boundary that had been approved by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.663" offset="3274062">This Court held that that congressional approval of the boundary authorized the state to exercise certain local police power functions in the area of the marginal sea encompass by its historic boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.819" offset="3338637">But that those functions did not detract from the federal Government's paramount rights empower over that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.734" offset="3374268">The Court reasoned that the United States had acquired the seabed rights or had acquired the marginal sea in the exercise of its foreign affairs and defense powers, and therefore that the United States and not the separate coastal states where entitled to the seabed rights within that marginal sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.810" offset="3450650">The Solicitor General of the preceding cases set forth our reasons why this Court should adhere to its California decision and I will not elaborate upon that argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.474" offset="3497253">My only point is that if this Court does adhere to its California decision, nothing more need be said with regard to Florida's constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.962" offset="3547199">But even if this Court did depart from its consistent pattern of tidelands decisions and overrule California in the principle of federal maritime paramountcy for which its stands, Florida's claim would still have to be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.660" offset="3618043">The reason for that is that in 1962 after enactment of the Submerged Lands Act, the state formally relinquished by constitutional amendment any claim that might otherwise had to seabed rights seaward of the maximum limits of the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.177" offset="3704038">That 1962 constitutional amendment replaced Florida's 1868 boundary on which it relies here with a more clearly defined boundary that corresponds precisely with the maximum limit of its Submerged Lands Act grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.790" offset="3778539">That new boundary would mark the outer limits of any permissible constitutional claim other than under the equal footing doctrine that Florida could make.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.845" offset="3822738">Thus there's no theory of law in this case under which Florida's claim could be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.288" offset="3852518">Therefore, I turn to the questions relating to the application of the Submerged Lands Act to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.704" offset="3886164">The first of these questions might be stated as “Where is the Gulf of Mexico”, or more precisely, “What is the line separating the Gulf of Mexico from the Atlantic Ocean for purposes of the Submerged Lands Act?”</text>
            <text syncTime="961.276" offset="3948440">There's really very little to be said on this question because the evidence is essentially all along the federal Government side.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.630" offset="3981876">It's true that Congress in enacting the Submerged Lands Act did not purport to define those two bodies of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.786" offset="4010506">There's nothing in the legislative history that suggests what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.335" offset="4028688">But cartographers, geographers, explorers, historians, and other writers have all agreed that the line running due north from Cuba to the Dry Tortugas, and from there, following the outer curve of the Keys to the mainland is the maritime border between the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.427" offset="4129102">That is the line set by the International Hydrographic Bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.214" offset="4144253">That is the line fixed by all geographers and cartographers as the evidence before the Special Master showed, and the state presented absolutely no evidence whatsoever that would suggest that Congress intended any other line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.079" offset="4203708">Indeed, shortly after enactment of the Submerged Lands Act, the Florida legislature itself with specific reference to the Submerged Lands Act stated in legislation that the Florida Straits, Straits of Florida there, are an arm of the Atlantic Ocean, not of the Gulf of Mexico as the state claims here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.689" offset="4302137">It's only when this litigation began that the Florida legislature realized that perhaps it had acted adversely to its own litigating position and revoked that Act in 1971.</text>

            <text syncTime="1129.609" offset="4621772">Well, if you decided against the United States in this case on the constitutional question, then you wouldn't have to decide the dividing line between the Atlantic and the Gulf, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.033" offset="4679555">You would simply make reference to the state's historical boundary, and there is no disagreement between the state and the federal Government as to its historical boundary south of the Keys.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.409" offset="4744965">On short, we believe that the Special Master's determination of a line dividing the two bodies of water, the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico is firmly grounded in the evidence and reflects the common understanding on which the Submerged Lands Act was based.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.745" offset="4814346">The remaining questions in this case all relate to the definition of Florida's coastline in the general area of the Florida Keys.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.417" offset="4921031">The state claims that this large body of water marked by this closing line is a historic bay and it is inland waters of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.360" offset="4968782">We believe that it's clear that there's no foundation either in fact or in law for that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.506" offset="4993442">To the contrary, the federal Government has affirmatively and decisively disclaimed any historic title in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.734" offset="5034297">Before this issue even arose in litigation, the federal Government had distributed to foreign Governments maps showing that the United States territorial sea in the area of the Florida Keys was measured three miles out from the natural shoreline, and that representation of course was wholly inconsistent with the existence of the historic bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.960" offset="5135235">Necessary inference of the maps which we distributed was that United States claimed no historic bay in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.796" offset="5174523">We believe that in -- that a disclaimer of that kind disclaimer made to foreign governments in advance of any domestic litigation should be given preclusive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.879" offset="5222902">We think that in the face of that disclaimer, Florida's contrary claim was barred as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.793" offset="5250591">But even if the disclaimer is not given preclusive effect in that kind, in nevertheless, imposes upon the state the burden of proving its historic title is clear beyond doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.590" offset="5301687">The standard applied by this Court in the Second California case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.279" offset="5320495">That is clear that the state's evidence did not meet that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.878" offset="5338885">Under this Court's prior decisions, the state would have had to show three elements to prove its historic title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.932" offset="5367097">It would have had to show that it had made a claim, a long standing claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.659" offset="5389981">Second, it would have had to show that accompanying that claim had been the continuous assertion of sovereign authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.733" offset="5418297">And third, that there had been for an acquiescence expressed or tacit in that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.527" offset="5445465">The states evidence felt for short for making any of the three necessary showings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.948" offset="5475140">As to the existence of a claim, the state relied almost exclusively upon its 1868 constitutional boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.508" offset="5513383">But the Special Master found that that boundary in fact did not run along the line claim by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.302" offset="5540551">It is the seaward limit of its inland waters, but rather ran along the inner perimeter of this area, and that construction we believe is based upon a solid reading of the constitutional language of Florida's boundary upon the evidence of contemporaneous activities in the area of the Keys adduce before the Special Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.877" offset="5654862">The reasons we would present for supporting that boundary or set forth in our brief and also the Special Master's report, I do not repeat them here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.251" offset="5696345">It suffices to say that if this -- if that construction is accepted, Florida's claim of historic title is necessarily defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.977" offset="5743261">Moreover, we believe that Florida's evidence with respect to the other two requirements of historic bay it was if anything even weaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.899" offset="5774921">That evidence again is recounted in the Special Master's report and in our briefs in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.269" offset="5796446">I won't repeat it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.014" offset="5803447">I will only point out that United States did clearly establish before the Special Master and the state concedes here in its brief at page 48 of its opening brief that foreign ships have fished, do fish, historically have fish and do fish in the Florida Bay without any interference whatsoever by the State of Florida.</text>

            <text syncTime="3091.630" offset="12469896">It's a series of Keys, some large, some smaller which really are so closely connected to the mainland or so close to the mainland as for practical purposes probably to be part of the mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.964" offset="12527261">And this point between Upper Matecumbe Key and keys further to the southwest, there are water gaps which are wide enough some over a mile in width to completely separate those islands in our view from the mainland, and to make it impermissible to draw baselines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.084" offset="12603747">But I would further add that baseline running down along a chain of violence would serve no purpose at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.918" offset="12631019">It would not enclose any body of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.368" offset="12640841">It would simply deny passage between the islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.109" offset="12655783">That would serve no legitimate interest of the state and it would interfere with foreign navigation in some instances with no counter-bailing considerations in its favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.737" offset="12714297">That's the problem with the baselines drawn by the Special Master in the outer islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.256" offset="12732374">It serves no purposes in his report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.887" offset="12746898">The Florida is grant of under the Submerged Lands Act would be essentially the same whether you use baselines or not, and they're merely gratuitous in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3311.669" offset="13350013">First of all, the water gaps that Mr. Jones refers to of a mile between the Keys, I would point out that most of those are more than two feet deep.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.133" offset="13391914">There are couple of six and seven foot channels, but there was testimony presented before the Special Master that one could begin walking at Key Biscayne and walked the entire distance to Key West during low tide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.942" offset="13447189">So, we're not talking about substantial water gaps of depth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.660" offset="13465997">Secondly, what counts is what was the historical setup of this land in 1868 and the maps that where presented in the record indicate that this was one mass of land with very little separation in 1868 and as a matter of fact, there were mudflats from the Key Biscayne all they way to Key West.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.729" offset="13554291">I would also point out that what Indonesia and the Philippines do with regard to their islands is totally immaterial to this boundary dispute and we should not be bound in the dispute with the federal government over what will happen in the Indonesia or the Philippines.</text>

            <text syncTime="3389.624" offset="13661915">There is evidence and we have maps from the 1700s that show this entire massive land and mudflats without hardly any separation at all between the Keys.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.024" offset="13703502">With regard to the exercise of sovereign power by the State in Florida Bay, may I remind the Government that in 1964, they supported us in the Barrios case which came to this Court where we prosecuted two Cuban fishermen for the violation of our state fishing laws and the Government filed the brief in favor of our exercise of sovereign jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.228" offset="13788244">I would also point out in response to a question asked by Mr. Justice Powell that foreign fishing has not been allowed in the eastern portion of Florida Bay and it has not been allowed in this entire portion on a historical basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.000" offset="13847385">I would also point out that the 1962 Florida Constitutional Amendment which they refer to as a waiver of the state's rights was not approved by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.324" offset="13888658">So therefore, it cannot constitute a waiver Florida's historical boundary and 1868 is our only lawful boundary because that was the only boundary approved by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.639" offset="13929932">I would also point out that the 1962 amendment to the constitution in Florida cannot be anymore effective as far as hurting us than the 1968 Amendment could in helping us because in the 1968 Amendments of the Florida constitution, it readopted almost verbatim the 1868 boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.930" offset="14011120">So, what we're left with is that the only lawful boundary of the State of Florida is the 1868 boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.004" offset="14039437">With regard to the 1955 statute that was passed by the State of Florida which mentioned gratuitously that the Straits of Florida were located in the Atlantic rather than in the Gulf, and here the Straits of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.897" offset="14094921">With regard to that, I would point out that this statute was passed by the legislature in response to the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.701" offset="14130134">It certainly cannot affect what is based on expert testimony, and that is marine geology and sedimentology.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.294" offset="14160541">The testimony is clear that this, it is a Gulf area and that this is the Atlantic, and the Gulf and the Atlantic are separated at Cape Florida.</text>

            <text syncTime="4373.472" offset="17597210">Because we think that the facts in California are not identical, that it's a different situation that this Court never decided where the California had a historical boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4383.274" offset="17636498">And in this case, you've already -- the Court has decided in original 9 that Florida does have a historic marine boundary that give us rights beyond three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4393.187" offset="17676100">And subsequent in other words, it's our position that the Submerged Lands Act since it very clearly states, nothing shall be taken to prejudice the rights of any state to establish a boundary beyond three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4405.437" offset="17725106">And then this Court in United States versus Louisiana, the 363 U.S. page 1 decision, this Court said, “it was suggested that Mississippi and Alabama might claim boundary six leagues”, which of course is an excess of three; six leagues in the Gulf because of similar provisions and the acts admitting them to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4427.286" offset="17812564">He went on to say and this Justice Harlan, “it was recognize that if the legal existence of such boundaries could be established, they would clearly entitle the respective states to submerge land rights to that distance under an application of the Pollard's rule to the marginal sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.075" offset="17879646">Hence, while a three-mile boundary was expressly confirmed for all coastal states, the rights of the Gulf States to prove boundaries in excess of three miles was preserved.</text>

            <text syncTime="4470.803" offset="17986539">Now obviously, this historical boundary that's located out in the -- the historical boundary that's located out in Florida Bay would be in excess of three leagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="4486.455" offset="18049233">So, we are dealing with the nearly an excess of three leagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="4490.146" offset="18063966">So, it's our contention that we have ownership interest and the disputed area off of our coastline, it's our contention that the rule of Pollard's lessee should apply and that the extent of our jurisdiction was declared in the early of U.S.versus Florida position to be that which we have in 1868 as described in the state constitution of that date and approve by the Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="4525.997" offset="18207326">Florida should retain eminent domain over the shores of her territory and over the submerged lands that are here in question.</text>

            <text syncTime="4555.234" offset="18324355">I'd like to call your attention to the call in the Constitution, and that is from the Tortugas, you go thence northeastwardly to a point three leagues from the mainland, thence northeastwardly to a point three leagues from the mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="4570.292" offset="18384541">Now, the Master has concluded that that's only a general overall direction and he in effect has said that you first go east and then you even go southeast before you start and you follow a three fathom line to a northeastwardly fashion until a point nine nautical miles as reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.125" offset="18467924">Now, it's our view that this construction is so illogical and contrary to the plain meaning of the words as to the ludicrous.</text>
            <text syncTime="4598.928" offset="18499062">Florida contends that the call thence northeastwardly to a point three leagues from the mainland can only mean one thing, and that is a specific compass direction and absolute heading a 45 degrees because there are not geographical directions included in the call such as the northeastwardly along the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="4619.460" offset="18581191">It doesn't say along the coast, it says thence northeastwardly to a point three leagues from the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="4625.568" offset="18605641">The only way that you can go northeastwardly is a point between north and east.</text>
            <text syncTime="4630.097" offset="18623718">It's a direct compass reading of 45 degrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4633.448" offset="18637197">Even the Government's witness, Dr. DeVorcey, testified on cross-examination that northeastwardly means 45 degrees, a point between north and east.</text>
            <text syncTime="4642.815" offset="18674604">And even the Special Master himself, Judge Maris in Michigan versus Ohio original 30 in 1971 interpreted northeast as north 45 degrees east.</text>
            <text syncTime="4655.382" offset="18724864">But in this case for some reason, he went southeast in order to determine what the historical boundary of the State of Florida is.</text>

            <text syncTime="4723.690" offset="18998105">They started to cross this expands the water to the nearest point of the mainland before turning north.</text>

            <text syncTime="4740.197" offset="19064142">It would bring you right to Cape Romano.</text>
            <text syncTime="4744.747" offset="19082324">Shrimpers, we contend, have been doing so for hundreds of years and if the Master's version is accepted, the plain meaning of the words is ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="4751.841" offset="19110745">What's more, he reads into the call, a meaning contrary to the clear import of the words because he draws the boundary not northeastwardly at all, but in a direction southeastwardly from the Tortugas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.477" offset="19153272">Further, the call concludes that it goes to a specific point, that point line, three marine leagues off the mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="4769.351" offset="19180753">Clearly, it requires a straight line, 45 degrees to Cape Romano and northeastwardly standing alone without further references to geographical locations either as commencing midpoint or terminal monuments must mean northeast or north 45 degree east to constitute a definite boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4787.126" offset="19251911">It's a contention of Florida that by virtue of the Act of 1868, Congress expressly or impliedly convey or granted to the state the rights and interest in the title possessed by the United States and the area encompassed by the boundary described in the Florida Constitution in 1868 when Florida was readmitted to the union, which rights include ownership of the submerged lands and resources of the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="4811.178" offset="19348041">Furthermore, the historical boundary in 1868 defines the outer perimeter of an area historically known as Florida Bay which is a historic bay or historic waters and thus, internal or inland waters or the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="4824.492" offset="19401331">The contested area of Florida Bay amounts in about 8,000 square miles, and this boundary as I pointed out is not only as Florida's historic boundary but it's our only lawful boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4836.888" offset="19450964">Now, let me address if I may for a few moments the issue of Florida Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4840.609" offset="19465801">We claim the Florida Bay is a historic bay and thus inland waters of the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="4845.872" offset="19486908">And we construe it to be all of the waters bounded on the south by the Florida Keys to and including the Dry Tortugas, and on the northeast by the Florida peninsula and on the northwest by the Tortugas with a line running 45 degrees from the Tortugas to Cape Romano.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.484" offset="19561305">In determining whether the state has properly acquired historic title to a maritime area, this Court has said that there are three factors; the exercise of authority or sovereignty by either the state or the federal government, the continuity for a long period of time of that exercise, and the attitude of foreign states, in other words, acquiescence by foreign states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4886.758" offset="19650435">In addition, it has been held that a coastal state may strengthen its claim by showing that its vital interest are involved as we did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4894.986" offset="19683349">We contend that we proved our case in all three respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="4899.216" offset="19700276">Our claim of historic title is based upon the occupation of Florida Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.535" offset="19717517">The Master in concluding that we fail to prove our claim ignored we contend compelling evidence to the contrary, and we also contend that he held us to the wrong burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="4914.140" offset="19759940">He said we have to prove it clear beyond doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4917.102" offset="19771747">To apply that burden rather than a preponderance burden was error and the matter should be at the very least to return to the Master for additional testimony and hearings and the application of the correct standard of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="4929.175" offset="19820022">The clear beyond doubt test in California too can only be apply to a state in proving its historical claim where there federal Government by its actions has made an effective disclaimer of sovereign jurisdiction in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.424" offset="19877073">Here, the federal Government tried to disclaim and they introduce several self-serving declarations all made during or within the proximity of the commencement of this litigation and the documents and evidence carry no specific disclaimer that Florida Bay is a historic bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4959.534" offset="19941543">This purported disclaimer should not impose such an owner's burden on the state of clear beyond doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.839" offset="19966725">Also I would point out that the danger zones that had been established by the federal government in this area right here, these danger zones which only allow people to enter that area with permission by the United States Navy certainly represents an act of dominion over Florida Bay by the federal government which cannot be ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="4985.615" offset="20045824">When the authority is asserted pursuant to a statute permitting such exercise of power only in the territorial waters of the United States, they established those danger zones based upon the Congressional Act that allows them to do so only in the territorial waters of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5001.502" offset="20109354">So, they obviously recognized that area as territorial waters not the high seas, and it's hard to see how the United States has disclaimed dominion over the area when they have danger zones that only allow people to come in on permission for the United States Navy of approximately 1,900 square miles.</text>

            <text syncTime="5430.339" offset="21824763">And we can go on and of course, I mentioned to you that the Florida lease lands for oil drilling in Florida Bay beginning in 1941 and this included all of Florida Bay up to the 45-degree line from the Tortugas to Cape Romano.</text>
            <text syncTime="5444.597" offset="21881710">The territorial water acts of the state in 1963 require aliens or foreign nationals to have a license to fish in Florida waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5452.240" offset="21912325">What are the indications of foreign acquiescence which is the third criteria of Florida Bay area?</text>
            <text syncTime="5457.667" offset="21934059">In 1831, the British request to fish in South Florida waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5461.763" offset="21950464">Certainly, indicates acquiescence in control by the state or the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5465.805" offset="21966555">In 1845, Great Britain again asked for permission to fish in Florida waters and enact of the legislature to protect the fisheries of the coast of Florida was pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="5475.378" offset="22004903">Foreign nationals have never challenge marine patrol enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5479.171" offset="22020054">It has been pointed out in the testimony that lack of state enforcement over the Tortugas shrimp beds would just about wipeout a $16 million a year industry and the Government of Cuba has pointed out by Senator Fulbright during the negotiation between Cuba and the United States for the treaty in 1957 to keep Cuban nationals from fishing in the shrimp beds of the Dry Tortugas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5501.873" offset="22110856">Senator Fulbright said that the Cuban Government was honoring the request of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="5506.780" offset="22130500">They had a gentlemen's agreement which certainly indicates acquiescence in the authority of the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="5512.676" offset="22154115">Professor Tebo, who is a professor of emeritus of history at the University of Miami, testified that northward from Key West on the Gulf side, the mainland of sea traffic lay west of Cape Romano.</text>
            <text syncTime="5523.656" offset="22198000">This was a passage inside the cape, but its usage was limited to small boats with skilled navigators.</text>
            <text syncTime="5528.977" offset="22219316">They knew that Tortugas channels through the shallow waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5531.380" offset="22228929">Between these limits, lay the distinctive area and now designated Florida Bay, set aside by geography and history as part of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="5539.115" offset="22259858">And Dr. Samuel Proctor, history professor at University of Florida transcript page 408 said that Floridians and other informed persons at the time knew the importance of the resources adjacent to the Florida coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="5551.113" offset="22307819">They were aware of the importance of these waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5553.139" offset="22315969">Consequently, these men writing Florida's Constitution and operating in the best interest of the state would have wanted to enclose as much of the areas possible within their state boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="5563.031" offset="22355466">This, they sought to do in writing the boundary article in the 1868 Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5569.039" offset="22379499">We have historically exercise police power over the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5572.110" offset="22391829">The 1893 statute prohibiting foreign fishing in Florida waters without a license, the 1915 state laws making all fishing in Florida waters including the bays to be Florida property and the regulation of shrimping in the Tortugas since 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="5587.379" offset="22452851">No one has challenge Florida's exercise of its marine conservation laws except two Cuban vessels which were arrested within three leagues of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="5596.153" offset="22487960">In addition to which, the federal Government in appending case in the United States District Court, the Northern District of Florida, has sought in an injunction against the state and has asserted that Florida attempts to regulate or prohibit foreign fishing boats more than 12 geographic miles from any part of the coastline of the state between Cape Romano and the Dry Tortugas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5616.603" offset="22569775">So, even the federal government recognized that we do attempt to exercise police power all the way out to the 45-degree angle between the Tortugas and Cape Romano.</text>
            <text syncTime="5626.739" offset="22610317">Perhaps the most significant aspect of this case in determining the attitude of foreign governments to Florida's claim of historic title to Florida Bay is the absolute absence of any evidence or hint of evidence from the federal government that any country has in the past 150 years, protested or objected to Florida's overt pack or assertion of sovereign claim to Florida Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="5648.031" offset="22695476">And highly significant in regard to assertion of sovereignty is the Act of the United States Congress in affirming to the world in 1868 that one of the states in the union, Florida had a marine boundary from the Dry Tortugas islands to the mainland which formed the northwest perimeter of the bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="5663.933" offset="22759111">Throughout these proceedings, the United States concern for its position with regard to foreign affairs has been paramount.</text>
            <text syncTime="5670.590" offset="22785755">With all due respect to the Government, foreign affairs is not a material issue, whether work powers, authority over interstate of foreign commerce or authority over international relations maybe exercise within Florida's boundaries, whether marine land or dry land has never been at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5686.945" offset="22851166">These paramount powers we concede may be exercise if appropriate by the federal government in any part of any state at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5696.012" offset="22887424">But just because they may be paramount in Lake Okeechobee which happens to be an inland lake in the State of Florida does not mean that Florida cannot regulate fishing therein or the taking of the minerals from the bottom, from the seabed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5708.797" offset="22938520">Also, there is nothing in the record to indicate that innocent passage of foreign shipping is in fact frustrated by Florida's claim that the keys out to and including the Tortugas constitute in integral part of the state, nor is there any evidence that innocent passage in the area between the keys in the mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="5725.457" offset="23005184">The nominated Florida Bay has or will in any way be denied, should this Court find that it is a historic bay constituting the inland waters of the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="5734.710" offset="23042173">There will be no interruption to the right of innocent passage and this case was not brought in the face of any international dispute involving Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="5742.732" offset="23074252">Our last major point and I think I had just a few -- about six, seven minutes left, five minutes left.</text>
            <text syncTime="5747.740" offset="23094314">My last major point and we preserve all our other arguments in the brief not argued, is that it -- that this case as it relates to Florida does required determination of the rights under the Submerged Lands Act and United States versus Florida that it mandates a determination of the demarcation between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean because if the federal Government assuming arguendo is correct, and we are limited to three marine miles in the Atlantic and three leagues in the Gulf and not any further, then it's imperative that we determine where is the Gulf and where is the Atlantic.</text>
            <text syncTime="5779.035" offset="23219493">We contend that the boundary between these two bodies is at latitude 25 degrees, 40 minutes north the position of Cape Florida which means that the Florida Keys and the Straits of Florida southwestwardly of such latitude are located in the Gulf of Mexico and not in the Atlantic Ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="5795.348" offset="23284799">The Master says everything north of the Tortugas is Gulf and everything south is in the Atlantic, and that dispute here is about a 1,000 square miles, the difference between three leagues and three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="5806.894" offset="23330983">The federal Government takes its description, and by the way, this is their major piece of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5811.947" offset="23351150">I think they are sole piece of evidence on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5814.280" offset="23360449">They take a description from the Gulf which the Master adopts from the International Hydrographic Bureau special publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="5820.900" offset="23386990">They say this proves up their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5823.076" offset="23395662">And in the description itself on the face of the map, it says “these limits have no political significance whatsoever”, and then the authors go on to say that it's not to be regarded as representing the results of a full geographic study.</text>
            <text syncTime="5837.340" offset="23452714">They point out it's primarily for uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5839.986" offset="23463267">We presented the testimony of a renowned expert in marine geology and sedimentology.</text>
            <text syncTime="5845.246" offset="23484374">He testified unequivocally that the International Hydrographic Bureau boundaries between the Gulf and the Atlantic have no scientific basis whatsoever in terms of these parameters that form the basis for the geological and geometric boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="5859.250" offset="23540381">Florida contends that the finding of the Master is incorrect, contrary to the weight of the evidence as to where the Gulf meets the Atlantic.</text>
            <text syncTime="5866.248" offset="23568384">We contend that it should be decided on marine geology and sedimentology and it is best visualized by the fact that if the area were to be viewed, if all the water were removed, a natural drainage basis would appear separating the Gulf and the Atlantic at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5882.031" offset="23631496">Historic evidence, mariner's evidence, geological evidence defining the Straits of Florida and the Florida Keys as being in the Gulf of Mexico was totally ignored by the Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="5892.412" offset="23672978">All of these was subordinate to one piece of evidence, a map, which is I pointed out on its face belies its persuasive effect on the very point for which it was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="5902.796" offset="23714565">The testimony of the state is quite persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5905.000" offset="23723342">Dr. Ginsburg testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="5907.393" offset="23732955">He referred to numerous texts beginning with the 1957 edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica including the 71 edition of McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology, the Bulletin of Geological Society of America 1971, the 1972 edition of the same bulletin.</text>
            <text syncTime="5924.543" offset="23801501">He also -- in each of these, it refers to the Florida shelf or the Florida platform including the Keys and the Tortugas entirely within the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="5934.820" offset="23842670">In addition, he testified how topography identifies the dividing line.</text>
            <text syncTime="5938.910" offset="23858970">The submarine topography visualize as a terrestrial landscape which separate the Gulf and the Atlantic basins.</text>
            <text syncTime="5945.824" offset="23886660">He testifies at 25 degrees, 40 minutes north with the Keys and the Tortugas and the Florida shrimps in the Gulf.</text>
            <text syncTime="5952.826" offset="23914663">He testified how sediment in the capes of dividing line.</text>
            <text syncTime="5955.930" offset="23927097">He said there is a relatively abrupt change between the Coral Reef Limestone, south of Soldier Key to Atlantic type sandy barrier islands, north of Cape Florida, and that that is the major change in the coastal morphology.</text>
            <text syncTime="5969.855" offset="23982791">He also testified as to the organisms that indicated the dividing line.</text>
            <text syncTime="5974.448" offset="24001181">So, our position therefore is that the configuration of the seafloor should control.</text>
            <text syncTime="5978.790" offset="24018526">The States of Florida are part of the Gulf since they were drain into the Gulf if they were dry upland basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5984.427" offset="24041096">The basis for this position is that submarine topography should follow the same criteria as terrestrial topography.</text>
            <text syncTime="5991.401" offset="24068995">Dry land is considered to be part of the basin into which it drains.</text>
            <text syncTime="5994.917" offset="24082996">Since the Straits of Florida were drained into the Gulf, if on the Gulf -- if on dry land, they are part of the Gulf of Mexico basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="6004.218" offset="24120195">They are not part of the Atlantic Ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="6006.262" offset="24128449">So, the weight and the quality of the evidence clearly indicates that Florida's contention as to the location of the Gulf of Mexico is correct.</text>
