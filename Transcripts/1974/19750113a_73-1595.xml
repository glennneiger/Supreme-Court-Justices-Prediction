            <text syncTime="35.339" offset="244694">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.904" offset="262980">My name is Gordon Kean.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.062" offset="267577">I represent Colonial Pipeline Company here on appeal from the decision of Louisiana Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.487" offset="301328">This case presents I think for a decision the question of just how far the states may go in fractionalizing the doing business concept in an effort to levy an excise tax on a purely interstate business before reaching out the limits permitted by the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.868" offset="394846">This is the first time this Court had addressed itself to this specific question as I appreciate it since 1964 when the Court decided the General Motors case by a divided Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.751" offset="462346">And thereon, there had been several state court decisions which I've related to the question as to which this Court declined to accept jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.416" offset="516995">Another consequence of those actions by this Court in declining jurisdiction in the state court cases, it raised the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.016" offset="555447">The Louisiana Supreme Court commented in passing upon the question that there had been a serious inroad in the traditional immunity of purely interstate business operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.923" offset="623052">For this reason, I think the, the Court here because of the facts and the background of the Louisiana law that I shall detail to the Court, had a unique opportunity to again declare where the line is to drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.573" offset="697657">The facts as I outline them in the law under which this case occur I think placed the issue in rather sharp focus, so that the Court is in a position to decide whether or not and how far the states may go in fractionalizing the business concept as a basis for the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.645" offset="805909">The Colonial Pipeline is a Delaware corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.432" offset="825135">It operates in interstate commerce, transporting for others as a common carrier under the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission refined petroleum products for others.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.061" offset="887620">Under these circumstances, this is not a case such as that before the Court in General Motors which was the last time this issue was before the Court because Colonial does not own and does not deliver in the State of Louisiana any of the products which it transports through its line.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.558" offset="973615">Neither is this an in lieu tax case such as this Court used as a basis for distinguishing the Virginia franchise tax which was before the Court in the second Railway Express case from Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.043" offset="1043519">This tax is levied by the very expressed language of the Louisiana statute in addition to all other taxes which have paid by Colonial Pipeline in the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.308" offset="1096600">As I indicated, Colonial is an interstate county --</text>

            <label>Mr. R. Gordon Kean, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="255.589" offset="1125752">Colonial passed a Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the property tax on its facilities which are located in the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.328" offset="1164727">It pays an apportioned income tax based upon income derived from its operations in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.863" offset="1190849">It pays the sales and use tax in connection with such operations as it conducts in the state it pays all of that range of taxes that just as any other operator in the state would pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.634" offset="1245915">Our position is that with respect to the franchise tax that there is nothing which Louisiana gives to Colonial as a basis upon which to levy that tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.363" offset="1308818">Our position is that Colonial is operating in interstate commerce as a corporation and under the Constitution and statutes of the United States it hasn't derived the right to operate in interstate commerce and therefore, Louisiana gives to -- gives to Colonial with respect to the privilege of franchise tax nothing for which it could demand compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.561" offset="1405576">We do not contend them that Colonial on a traditional case is decided by this case does not owe the property tax, that it does not owe the income tax, or the sales and use tax although which this Court is clearly recognized that the interstate carrier must be responsible for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="349.445" offset="1501184">Well, if you prevail here, what's to prevent Louisiana from merely increasing the rates of its income tax of the same amount as your franchise tax?</text>

            <label>Mr. R. Gordon Kean, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="359.903" offset="1542980">Well, I think that if they increase the rates of the corporation income tax, they got to increase those rates across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.184" offset="1576103">Certainly, they couldn't single out the interstate commerce as a basis for a differential in income tax payment in the State of Louisiana what it would otherwise establish for other companies operating in that state.</text>

            <text syncTime="380.944" offset="1627199">Let me put it in another way then, explain first the -- how that Colonial's tax burden in Louisiana is different from the burden born by domestic corporations?</text>

            <label>Mr. R. Gordon Kean, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="397.598" offset="1693759">As I view it, Mr. Justice Blackmun, colonial pays the property tax for which it has the right to and to get police protection for protection in the other protection that a state would afford on to those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.062" offset="1763662">Colonial as an interstate carrier as I see it, if it is compelled to pay the Louisiana privileged tax for no right which Louisiana itself gives to Colonial.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.963" offset="1827192">Then under those circumstances, we have a tax on interstate commerce which I say to the Court is prohibited by the prior decisions of this Court and if is permitted then under the circumstances, we have a situation where the states can then control the question of interstate commerce against their principle that the Commerce Clause was created for.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="454.288" stopTime="464.017">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="454.288" offset="1920502">Well then, I go back to my other question, why can't Louisiana accomplish the same thing by increasing the income tax across the board if you will?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="r_gordon_kean" startTime="464.017" stopTime="514.789">
            <label>Mr. R. Gordon Kean, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="464.017" offset="1959476">Well, they could perhaps increase the income tax across the board so if all the corporations in the State of Louisiana pay an increased income tax and under those circumstances, it may well be that they would accomplish otherwise the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.675" offset="2018095">But I say to the Court again that where this tax is levied on the privilege upon doing business in corporate form as the Louisiana Supreme Court construed it to be, then that gets to the authority and right of the corporation to exist and under those circumstances, if that corporation is engaged in interstate commerce, solely in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.139" offset="2111927">And it's our view that the state has a right to the power of taxation on the privilege or the right to do business in corporate form to in effect destroy the state commerce.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="514.789" offset="2162500">You could say then in effect that even though Louisiana can and I gather does impose the same tax on domestic corporations, it can impose it on your client.</text>

            <text syncTime="525.086" offset="2203669">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.954" offset="2207222">My position Mr. Justice Rehnquist is that the privilege or the tax upon the right to do business in corporate form as the Louisiana Court construed this tax to be imposed on is a right which Colonial engaging as it does in interstate commerce derives from the Federal Constitution and therefore Louisiana gives to Colonial nothing for which they could expect recompense in so far as the privilege tax is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="555.482" offset="2325295">But why do you concede then that Louisiana can subject Colonial to an income tax?</text>

            <text syncTime="559.941" offset="2343163">For the simple reason that this Court has held in the prior cases that are fairly apportioned income tax is that it can be levied against an interstate carrier because it's on the income as distinguished from the right to carry on the interstate business.</text>

            <text syncTime="757.090" offset="3131747">It was a tax on income and if that income tax was fairly apportioned, so you didn't have a multiplicity of the same kind of tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="775.989" offset="3207293">Now, we're here dealing and I'll go back again if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.695" offset="3234147">Let me try to give a little bit of the background of Colonial's operations in the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.719" offset="3270196">They operate -- Colonial operates a pipeline system they say transporting refined petroleum products for others of some 3,500 miles of pipeline all the way from Houston, Texas to the New York, Calberry.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.823" offset="3338637">Some 258 miles of that pipeline traverse the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.949" offset="3363192">The collector admits and the Louisiana Courts found that everything that Colonial was doing in the State of Louisiana was related to an integral part of its interstate movement of these profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.600" offset="3429752">Colonial does know intrastate business in the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.409" offset="3448978">Everything it does is related to interstate movement of its products and under the circumstances, there are no local activities as we view them.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.398" offset="3501014">In the State of Louisiana upon which Louisiana may lay the privilege tax, that is local activity sufficiently separate from the flow of interstate commerce to permit that tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="866.558" offset="3569560">They pick up oil from a city service refinery in Lake Charles, Louisiana and they transport that further to the east outside the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.876" offset="3618879">They delivery refined products to a station in Baton Rouge from a refinery in Texas but there are no movements of its products from a point in Louisiana to another point in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.992" offset="3687320">All of the movements of its products are how will they may come, either come out in the state into Louisiana or from Louisiana out of the state and in the majority of the instances is primarily a matter of simply moving the oil or refined petroleum products through the pipeline that travels to the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.150" offset="3771956">So I say to the Court that there are no local activities separate from the interstate movement in Louisiana and under the circumstances, if we hold that this tax can be validly levied upon Colonial.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.960" offset="3859205">And I say to the Court, contrary to prior decisions of this Court in cases such as Spector Motors that we have now granted the state the authority to levy a tax upon the privilege of doing purely interstate business contrary to what I believe where the concept behind the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.398" offset="3957008">Now, let me make several further points with respect to the facts so that the Court will appreciate and I'm quoting the background of the statute, the Louisiana statute puts this matter in sharp focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.322" offset="4036629">Prior to 1970, the Louisiana tax was interpreted as being imposed upon the privilege of doing business and the same Colonial Pipeline Company litigated in the Louisiana Court the question of whether or not that tax so imposed violated the Commerce Clause in United States Constitution and the Louisiana courts held citing the Spector Motor case that the tax as applied to this purely intrastate operation violated the Commerce Clause and the Louisiana courts ordered a refund of the taxes which Colonial had paid in the protest in connection with the levy of the privilege statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.049" offset="4223561">Louisiana in 1970, made some revisions in the franchise tax so as to include what they call alternating incidents or alternative incidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.645" offset="4273925">Which in reality were nothing more than a restatement of what constituted doing business and the tax was paid under protest again and Colonial took the position that there had been no substantive change in the operating incidents of the tax and under those circumstances, the first Colonial case which have been decided by the Louisiana Court was dispositive of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.017" offset="4375489">The Louisiana District Court and the Louisiana Court of Appeals agreed and when the case went to the Louisiana Supreme Court under writs, the Louisiana Supreme Court took the position that in reality there was no substantive change in the statute that the tax even before the 1970 was not imposed upon the privilege of doing business but was imposed upon the doing of business in corporate form and then took the position that that doing of business in corporate form was a local activity upon which Louisiana could impose, place, levy this franchise tax without violation of the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.435" offset="4581125">I believe that this Court will read the statute before 1970 and after 1970, it will come to the conclusion as did the lower courts in Louisiana and in fact the Louisiana Supreme Court that there was no change in the operating incidence of the tax because doing business in corporate form was a manner in which you carried out this interstate business of Colonial and under the circumstances, the cases were parallel cases and should have reached the similar result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.512" offset="4709439">Now, I suggest to the Court that there is no distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.325" offset="4732635">As a matter of fact, it seems to me that there is more threat to the Commerce Clause by saying that you can impose the tax upon the -- on doing interstate business in corporate form than otherwise because that is the traditional method in which interstate business is conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.171" offset="4808077">And under the circumstances, it appears to us that the case is in the same posture it was at the time of the first case but if we accept it as having some distinction by reason of the 1970 Amendment, I still say to the Court that this is a tax upon interstate commerce which this Court has recognized that beyond the bounds of the states with respect to the -- with respect to the Commerce Clause and under the certain statute that Louisiana Supreme Court ought to be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.962" offset="4939212">Now, the Louisiana Supreme Court that the operating incidents of the tax was and I quote, ?The local incidents tax is a form of doing business rather than the business done by that corporation and they emphasized it by saying that the thrust of the statute is the tax of doing business in Louisiana in corporate form and I don't believe that there is any distinction that makes the difference between a tax upon a privilege of doing business and the tax which imposes it upon the doing of business in corporate form.</text>

            <text syncTime="1284.954" offset="5243173">Well, it would depend I think on whether or not the Court could find from activities that the airline was conducting in the State of Louisiana that they were indeed engaged in local activities separate from that interstate operation which might then form the basis of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.489" offset="5309315">For example, if that airline was bringing materials into Baton Rouge, where it can maintain that warehouse and was there storing those materials for some peak of the time before it was delivered to its customers, then I would say that that constitutes an intrastate activity unrelated and unnecessary to carrying on the interstate business as they are and under the circumstances, the State of Louisiana would well have a basis for levying the tax upon the privilege of doing business based upon the imposition of it upon the local activity being conducted by that company, but where the sole and only activity done by the company in the State of Louisiana is that which relates to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.577" offset="5533654">I say to the Court that you have to come to a different conclusion, otherwise, the states then have the right to determine whether or not corporations engaged in interstate commerce can truly exist in the state's in which they operate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1401.825" offset="5710660">I don't think that the cases which came after make any change in the law so far as Spector is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.398" offset="5736991">For example, the first Railway Express case in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.725" offset="5758307">The Court reached the same, identical conclusion that it reached in Spector which was the way you had a tax imposed solely upon the privilege of doing interstate business it would violate it with the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.213" offset="5812224">Virginia then came back as the Court may recall in the second Railway case and provided that the tax was an in lieu tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.648" offset="5853915">In lieu of the ad valorem tax on intangibles and rolling stock of the way we express agency and under those circumstances, this Court characterized the Virginia tax in the second Railway case as being in a nature of an ad valorem tax which was acceptable under a long line of decisions that this Court had rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.898" offset="5942941">But I know of no case, I know of no case which has been decided by this Court and Spector the first Railway Express case are to the contrast which holds that the states have a right to levy a franchise or privilege tax upon a business that's engaged exclusively in interstate commerce and it seems to me that in logic and in good reason, that has to be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.308" offset="6060596">For example, in Spector and in the first Railway case, this Court established the rule which stated that the Commerce Clause prohibits a state franchise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.123" offset="6115871">The operating incidence of which falls upon the privilege of carrying on exclusively and I emphasize the word exclusively interstate transportation in and through the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.480" offset="6169266">Now, there -- if we now permit contrary to what Spector holds, the states to say that we now have the right to tax the very business means by which an interstate carrier operates, then it has the right to tax the existence of that business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.229" offset="6280338">And it has the right under those circumstances if we grant to the states the power to tax that business, going back over many years of history before this Court, the recognition and the power to tax includes the power to destroy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3680.907" offset="14826977">In that case, the incidence of the tax was not the corporation or the corporate form on doing business.</text>

            <text syncTime="3738.912" offset="15059048">I'd like to make several comments and one has to do with the argument of counsel concerning the fact that Colonial qualified to do business in the State of Louisiana, and he seems to place great emphasis on that fact even though the Louisiana Supreme Court did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.109" offset="15131773">The fact is and if the Court will look at exhibit B 6 in the appendix, you'll find that Colonial qualified to do intrastate business in the State of Louisiana and if this Court will review the case of Ozark Pipeline Corporation versus Monier, which is a 266 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.007" offset="15211395">The Court will find there the question being weighed concerning the qualification of an interstate carrier in the state at issue there and the Court held that it was a question of qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.932" offset="15267088">But a question of what is done pursuant to that qualification and where in the Monier case, nothing had done other than interstate commerce, the Court held that the mere qualification had no bearing nor created any right in the state to impose a tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="3816.648" offset="15370010">If you -- the only basis upon which you could levy the tax, if it please the Court, is on the basis of some intrastate activity and under those circumstances, if no intrastate activity is engaged in, it does become important.</text>
