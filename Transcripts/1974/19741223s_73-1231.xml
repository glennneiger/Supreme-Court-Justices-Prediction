            <text syncTime="13.916" offset="55589">These cases involve a question of elections under the National Labor Relations Act of when -- who has the obligation of going forward after an impasse has been reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.650" offset="146599">In this case, the employer was not guilty of any unfair labor practice, entered into no agreement to settle it by means other than the election conducted by the board and there was a dispute as to whether or not the union represented the employees that it purported to represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.878" offset="259448">We conclude that within the statutory system as we read it, at that junction the duty was on the labor union to ask for the board's action to invoke the power of the board to conduct an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.039" offset="348056">Our reasons are elaborated in an opinion filed with the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.481" offset="365923">Mr. Justice Stewart has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice White, Mr. Justice Marshall, and Mr. Justice Powell joined.</text>
