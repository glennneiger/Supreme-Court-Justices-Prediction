            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear arguments first this morning in 74-124, Blue Chip Stamps and others against Manor Drug Stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.675" offset="146056">Mr. Kreps, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="allyn_o_kreps" startTime="18.040" stopTime="858.207">
            <label>Mr. Allyn O. Kreps</label>
            <text syncTime="18.040" offset="175522">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.554" offset="193599">The important practical question before this Court is whether every security issue subject to the security laws will be the basis for a federal claim for damages by any person whenever the issue price or current market price is followed by a price rise or more directly whether any non purchaser, non seller or potential investor will have a private federal claim to speculate on the market without cost or risk of loss and at the expense of actual and existing investors and to the burden of the federal judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.726" offset="398294">This statement may seem extreme and certainly simplistic but it is the inevitable practical result of the extreme and simplistic position taken by the Securities and Exchange Commission in this case by calling for the complete judicial abandonment of the purchaser-seller rule commonly known as the Birnbaum Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.804" offset="518562">The fundamental legal issue before this Court upon which this practical problem is bottomed is to determine what class of persons should be permitted to bring a judicially implied private right of action for damages under Rule 10b-5 as promulgated by the SEC to enforce the prohibitions of Section 10 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.334" offset="660668">Although no private right of action is set forth expressly in either Section 10 (b) by Congress or Rule 10b-5 of the SEC, the lower courts have implied such a right of action for purchasers or sellers since the Kardon case in 1946 and the Fischman case in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.275" offset="764426">This Honorable Court has recognized this implied right of action for damages inter alia in both Bankers Life and Affiliated Ute, although the existence of the right of action in the plaintiffs there involved or the plaintiff's standing in the non-constitutional sense was not questioned or an issue in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.611" offset="869857">The standing of the plaintiff-respondent here is in question precisely because it has never owned, never purchased or never sold the securities upon which it purports to base its alleged private claim for damages under Rule 10b-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.939" offset="975078">Now, petitioners concede that a violation of Rule 10b-5 in connection with the issuance of these securities has been alleged in the amended complaint but petitioners contend that as a matter or law, plaintiff-respondent has no judicially implied private right of action for damages arising from the issuance of these securities precisely because any such alleged damage was not incurred by the respondent in connection with either the purchase or sale of any security by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.909" offset="1174967">There being no better point of departure in determining the merits of this contention than Rule 10b-5 itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.133" offset="1211956">It should be observed that the express prohibitions of 10b-5 are applicable “in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.”</text>
            <text syncTime="291.618" offset="1269844">In the Birnbaum case, the Second Circuit concluded that the Rule 10b-5 did not create an implied private right of action for non-purchasers or non-sellers or potential investors but only for the defrauded purchaser or seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.351" offset="1348733">In subsequent cases, the lower courts have recognized the salutary regulatory purpose of Rule 10b-5 and have applied a liberal definition to the words purchase or sale to imply a private right of action for damages in the so-called for seller situation without requiring a formal consummated transaction and the lower courts also have recognized that the 1934 Act expressly defines sale or purchase to include contracts for which consideration has been given to sell or purchase and have recognized an implied right of action for damages under 10b-5 in such situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.999" offset="1571401">That is not the case here because there was no legally enforceable obligation to buy or to sell and no contractual relationship existed between respondent and petitioners or any of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.553" offset="1653635">Although the Birnbaum rule has been the subject of some academic criticism, this judicially developed doctrine has resulted in a rational and predictable framework for vindication of the policies underlying Rule 10b-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.070" offset="1731688">Even while the SEC urges the abandonment of the purchaser-seller rule, it now for the first time after many years recognizes or admits to the practical detrimental consequences of increase liability exposure, strike suits, news and settlement and an impossible standard of draftsmanship imposed upon the draftsman of the prospectus if the purchaser-seller rule is not retained.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.113" offset="1867839">Nonetheless, the SEC advocates that the rule be abandoned so that any person making an investment decision even when not to buy, not to do anything has a private right of action under 10b-5, and so proposing this subjective standard for standing, even the SEC attempts to ameliorate the recognize detrimental consequences upon all issuers of stock and their existing shareholders by suggesting two limitations but each limitation is illusory and ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.465" offset="2049233">The SEC proposes first an enhanced burden of proof upon plaintiff, potential investors and non-purchasers who claimed they would have bought or sold but for the alleged 10b-5 violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.514" offset="2117465">Whatever slight burden this may place on the scale pleaders in drafting complaints, it is clear that it does not provide any means of permitting summary disposition of cases before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.544" offset="2189563">Any recipient of a prospectus, anyone with notice of a stock issue or a recipient of a press release as in Texas Gulf Sulphur could subsequently bring a claim as to any stock having a post issue or market price rise by simply alleging receipt of the allegedly defective prospectus or the press release the fact of subsequent price increase and the obvious conclusion that he would have bought at the issue price or then market price if he had been informed correctly that the stock was a bargain or would increase in value.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.240" offset="2380361">Hindsight will invariably disclose some statement in a prospectus that appears to be either overemphasized as alleged here or underemphasized in the light of a subsequent price rise.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.052" offset="2443577">In this case, respondent watched the market price rise for over two years before filing the instant lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.294" offset="2488508">In the face of the expressed statutory mandate of the 1933 Act and as reflected by rules and policies of the SEC, that all prospectuses embody a conservative philosophy.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.836" offset="2554755">It is apparent that such factual situations of price rise will occur not infrequently but the SEC offers the issuer no rational means of complying with the conservative disclosure standards of the 1933 Act and yet avoiding the inevitable line of potential investor claimants at the federal court house.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.037" offset="2667499">The second limitation by the SEC is to impose vicarious liability upon the corporation only when it benefits from the alleged violation of Rule 10b-5 by its officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.213" offset="2732178">Presumably, this limitation is a recognition by the SEC that the purposes of the securities laws are not served by forcing corporation -- corporations to pay potential investors and non-purchasers from proceeds derived from actual purchasers and actual investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.692" offset="2834160">This second limitation is also illusory since motive is not an element of a 10b-5 claim and Section 20 (a) of the 1934 Act expressly imposes such vicarious liability upon the corporation for such acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.434" offset="2917125">Thus, however meritorious, such a limitation on vicarious liability might be, Congress has not seen fit to impose it and accordingly, judicial imposition would be inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.885" offset="2982954">But more fundamentally, the position of the SEC totally ignores the problem of what the substantive elements of a private claim by non-purchasers and potential investors would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.932" offset="3055052">For example, how many potential investors and non-purchasers can sue if one million shares are issued and so the $10.00 per share or $10 million to 1,000 persons, can everyone sue who received a prospectus or had knowledge of the issue but decided not to invest.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.970" offset="3159228">If a thousand additional potential investors did so, 10,000 and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.914" offset="3187022">At least under the present rule, the liability is limited to those one million shares, the money damages to a maximum of $10 million since that was the total price received and the suit is limited to purchasers, only they would be able to sue for the amount paid and that assumes the diminution of the value of the stock to zero and the number of potential plaintiffs is limited to 1,000, the actual number who purchased the shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.270" offset="3328502">Under the SEC proposal, the number of potential investors and non-purchasers and thus potential plaintiffs is totally unknown and only limited to those who saw or alleged they saw the prospectus notice or news release involved and the amount of potential liability is not 10 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.429" offset="3441037">It is also unknown and without limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.451" offset="3457128">Stocks have been known to increase many times over issue price and they are innumerable post issuance opportunities to be an alleged potential investor.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.197" offset="3504149">Stocks are sold and resold after initial issuance and there is no limitation under the SEC proposal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1297.126" offset="5291865">I would like to return briefly to one more example of the dangers of the rule advocated by the SEC to extend this private implied right of damages to potential investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.930" offset="5363127">Consider the potential investor who has only $1,000 to invest and consider stocks A, B, and C but buys only A, does he have a claim for -- excuse me -- a price rise of B and C?</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.745" offset="5430314">What if stock A rises more than B and C?</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.765" offset="5446405">Or less than B but more than C?</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.158" offset="5459989">Then if you multiply this -- the number of stocks A, B, and C by the number of different stocks traded or issued each year and have this investor with only a thousand dollars to invest, how many lawsuits does he have?</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.412" offset="5524982">Or in fact, does this potential investor even have to invest in any stock at all but simply use the thousand dollars for an alternative investment and play the market without cost or risk of lost and what if the alternative investment rises more than stock A, B, or C, has he been damaged no matter how fraudulent the prospectus discouraging him to purchase stock A, B, or C?</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.776" offset="5650474">And one final problem, one of the tremendous burden on the federal courts to be forced to litigate the potential merits of all those potential investor claims brought as questionable class actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.963" offset="5719228">All claims seeking speculative lost profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.755" offset="5742425">The purchaser-seller rule as developed and refined over the past quarter century accomplishes the salutary purpose of establishing rational and predictable requirements of standing for the proper vindication of Rule 10b-5 claims with probable merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.043" offset="5827584">In aggravated cases of alleged actual fraud such as claimed in one count here, potential investors and non-purchasers have an appropriate common law remedy in state court, just as respondent is pursuing in the California State Court, but the purposes and policies of the federal security laws are not served and cannot be reconciled by allowing any and all non-purchasers and potential investors to speculate on the market without cost or risk of loss and at the expense of that security's market actual investors in a federal court system already overburdened with litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.742" offset="6034369">Accordingly, standing under 10b-5 should not be extended judicially to such potential investors and non-purchasers as responded in the instant case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1519.848" offset="6182745">I feel constrained to comment upon two of the arguments just made by Mr. Kreps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.221" offset="6212211">One is in response to a question by the Court whether or not the Ninth Circuit in this case has abandoned the Birnbaum rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.329" offset="6248678">In the Mount Clemens case which involved the situation where there was a public auction of securities, the plaintiffs in that action brought a 10b-5 action on the grounds that they had been defrauded from making a bid at that auction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.198" offset="6320149">They were not offerees such as we are in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.476" offset="6337285">They had no transactional or causal nexus with the party selling the shares so that the Ninth Circuit in Mount Clemens found that there was no standing under 10b.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.834" offset="6386709">I feel by that, they did adopt the -- a portion at least of the Birnbaum rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.938" offset="6415130">Another argument that counsel has made concerns the unknown quantity of claimants that may arise if the example of an offering of a million shares and there may be 50 million people that will come later when the stock goes up and say, gee, I would have bought that stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.506" offset="6493393">That is not the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.029" offset="6503528">Here, we have an exact amount of shares offered to an exact amount of offerees at an exact price.</text>

            <text syncTime="2935.328" offset="11844733">There are various distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.444" offset="11853197">I think there are many cases where the lower courts have talked in terms of the Birnbaum rule because other Circuits had mentioned it but that there were other reasons they could have held that the plaintiff had no action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.164" offset="11915995">For example, one of the cases cited is someone against Wolfson, I can't think of the name of it at the moment but what was charged in that case was that the officers of the company had manipulated the securities and then bought some of the company's securities at a low price and subsequently manipulated it some more and sold back to the company at the higher manipulated price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.721" offset="12042219">Now, the action was brought by a stockholder of the company, not as a derivative action and the Court said, well, under the Birnbaum rule, you're not a plaintiff -- a purchaser or seller, you're just a stockholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.864" offset="12094777">On the other hand, had they brought it as a derivative action, the company was certainly a purchaser or seller and I certainly don't suggest that the plaintiff in that type of situation should necessarily have a cause of action, his injury was indirect through his corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.207" offset="12172204">On the other hand, I think that case illustrates had the plaintiff because the market was low and had been so manipulated sold his stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.776" offset="12218493">He would presumably have a cause of action under the Birnbaum rule, he would be a seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.686" offset="12238137">So, that is why I am saying that it is an arbitrary rule and I guess you're correct that it's an artificial rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3395.546" offset="13685530">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.935" offset="13703084">With respect to the question of whether Birnbaum is actually an issue in this case and in further response to the question of Mr. Justice Blackmun, the motion to dismiss in the District Court was expressly made on the ground of the Birnbaum rule and the memorandum opinion of the District Court squarely substantiated the dismissal of the complaint on the Birnbaum rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.117" offset="13815829">With respect to whether Birnbaum is an issue here and there is inconsistency in the Circuits, we again submit that there is an inconsistency in the Ninth Circuit between Mount Clemens and the majority of the panel below and Judge Hufstedler in her dissenting opinion on page 143 of our appendix says flatly, “the result reached by the majority is inconsistent with the holding and reasoning of this Court's recent decision in Mount Clemens Industries, Inc. versus Bell” and we think that the reason the majority found it necessary to adopt this exceptionally fussy equivalent function analysis was that there as now conceded by respondent no contractual right under the consent decree and merely what the functional equivalent language says is that we in essence are finding these people third party beneficiaries of a contract or consent decree and the obvious danger of that reasoning is that every stock issue has an underwriting contract and if you apply that reasoning, you could find every underwriting contract between the issuer and the underwriting -- underwriter and the subsequent brokers as a contract made for the ultimate benefit of the potential purchasers and then you do genuinely get into the parade of true horribles which I indicated in my opening argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.024" offset="14219473">The only explanation we have for the panel below the majority going arise as much as it did is the hard facts alleged in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.491" offset="14265344">But if there is any merit to those hard facts, they may be vindicated in the state court action which is currently pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.814" offset="14302647">One last point and that is with respect to Mr. Justice Brennan's question on the Eason case in the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.168" offset="14340054">Should the purchaser-seller rule be abandoned or bent in any manner as the Eason case -- Eason court favored?</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.653" offset="14381955">It should be noted that in the Eason case, the plaintiffs there in the words of the Court suffered “as investors and as principals in the transaction” and they were shareholders in the corporation that sold stock for certain assets and then they executed a personal guarantee of the liabilities of the -- of the acquired -- on the acquired assets to someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.773" offset="14502431">They certainly could have brought an action, derivative action on behalf of their own corporation as a result of the purchase or sale and I think the language that Eason court indicates that they actually were principals involved so that may not even be a purchased departure from the purchase-seller rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.934" offset="14579127">In any event, it would not be a sufficient departure to encompass the respondent in this case because everyone concedes that they are not purchasers, not sellers, not investors and have never expended one dime, they are only seeking.</text>
