            <text syncTime="74.847" offset="402787">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.658" offset="418043">These cases are here on direct appeal from the judgment of the three-judge court in the District of Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.915" offset="451062">The cases involved the relationship between the aid to families with dependent children or AFDC, unemployed father program and unemployment compensation benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.079" offset="507695">The principal statute involved is Section 607(c)(2)(ii) which I shall refer to an argument as the mandatory bar and that provision appears on page 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.049" offset="575613">As this Court knows, the AFDC program is a program of cooperative federalism funded by the system of matching state and federal grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.764" offset="618454">The federal statute sets out certain conditions that state plans must satisfy in order to receive federal funding and the mandatory bar provision provides that state plans must provide for the denial of AFDC benefits with respect to any week for which such child's father receives unemployment compensation under an unemployment compensation law of a state or the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.036" offset="743528">Now, the plaintiffs in this case were all families which were eligible for AFDC benefits but for the fact that in each case the unemployed receive unemployment compensation under state law and in each case, the amount of unemployment compensation received was considerably less than the AFDC benefits for which the family would have been eligible.</text>

            <text syncTime="196.173" offset="888038">As of this moment, we do know that Mr. Saracen who was an intervenor continues to be unemployed and continues to receive unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.595" offset="941746">At the bottom of page 6 of our brief, there is table which shows the differences in benefit levels and I want to call the Court's attention to the fact that there is one error in that table.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.227" offset="1000260">The Derosia family was eligible for $394.00 a month in AFDC and rather than $56.00 in unemployment compensation, that figure should be $224.00.</text>

            <text syncTime="259.574" offset="1141635">Now, we can't assume that this table is necessarily representative for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.601" offset="1177788">First of all, of course, AFDC benefits depend on a number of variables, the extent of other resources available to the family and primarily on a number of dependents.</text>

            <text syncTime="321.804" offset="1390634">However, there is one additional factor and that is that Vermont like most states has a general assistance program and the record does not show the extended benefits that were received in this case but we do know that at least the Percy family received general assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.121" offset="1467852">As I understand the Vermont General Assistance Program, it is basically an item by item need program.</text>

            <text syncTime="481.636" offset="2029902">Well, Mr. Justice Blackmun, I'm not sure -- we do know that in 1960 -- let me -- perhaps if I just went into briefly the history of the Unemployed Father Program, we can see how this provision came into the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.278" offset="2084446">Up until 1961, AFDC did not extend to families with an unemployed father and in that year it was so extended on an experimental basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.126" offset="2127914">Now, at that time, the law provided that states had an option.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.242" offset="2144319">They could deny AFDC if the father received unemployment compensation or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.321" offset="2172635">Some states did deny, I think only three, the other states supplemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.198" offset="2196146">Now, in 67, 68, when the Unemployed Father Program was made permanent, the Senate wanted to continue that optional system but the House Bill provided for the mandatory bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.693" offset="2250167">The difficulty with giving fathers an option is really threefold.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.163" offset="2272005">First of all, it makes the mandatory bar a nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.911" offset="2287052">There's simply be no reason to have a provision requiring a termination if it could be circumvented by an option.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.953" offset="2319235">And secondly, it operates on an assumption that Congress wanted to encourage the unemployed to turn down unemployment benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.451" offset="2353194">And finally, in operation, it shifts significant costs from the Unemployment Compensation Program that is funded by private employers to AFDC which is of course funded by State of Internal Revenues.</text>

            <text syncTime="885.350" offset="3644792">There is sufficient material in the record to consider the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.892" offset="3666944">And as to the constitutional claim, appellees' claim is basically that the mandatory bar operates to exclude children solely on the ground that their father receives unemployment compensation even though they maybe in need.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.638" offset="3741968">And it does operate that way but implicit in appellees' claim is the assumption that the AFDC program is in fact the comprehensive public assistance program or that it is constitutionally required to be and we think either assumption is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.446" offset="3813125">Need is -- the primary goal of the AFDC Program but Congress is operating within a framework of the limited amount of funds and given that context, it has chosen to provide assistance to those who are least able to change their circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.174" offset="3896090">And father's unemployment compensation maybe less than AFDC benefits but it maybe supplemented by general assistance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1059.725" offset="4342262">My name is David Kalib and I represent appellant Philbrook and the State of Vermont in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.981" offset="4367339">Vermont's position is that an unemployed father is excluded from receiving public assistance benefits under the unemployed father segment of the AFDC program if he's either eligible to receive or is currently receiving unemployment compensation benefits and this position is primarily based upon our understanding of congressional intent that was incorporated into the January 1968 Amendments for the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.433" offset="4509132">The House Ways and Means Committee in 1967 considered a vast number of amendments to that Act and they expressed an intent in their committee report to cut federal spending by reducing the public assistance roles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.499" offset="4585409">In addition for cutting the federal spending, they wish to get public assistance recipients back into the way before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.361" offset="4628773">The 1967 House Senate Conference Committee also considered the same vast number of amendments for the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.314" offset="4676629">They looked at two versions of how to treat unemployment compensation in relationship to public assistance benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.350" offset="4716753">First, there was a Senate version which retains the option of allowing states to supplement unemployment compensation benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.672" offset="4758026">The House version on the other hand denied assistance to any unemployed father who was receiving unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.461" offset="4797210">This House Senate Conference Committee recommended to the Congress the adoption of the version formulated by the House Ways and Means Committee namely the version that denied benefits to any unemployed father who was receiving unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.023" offset="4875473">Thus, it's pretty clear the intent of Congress was to enact the version to reduce federal spending and at the same time cute the welfare roles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.920" offset="4923016">And in addition, this Conference Committee Report recognized that the word “received” was either equivalent to or equated with the term qualified to receive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1238.825" offset="5058644">It would still go against the mandatory bar in Section 607 if you establish that and I think we'd be in trouble with federal matching funds in violation of the AFDC Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.839" offset="5122696">Since 1968, the Department of Health Education Welfare along with the State of Vermont and then I cannot speak for any other states but on the best information I have, they've all been interpreting this congressional intent to exclude a father who has not developed and exhausted his unemployment compensation benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.822" offset="5222693">In other words, if he is eligible for those unemployment compensation benefits, he must go there first and exhaust those benefits prior to any application for public assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.003" offset="5275355">The District Court decision which formulated an option plan of allowing the recipient equally eligible for both programs to reject the lower benefit, I think in terms of the District Court's decision it was phrased that if his AFDC benefit is higher he can reject the unemployment compensation benefits and vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.407" offset="5377024">This goes against and completely contrary to the congressional intent of reducing federal spending.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.134" offset="5411924">It even goes beyond the Senate version of restoring the option of allowing states to supplement and the Senate version was ultimately rejected by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.310" offset="5460616">The District Court plan also establishes an either/or alternative and that is the unemployed father completely rejected his unemployment compensation and rely 100% on public assistance to meet the needs of his children and there is nothing that we can find in legislative intent to create that scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.347" offset="5576808">We think that Congress realized that this purpose, the mandatory bar provision could be accomplished by a joint reading of Section 402 and Section 407 of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.101" offset="5631770">Section 402 mandates each state to require each applicant for public assistance to develop, utilize and exhaust all his benefits, excuse me, all his income and resources that are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.427" offset="5705122">If we start with that premise and say that an individual who was eligible for unemployment compensation benefits must go down and develop and utilize those benefits and he does so, Section 407 of the Social Security Act precludes him from receipt of any public assistance benefits under the unemployed fathers section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.401" offset="5824972">In addition, adoption of the District Court option plan which shifts the burden of providing aid to children of unemployed fathers from the unemployment compensation insurance trust funds funded totally from the private sector namely the employers to the public treasury and increase the public assistance roles again contrary to Congress' intent back in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.396" offset="5964988">In effect, what the District Court option plan does is legislate an income floor for all unemployed fathers, and that income floor is based upon the state's standard of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.305" offset="6020577">Therefore, any unemployed father could forego these unemployment compensation benefits and get public assistance up to that state standard of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.460" offset="6069164">Historically, these programs have been treated as two separate and distinct programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.802" offset="6098631">Unemployment compensation has always been the first line of defense for a temporarily unemployed work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.511" offset="6141367">The system is back from the initial creation of the Act in 1935 and we think this is true today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.967" offset="6171251">We see just last year, the Federal Unemployment Act extended benefits for those unemployed who exhausted their normal state benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.477" offset="6217331">On the other hand, public assistance benefits have always been treated as a last resort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.815" offset="6246588">You rely on relief after you've exhausted everything else and I think this Court recognize these two principles in the Java case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.263" offset="6292459">As harsh as this all seems, particularly with respect to the plaintiffs in this case who have received a substantially less amount of money from unemployment compensation and they have from public -- would have from public assistance had they been eligible, Vermont has tried to mitigate or alleviate that that hardship to some extent and that is by supplementing unemployment compensation through its general assistance program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.599" offset="6425788">Now, I have to admit, however, that the supplement is not necessarily going to be equal to the difference between the unemployment compensation benefit and the state's standard of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.363" offset="6488795">This depends on a host of factors, one being the individual's income within the prior calendar period and other being is need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.980" offset="6531323">The state program is entirely state funded, it's based upon an emergency grant provision and the individual applicant must have no other resources available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.296" offset="6584508">If he does have resources available, he has to exhaust those other resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.181" offset="6612093">So, in some cases, the individual get nothing from general assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.318" offset="6632678">In some cases they'll get an amount which his total income will be less than the state's standard of need and in other cases, he could conceivably get a grant which would make his total income exceed the state's standard of need for a 30-day period but it is available to that applicant.</text>
