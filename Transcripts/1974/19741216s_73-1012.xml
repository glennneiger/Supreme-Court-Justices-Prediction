            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="11.046" offset="44095">This is a private anti-trust case that comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.468" offset="69799">The respondents who were the complainants were below are in the business of making asphaltic concrete.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.584" offset="98325">This product used for servicing highways must be delivered within a radius of some 35 miles from the “hot plants” that make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.291" offset="141061">The defendants in the suit included oil companies which provide the liquid petroleum ingredient for the asphalt and two of their subsidiaries which compete with complainants.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.331" offset="193306">All sales involved in this case were made exclusively intrastate in the Los Angeles area.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.893" offset="227474">But a portion of the asphaltic concrete was used to construct local segments of interstate highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.092" offset="264359">The plaintiffs allege various violations of the Robinson-Patman and Clayton Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.281" offset="289123">The question that comes to us in view of the local nature of the asphaltic concrete market is whether these Acts are applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.989" offset="331860">The complainants contend that they are since the asphalt goes into interstate highways that are instrumentalities of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.837" offset="375327">This view was sustained by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.771" offset="391001">We however take a different view.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.095" offset="408346">The language of Robinson-Patman and the Clayton Acts is not as expansive as that of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.618" offset="438439">The Acts here involve apply to forbidden transactions in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.432" offset="465711">We hold first that use in interstate highways is not enough to place these transactions in commerce as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.823" offset="515239">Nor do we think these transactions come within these Acts simply because they may affect commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.282" offset="549094">The language and legislative history of the Robinson-Patman Act do not support and effects on commerce theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.247" offset="588904">And as to the Clayton Act provisions, there are no showings that the alleged restraints had any effect on commerce in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.536" offset="634044">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.316" offset="653166">Mr. Justice Marshall filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.384" offset="669466">Mr. Justice Douglas filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Brennan joined.</text>
