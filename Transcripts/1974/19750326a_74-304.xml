            <text syncTime="22.573" offset="193703">First, Mr. Justice Stewart asked the question of the petitioner with respect to the legislative history of the Exchange Act, in a particular, a draft which utilized the word uniform, uniform rights and that matter is laid out at pages 20 and 21 of SEC's brief, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.902" offset="287013">Secondly, it has been suggested that perhaps I misunderstood a question of Mr. Justice White with regard to the antitrust situation if fixed rates are abolished on May 1st in accordance with the SEC's directive.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.257" offset="352423">I understood the question to relate to exchanges and I answered that there would be no antitrust liability, obviously, they would not be fixing rates anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.800" offset="390562">But if Your Honors question related to the situation of brokers, members of exchanges, I'd like to make it clear that at least in my view, there is no question that Merrill-Lynch and Bache or other firms got together and fixed the rates between them, they would be subject to the full range of antitrust liabilities and penalties.</text>

            <label>Mr. William Eldred Jackson</label>
            <text syncTime="259.277" offset="1140485">Against members conspiring themselves to violate the antitrust laws after fixed rates, exchange fixed rates are over.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.362" offset="1184789">And I just want to make that clear because perhaps I haven't been clear yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.306" offset="1212583">If I may recapitulate, Your Honors, our position in this case which of course deals with past conduct is that the exchanges are entitled to an antitrust exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.125" offset="1267858">For this limited area of activity, the fixing of commission rates through implied repeal of the antitrust laws on the twin grounds of first, irreconcilability of the two statutory schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.010" offset="1319372">And secondly, because the jurisdiction of the District Courts under the antitrust laws would create a conflict with SEC jurisdiction and would prevent the functioning of the Exchange Act and this presents the different case which this Court reserved in Silver.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.121" offset="1395858">Now, Mr. Shapiro yesterday afternoon if I understood him correctly suggested that there might be various degrees of exemption including the concurrent jurisdiction of the courts in the SEC, depending on the type of procedure utilized by the SEC whether it was action or inaction or a formal order or whatnot and it seemed to me that this argument dealt rather much on form over substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.397" offset="1512991">But in any event, I would suggest that the argument derives no support from either Section 19 (b) of the Exchange Act and certainly not from the implied repeal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.085" offset="1559698">Because either the Exchange Act creates an implied exemption or it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.696" offset="1582164">I failed to see any room for shades of gray in a matter of that area and it seems to me that certainly the exchanges of this country are entitled to know with some certainty what conduct on their part is lawful and what is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.858" offset="1646843">Mr. Shapiro also argued if I understood him correctly that there could be no repugnancy in this situation and therefore no exemption until and unless the SEC actually issued a formal order to the exchange to fix commission rates and this is a mirror image, I believe of the what I regard as a concession in the Department of Justice's brief at page 48 that if there were a formal order by the SEC to the exchanges to fix rates, no antitrust liability could arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.632" offset="1817893">Now, by limiting this concession to a formal order, I would submit that the argument fails to recognize the unique statutory scheme of the Exchange Act and of Section 19 (b) which does not provide for a direct SEC regulation by a formal order.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.534" offset="1901484">It is not a public utility type regulatory statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.534" offset="1921546">It has provided for a system of exchange self-regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.754" offset="1946415">The exchanges first themselves on their own initiative adopt rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.585" offset="1969716">The SEC has the power if it deems those rules objectionable in the light of the statutory standards to first to request an exchange to change them and if the exchange does so, that's the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.206" offset="2036172">If the exchange refuses the request, then and only then does the SEC have to proceed by a formal hearing and an order or a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.338" offset="2088730">So that the argument which Mr. Shapiro made, it seems to me would in essence re-write Section 19 (b) of the Exchange Act by requiring an order whereas the Act itself indicates that request by the SEC in compliance by the exchange are sufficient to achieve the statutory objectives without a hearing and without an order.</text>

            <text syncTime="798.450" offset="3297155">In this case, the structure of the statute is such that no affirmative action is required in order for the exchange rules on whatever subject to become effective.</text>

            <text syncTime="939.415" offset="3860982">In fact, going as far back as 1941 in the multiple trading case where they brought a proceeding against the exchange on anticompetitive grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.191" offset="3900165">Those factors have been considered and as I said yesterday, they have been considered with the active assistance of the Department of Justice which is intervened in the hearings which the SEC has held under subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.618" offset="3957844">Now, I would submit Your Honors that the argument of Mr. Shapiro means that if there can be exemption only where there's an order there is no exemption and this would repeal the doctrine of implied repeal and would result in endless litigation rather than regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1015.698" offset="4166196">The first point is what is the regulatory scheme of the Exchange Act and how did Congress deal with the question of fixed commission rates in that scheme?</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.518" offset="4209455">The second is how does that regulatory scheme actually work at the SEC and what has the SEC been doing for the last 41 years in dealing with the question of fixed rates?</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.835" offset="4262745">And third, why to use this Court's expression, we believe a plain repugnancy exists between two regulatory regimes and why the regulatory scheme of the Exchange Act simply will not work as Congress intended it if antitrust courts are given the opportunity to substitute their judgments for the reason to regulatory judgment of the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="1092.698" offset="4474128">The public interest standards of the Act and we do consider competitive considerations but we also consider other economic considerations, regulatory considerations and the other considerations under the Act and then take action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1122.725" offset="4594291">The Congress gave the Commission specific authority under the 34 Act to do several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.729" offset="4626265">It gave it specific authority to adopt rules, mandatory rules concerning financial responsibility, concerning borrowing practices, concerning manipulative and deceptive practices and concerning practically every other important thing in dealing with investor protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.863" offset="4694810">And the Congress also gave the SEC authority to register stock exchanges, to police stock exchanges and to require amendments to their Constitution and by-laws as the commission determines necessary in the interest of investor protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.508" offset="4753429">Now, at Section 19 (b), Congress gave the Commission jurisdiction to supervise rules and required changes in exchange by-laws and rules and regulations in such matters as 12 enumerated categories in similar matters including specifically the authority to regulate the fixing of fixed commission by exchanges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.125" offset="4851858">And that subject to fixed commissions by exchanges had been 142 years old in 1934 when Congress addressed itself to this issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1202.552" offset="4913612">Congress chose to regulate the practice by subjecting it to the jurisdiction of its new federal agency like so many other things it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.741" offset="4958333">Now, in the Act, Congress gave the Commission a variety of regulatory tools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.629" offset="4981844">It gave the Commission authority to adopt rules and impose them upon the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.247" offset="5004309">It gave the Commission authority to conduct investigations, hold hearings and make recommendations to the industry and expect them to follow the recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.589" offset="5041716">It gave it authority to supervise these rules and to require changes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1245.780" offset="5086542">And lastly, it gave it the ultimate club by giving the Commission authority to withdraw or suspend the registration of an exchange for failure to follow the commission rule, order or regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.311" offset="5136593">That is the regulatory scheme we're talking about today and it is the regulatory scheme that Mr. Justice Blackmun analyzed in the Ware case just 15 months ago in talking about the kinds of direct supervisory authority the SEC had and then other areas like Ware, like Silver but in that case analyzed that there should be a repealer when we are talking about an area over which the Commission has direct supervisory jurisdiction which we think is this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.509" offset="5257383">Now, yesterday, a question was asked by Mr. Justice White about the Commission's authority to take action against a member of an exchange for violating an exchange rule and that -- and the question to that -- and the answer to that question is that there are four parts to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.829" offset="5334706">The Commission does have authority to take action directly against a member if the member violates the Exchange Act or an SEC rule or regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.125" offset="5371904">It doesn't specifically refer to exchange rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.251" offset="5384338">The SEC does have specific power under Section 15 (b) of the Exchange Act to revoke the authority of a member to do business in the security's industry if it violates certain conduct in that fashion but again it doesn't specifically refer to exchange rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.560" offset="5445569">Thirdly, if that conduct in violating an exchange rule, also violated another rule of the Commission or of the statute then the Commission has direct authority under Section 21 to bring an injunctive action against that member for violating a statute or a rule and regulation of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.935" offset="5523101">And then lastly, of course, the commission has the authority under 19 (a) (1) to withdraw the registration of that exchange for failure to comply, or forced compliance by its members of its own rules which the Commission did in 1966 revoke in the registration of San Francisco Mining Exchange for among other things just that, failing to require compliance by exchange members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.443" offset="5641174">The question was also asked yesterday and Mr. Jackson came back to it today and I think the Commission would like to make its position clear on the question of what happens after May 1, 1975 when we have said there shall be no practice of fixed rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1594.410" offset="6481063">They resulted in the introduction of a non-member discount in 1971, permitting persons who are not members of the exchange to get a 40% discount from the public rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.364" offset="6524844">The exchanges in that situation that come in with a rule proposing a 30% non-member discount and we said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.496" offset="6549400">It had to be 40% and the exchange adopted a 40% discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.435" offset="6565073">That's how this process works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.083" offset="6575731">These studies and these letters also resulted in the elimination of the give up practice in 1968 at the SEC insistence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.760" offset="6610422">These policies and these procedures resulted in the elimination of fixed rates for under $2,000.00 and for over $500,000.00 and then for over $300,000.00 all of which came at the insistence of the SEC through these informal procedures, 19 (b) letters if you will.</text>

            <text syncTime="1928.076" offset="7815711">I just wanted to conclude that part of my remarks by saying that in the PBW case in the Third Circuit 1973, in an independent broker-dealer case in 1971 in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, those two circuits analyzed exactly how this regulatory scheme works, talking about the jurisdiction, how this informal assortment of regulatory tools are intended to operate and both concluded that is the way the Exchange Act is intended to work and the agency should not be required to resort to formal hearings, mandates and orders unless the exchange refuses to cooperate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.346" offset="7972760">And that we believe is what happened in this case and that's what we have before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.019" offset="7995434">I'd also like to say that we believe that the record in this case is replete with example after example, of what the SEC has been doing in this situation and the Department of Justice's reply brief at page 6 which was filed on a Saturday but suggests that the SEC has done nothing with respect to the practice fixed commission rates until September 1973 but merely tolerated the practice is we believe shockingly disingenuous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.581" offset="8145690">The last point gets to the issue of plain repugnancy and as I've indicated, this Court had that question before it in Silver, and analyzed the commission's regulatory jurisdiction again more thoroughly in Ware where there, Mr. Justice Blackmun speaking for a unanimous court said that these kinds of measures and rules by exchanges authorized by the commission are designed to ensure fair dealing and to protect investors and are the kind directly related to the Act's purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.264" offset="8312456">And we believe that we are talking about it in essential ingredient in the Exchange Act in this case and in Silver which was a particular enforcement of an exchange rule, this Court spent five pages of its opinion reciting rule after rule after rule over the exchange everyone of which was anti-competitive and then said that those rules were designed to meet the standards of the Act but that there will be no repealer in that case because the SEC didn't have jurisdiction over the particular enforcement of that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.447" offset="8465115">But that a different case would be presented when this Court was faced with a rule over which the SEC does have jurisdiction and if there was ever a classic different case, we believe that this is that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2123.322" offset="8596668">Ricci involved a withdrawal of a membership on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and this Court's opinion said that there were facts that had to be resolved in that dispute, had Ricci voluntarily given up his membership?</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.512" offset="8653406">Did Segal have a lien of shares?</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.284" offset="8664482">Did Ricci owe Segal brokerage fees and was the withdrawal of the membership or the taking away of the membership consistent with a valid rule of the exchange?</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.743" offset="8702307">Said this is something that should be sent to the Commodity Exchange Authority for decision on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.847" offset="8730728">And after the facts are in, we will decide if there is an implied repealer because if the membership was taken away pursuant to an invalid rule or taken away improperly, then the implied repealer question goes away.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="i_walton_bader" startTime="2213.314" stopTime="2625.809">
            <label>Mr. I. Walton Bader</label>
            <text syncTime="2213.314" offset="8956635">May it please, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.184" offset="8964159">May I first point out to the Court that based upon everything that has been said here, it is my feeling and belief that in fact, the record in this case before this Court is completely inadequate to make a proper determination and I think that really what should be done in this case is to send this back to the District Court for a full and complete trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.297" offset="9060603">They could erase the question of the antitrust immunity involved, the position of the stock exchange, the position of the SEC are completely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.615" offset="9093831">Interestingly enough, Mr. Nerheim now tells me that if I started a District Court action against the SEC in connection with the stock exchange rules that that District Court action would not have been subject to a motion to dismiss but we did start such an action and with Civil Action 1984-71 of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and as pointed out on page 6 of my brief, the SEC did make a motion to dismiss on the ground that the District Court had no jurisdiction, that motion was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.396" offset="9208978">Now, perhaps the SEC has taken a different view at this point but I don't think that a plaintiff in this should have to come all the way up to the Supreme Court to obtain a change in the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.814" offset="9250670">The fact remains that the procedures that the SEC has for the review of their so-called non-objection to stock exchange rules are now, are basically not reviewable by any court and if you try the circuit court, you're dismissed on the ground that it's not an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.950" offset="9327156">If you tried at District Court, you're dismissed on the ground that there are other considerations involved which make that inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.763" offset="9350457">And I submit that without a consistent means for the public to proceed in any of these agency determinations that as a practical matter, such an agency determination could not repeal the antitrust laws and as matter of fact, there might be some serious due process violations involved as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.318" offset="9420675">Now, basically, as far as this Court has determined under the Silver case, it seems that the exemption in each case has to be considered under the facts that are involved in the particular case and under the facts that are involved in this particular case, I submit to the Court that if the record is considered by the Court to be complete that there is no such implied exemption of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.970" offset="9515238">I point out for example that let us assume that the stock exchange provided for a rule which similar to it, I believe Mr. Justice Stewart mentioned, that let us say the rule provided for a division of markets and we'll assume that the SEC does not object to that rule for one reason or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.756" offset="9606353">Is the position of the defendant now in this case that such a clear violation of the antitrust laws would now be insulated?</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.798" offset="9638536">Or let us go to something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.881" offset="9646895">Let us suppose that the SEC has a rule now abolishing fixed commission rates as they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.914" offset="9675003">Two exchange members get together now and go ahead and determine that they are going to fixed commission rates regardless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.114" offset="9707813">Mr. Nerheim has said and Mr. Jackson has said quite correctly that that would not be exempt from the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.634" offset="9733935">However, since this is now a violation of the SEC Act, we are now met with a situation where there are a number of cases holding that if you sue under antitrust counts for a violation of the anti -- of the SEC Act, that at that point, you're only entitled to single damages and not triple damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.710" offset="9806242">So that what I'm pointing out to the Court is that you're ending up into a plethora of problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.256" offset="9836440">The proper regulatory scheme as the plaintiff submits and I so believe justice submits is that any particular regulatory scheme which is tended to be a claim exemption from the antitrust laws must be considered in each individual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.134" offset="9911881">Now, what actually happens that in so far as fixed commission rights, there has been no significant agency action taken in this case except now after some 41 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.763" offset="9958379">Now, furthermore, the SEC grants any of their requests that it may -- of files a Rule 19 (b) request, there is no public participation in such request.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.601" offset="10017729">Now, to say that that can now be reviewed by a member of the public now coming in and bringing a suit in the District Court and getting into a full dress trial would belie the entire administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.211" offset="10072168">This means now that there is no way to come before the SEC first and say to the SEC gentlemen, this rule that is being proposed has serious anti-competitive effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.318" offset="10120652">The normal rule of exhaustion of administrative remedies, it would seem to me, would be completely violated by permitting such a procedure and since there is no mechanism for public participation in connection with such a rule, it seems to me that such a statutory scheme cannot be held to be regulatory authority and violated and not immune from the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.139" offset="10219917">As a matter of fact, this is precisely what ought to tell held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.456" offset="10237158">And it seems to me that this case is almost directly analogous to ought to tell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.812" offset="10278640">Also, I point out to the Court that there has been never any SEC order of any kind ordering any fixed commission rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.438" offset="10321168">The only SEC order that has been imposed, has been made has been the order now that fixed commission rates shall be phased out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.433" offset="10357112">Now, let us suppose that the SEC now determines after let us say the 1st of June and the 1st of July, that fixed unblocked rates have not worked out and the stock exchange now presents a proposal for fixed rates, the SEC now goes ahead and permits that fixed rate order to go in without any review, without any hearing, without anything of that sort going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.187" offset="10464110">Now, I as a member of the public do not have any right to make my views know to the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.530" offset="10489501">I must now go ahead to the District Court of the District of Columbia, bring an action with respect to this and I have the entire burden on myself of a full-dress trial with the SEC no longer in a position where I am attempting to convince a regulatory agency to take certain action but as an adversary to the regulatory agency and I submit that that is not the proper regulatory practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.121" offset="10595871">I thank the Court for its consideration.</text>
