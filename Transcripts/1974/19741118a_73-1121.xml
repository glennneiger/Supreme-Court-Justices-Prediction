            <text syncTime="51.863" offset="310836">The case presented to the Court today is a garnishment action involving Title 46, Section 101, that (Inaudible) of the code of Georgia, which provides for prejudgment garnishment by a plaintiff upon the defendant's bank account without notice to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.783" offset="374471">The authority for our position before this Court today is contained in this Court's decisions in Sniadach, Fuentes versus Shevin, and Mitchell versus W. T. Grant Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.902" offset="422954">We also consider the authority of Boddie versus Connecticut, at 401 US 371, to be especially applicable to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.034" offset="463496">And the facts are, that on August the 20, 1971, Di-Chem Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.993" offset="483349">filed a suit on account against North Georgia Finishing, and concurrently therewith, an intermediate sequential order, filed a garnishment action, and served its summons of garnishment upon the First National Bank of Dalton, in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.323" offset="544684">And the summons of garnishment, was issued by a clerk of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.323" offset="560671">It was based only upon the conclusory allegation, that the plaintiff had reason to apprehend the loss of a sum of money or a part thereof in the process of garnishment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.439" offset="613125">The summons required the garnishee to answer in not less than 30, no more than 45 days, all of the property that it had at the time service belonging to the defendant, and all of the property that might have come into his possession in the interim and this is not withstanding the fact that all of the property may have more or less than were as sued for, by the plaintiff in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="177.907" offset="815000">Now, the Georgia practice as stated in Powell versus Powell, at 95 Georgia Appeals 122 provides that a defendant in such a case is not even a party to the case, and is not entitled to any notice either pre-seizure or post-seizure, he is just not a party to the case, until he posts bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.843" offset="918758">In this case, North Georgia Finishing posted bond, as soon as the courthouse opened after the weekend was over, the garnishment was issued on Friday afternoon, and in doing so freeze its bank account.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lemuel Hugh Kemp</label>
            <text syncTime="1596.895" offset="6490990">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.797" offset="6498513">I will end when the clock sounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.789" offset="6506559">I have my family here and I have to take them back on a train tonight, but I think I can cover the essential points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.168" offset="6524008">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.667" offset="6534040">I will take up three points rely on my brief on my constitutionality of the Georgia statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.025" offset="6555460">The first is, as indicated by Mr. Justice Powell, we think that waiver rights, the garnishment issued, they file the bond, not to create a stand-in, but to free up this bank account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.464" offset="6605197">Three weeks later, as an after thought, after having read a little law perhaps, they came in and filed an assault and an under attack in paragraph 11, to answer to Mr. Justice Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.839" offset="6654725">Paragraph 3, said, if plaintiff had no reason to apprehend the loss of any judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.045" offset="6675519">Then three weeks, after they filed the bond, not to create stand-in but to free the bank account, they came in and had an opportunity to have a complete and a full hearing of any kind and at their instance it was heard and Judge (Inaudible) of superior court entered an order in which he denied each and every of the grounds on page 10 and 11 in the appendix of the North Georgia's brief.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.046" offset="6783561">So we say they waived any rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.530" offset="6793488">Secondly they had many other ways which could have attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.295" offset="6808534">The main action was removed to federal court, although they could have filed a separate suit in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.464" offset="6833194">They could have filed an inter-plea, they could have filed a declaratory judgment, they could raised it in many different issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.422" offset="6861093">The reason they filed the bond was to free the bank account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.047" offset="6879587">Our second point is that under the authority of DeFunis versus Odegaard, the issue is a moot, first because they filed the bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.893" offset="6914905">Once they filed the bond under Georgia law, Roberts versus (Inaudible) the dissolution bond takes the place of the property or the fund garnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.100" offset="6951790">There is no issue anymore, it's moot, just as when the law student graduated, the issue out of Washington and Oregon became mute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.696" offset="6990137">Secondly, and I don't want to get into an argument of counsel as to whether or not it's plant is solvent or not, but I respectfully submit and stating my place that what has happened is exactly what Mr. Foster said when he filled out this affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.547" offset="7049592">The defendants will not be forthcoming to answer the garnishment and we submit that if the Court does want to make an inquiry, it's not in the record, but the insolvency of the debtor if it in fact existed would make the garnishment moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.244" offset="7124302">Thirdly, and the third point is, we make the point in our brief that the Georgia statute and Your Honors, I frankly have inquired into the various areas of -- and I'll cover in my brief is constitutional and we distinguish, if we think (Inaudible) and (Inaudible) the Mitchell decision and the recent decision in the last week of the court, upon seizure of automobiles and similar recent cases which I don't have cited in my brief because it came down after the brief was typed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.970" offset="7263274">The main point I want to make otherwise is that even if this court should reach Mr. Coppedge's conclusion and assertion that the statute is unconstitutional required to provide notice that it should not be applied to retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.879" offset="7338924">This case was filed in August 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.140" offset="7351881">Sniadach had been decided, but it's certainly it didn't presage Fuentes, that was limited to specialized wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.312" offset="7388662">Fuentes had not been decided when the case would argued in the Trial Court in December 1971, and when Trial Court had issued its order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.344" offset="7428786">Under the case of Linkletter versus Walker cited in our case, another case was cited in our brief, this Court had held that it will not apply retroactively, so as to dislodge established reliance on a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.705" offset="7494196">Most recently in the case of Lemon versus Kurtzman which involved the Pennsylvania state, reimbursing sectarian schools, notwithstanding the fact that the statue had been declared unconstitutional, the Court refused to apply the statue or the unconstitutional holding that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.973" offset="7567235">In that case the Court stated statutory or even Judge made rules of law of hard facts on which people must rely in making decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.373" offset="7608822">This fact of legal life underpins our modern decisions recognizing a doctrine of non-retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.751" offset="7642363">So we say in this case, Your Honor, and respectfully submit, we don't think that the statute is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.541" offset="7665560">We don't think that you should ever reach the issue, because of waiver and because of mootness, but even if you do reach it and agree with counsel for petitioner, we respectfully submit Di-Chem is relying on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.956" offset="7719163">The only thing that they have got is this bond now, if they don't get into claim that there was no holding or poor shuddering of Fuentes, and therefore it would be inapplicable and under this Court's doctrine as stated in the Kurtzman case and in the Walker and Linkletter case that if the Court does reach a conclusion that the Georgia statute is unconstitutional for any reason whatever, that it should be given prospective application only and it should not be applied retroactively because what we're talking about is Di-Chem's right to get to stick to $51000 and I'm not sure that even the bond is solving it at this time because of various and sundry things that have gone in these corporations but at least we respectfully to submit that we should have our right to go after North Georgia and after his bondsman.</text>
