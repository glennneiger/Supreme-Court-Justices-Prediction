            <text syncTime="54.472" offset="322309">Mr. Rhyne, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles S. Rhyne</label>
            <text syncTime="57.036" offset="332549">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.761" offset="343416">The appellants here states and cities challenge the constitutionality of some 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which covered the -- all the remaining employees of states and cities under that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.400" offset="413947">The way it was done was by declaring all states and all cities to be commercial enterprises and under that enterprise interpretation to apply all of the regulations of the act to the states and cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.839" offset="487717">But first of all, I'd like to point out that this is not a minimum wage case.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.332" offset="509764">It isn't a case involving the low paid people.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.953" offset="528259">It's the application of this act to their relatively high paid people, the wiping out of state and local Government civil service laws, processes, procedures, the forced restructuring of the way that they will render far service for example, it is the -- which results in enormous increases in cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.933" offset="616135">These are the things that the states and the cities complain of and say to this Court that this act is really a very massive complex regulatory act which in affect reaches every employee, be he working in the executive, legislative, or judicial branches of state Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.276" offset="705473">Now, there are some exemptions for elected officials and their confidential age and for professional people.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.576" offset="730655">But, the interesting thing about the application of this act in the claim repeatedly that is to correct substandard labor conditions is that in the entire record made over three or four years in the Congress, the appellee's predecessors in the Department of Labor were only able to find they claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.367" offset="809859">95,000 people out of 11,400,000 who in 1973 they thought could be covered by this act, who where getting less than the minimum wage and we doubt frankly that figure because it shows here in the record that firefighters get $12,000.00 a year, the highly publicized New York garbage collectors and sweepers get $20,000.00 up to $24,500.00, and out in San Francisco, they get almost as much.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.304" offset="945591">So we're not talking about minimum wages, we're not talking about substandard conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.271" offset="973490">What we are talking about is a basic restructuring of Government in the United States of America, big change in our federal system of Government whereby for the first time, in all history, the federal Government is asserting power over every state, over every city and every employee they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.573" offset="1050708">There can be no question about that because as appellee admits, you have to keep a record for even the exempt people.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.180" offset="1073068">So this is a massive takeover, it's in the massive overlapping duplication, nullification of civil service, debt limit, tax limit, budget limit laws and it affects this vast change in power and we talked mostly about power.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.259" offset="1161467">Appellee talks about payroll cost and say they are nothing but we talk about power of Government and we say here that the federal Government is asserting jurisdiction for the first time over their most important element in every state and local budget for personnel cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.855" offset="1231788">Cities have 80% to 85% of their budget in personnel cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.529" offset="1258538">States, California has 76% and other states are similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.788" offset="1283511">So, we say that this act is a massive takeover of functions that had been performed on the local level since the founding of our nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.459" offset="1334188">I used one illustration of the wiping out of ballot box control.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.886" offset="1351952">In the record pages 4, 14 and following, there's a copy of the New Jersey statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.470" offset="1374312">That statute applies to the platoon system for fireman.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.092" offset="1388732">It says you have the fireman on 24 hours, off 24 hours, and they can work 56 hours a week, but only after that has been approved by referendum of the local voters and no one can look.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.433" offset="1442126">If the regulations were promulgated on the 20th of December 1974 by the wage in our administrator for the Secretary of Labor and not see that this New Jersey statute is wiped out completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.400" offset="1505970">And all across this nation from the New England town meetings to the referenda that they are so popular at West where they have a referenda almost on everything, every time we have had a fundamental increase in money or fundamental change in providing unique services uniquely needed by a particular city or state because of geography and other reasons, there's always the possibility new other people voting on it as they did in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.867" offset="1623834">But under this act and under the actions of the appellee that ballot box control is gone forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.905" offset="1652046">Now, this act as I say is a massive imposition down at top of massive legislation that's already in effect, affecting states and cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.832" offset="1691752">This is where they spend most of their money.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.202" offset="1709202">Mr. Solicitor General, I didn't mean to hit you.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.612" offset="1734802">They spend as I say, 85% of their money on personnel and they have a very -- carefully down through the years developed civil service and tenure laws for their people.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.254" offset="1789450">And now, instead of -- and I think this illustrates it best.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.346" offset="1801780">Instead of looking to the city council, looking to the local processes, procedures, the Civil Service Commission of the City of New York are the Civil Service Commission in the State in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.975" offset="1844308">What they do here is they look to the appellee, the Secretary of Labor and they looked to the Congress because once this power is established, every kind of employee in this whole nation has to go to the Congress or can go to Congress to get their employment status changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.600" offset="1914838">So they no longer look to City Hall, they no longer look to the state capitol.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.028" offset="1932497">This is a vast change in the outlook and the power and it's the centralization here in the federal Government of power over the most important group, because the cities are bundles of legal powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.130" offset="1996967">They can only act through people and this act touches every one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.399" offset="2013999">It's an assertion of sovereign power over every employee of a state and city throughout the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.097" offset="2040748">One of the experts that I would like to call the Court's attention to, to nail down how complex, to nail down how massive, to nail down the fact that this is a double standard of hours and wages is the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.509" offset="2138446">The Chairman of the Civil Service Commission appeared and I quote from about three sentences from page 9 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.134" offset="2164882">He appeared on the 26th of February 1975 before the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service in the House of Representative and this is what he said,“The extension of the Fair Labor Standards Act to federal employment is a case in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.831" offset="2227681">It adds a new set of complex provisions to the already existing provisions of Title V.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.751" offset="2275432">It creates two standards, governing pay and hours of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.352" offset="2297793">It results in double record keeping and double work.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.591" offset="2314721">It is an extremely high administrative cost --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="567.110" offset="2372817">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.996" offset="2384415">On page 9 down in the middle of the page, I'm reading three sentences from the testimony of the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission who spoke of how complex this act when it's imposed down upon the civil service system of the United States of America and how it imposes double standards, double bookkeeping, double work for negligible benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.355" offset="2489846">Now, it's even worst for states and cities because while the Congress gave this regulatory power to the Civil Service Commission so that disruption could be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.359" offset="2533836">Just think of what it's doing to the states and cities, we were all placed in with commercial enterprises before the Secretary of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.221" offset="2569258">We have in the act and in its application in this power shift, so many instances similar to the one I cited in the New Jersey where the existing law of states is wiped out, where the existing processes, procedures and such with respect to employee rights is wiped out.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.523" offset="2686495">Now, another thing this act does, it brings a whole new set of definitions of overtime of who is an expert.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.456" offset="2726201">There are 51 pages in the Code of Federal Regulation about who about what overtime is.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.894" offset="2747935">There are 42 pages defining who is an exempt person.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.440" offset="2766117">Now, the Civil Service Commission that we quoted in our brief said they're going to define themselves who is an exempt person.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.756" offset="2791403">But my major point is that there is such a vast shift in power to say what overtime shall be, just say who shall be exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.384" offset="2837901">All these kind of things when you impose those down on the area where states and the cities spend the majority of their money, where they have developed all these rules and regulations as in New Jersey for years and years, and their people have voted them in or voted them out and that's all gone now.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.983" offset="2900281">You're going to have it imposed from on high by the Secretary of Labor or by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.942" offset="2924210">The big impact in one area I think is most dramatic and that is in the area of voluntarism.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.753" offset="2975410">In the United States of America, in Government areas, we depend more on volunteers than any other system of Government in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.873" offset="2999860">And if the local level, we have volunteer fireman, we have volunteer police, we have volunteer of this and volunteer of that, there are millions of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.933" offset="3032148">Now, this act when it was written, it defined employ as to suffer our permit to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.653" offset="3062972">Now, that's all right insofar as private industries are concerned because they don't have this volunteer problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.298" offset="3093588">But look at the states and cities who sometimes pay a volunteer fireman $2.50 to go on each fire, look at the situation that exist where they sometimes give the volunteer policeman uniforms and they sometimes pay insurance on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.109" offset="3184807">Now, the only answer to that appellee is well, you just have to take it case by case as to where.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.662" offset="3211034">A volunteer crosses over the line from being a volunteer to being an employer or employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.708" offset="3239246">And so, that creates this consternation all across our nation and in other area, it's going to be very, very damaging.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.000" offset="3284386">At the local level, we use thousands of interns.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.928" offset="3300059">Now frankly, the interns are not worth that much to local Government, it's more of a favor to the intern to bring then in then it -- to a really a benefit for a state or city.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.178" offset="3341124">But now, they are going to have to be paid if certain things occur because of the interns have to leave and you pay him a little bit, you're going to have to pay him a lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.746" offset="3375397">But there's another area where this whole thing really hurts.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.868" offset="3391906">Many of the volunteer firemen, as the record showed, many of the volunteer policemen are already, let's say a city engineer or schoolteacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.938" offset="3424193">Now, if they go out as a volunteer on a fire or for some as a policeman and they worked in addition to their 40 hours as an engineer or schoolteacher, a few more hours and they are rule to be an employee during their volunteer time because they receive some minor compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.744" offset="3503397">Well, the act says that you've got to pay them time and a -- over -- time and a half for overtime at their same rate of pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.725" offset="3531295">Their may be a highly paid engineer getting $25,000.00 a year and when you look at paying him overtime for his volunteer firework or as volunteer police, you just mess up the structure of voluntarism throughout our nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.331" offset="3577689">I don't think there's ever been anything that has so cost, confusion, and this massive confusion was referred to by Mr. Alan Prichard, the Executive Vice President of the League of Cities in the record here saying that, “No one could really tell where you are and where you're going because you have all of these complex regulations imposed suddenly down on already complex, already regulatory regulations of the status and tenure of city employees.”</text>
            <text syncTime="898.407" offset="3698061">But, perhaps, one of the most devastating fears of states and cities is that this act creates class actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.573" offset="3738708">Now, you don't have class action against cities under their current set up but they do have fair hearings, they do have court cases, and as we point out giving any time, the one-third of all litigation before state courts is really involving personnel matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.987" offset="3800357">So here, you have this act saying that you can either -- the appellee or an employee can bring a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.731" offset="3839331">His attorney gets attorney's fees, it gets cost, and you get double time, triple time if you win.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.868" offset="3863886">Now, from a state in determining whether a man has crossed that line as a volunteer, from a state is to whether the intern gets too much, the damage is enormous because they can make a mistake of fact or law.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.502" offset="3926371">In a city like New York, it cannot run up to enormous, enormous cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="976.980" offset="4012366">Certainly, private business is when if the act went into effect in 1938 had to make very, very significant changes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1006.742" offset="4131380">You see, private business can't legislate, adjudicate tax and so they're an entirely different category than the private businessman.</text>

            <text syncTime="1032.704" offset="4235243">I don't think so because you didn't have the civil service laws in states similar to the federal service law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1151.971" offset="4712239">Because after looking at the enterprise system and upholding it as applied to all these private business criteria and all those private business cases, the next thing the court did, the majority opinion was to say now that we have upheld that act as applied to this criteria of nexus to commerce that's always been applied in a private business thing, we don't find enough of impact on states here to bring the Tenth Amendment into focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.726" offset="4851315">Now, of course hospitals and schools, they don't legislate, adjudicate or tax, and so, there's an -- and then to the -- the court pointed out, there's a court below who found that these schools and hospitals were in competition with the private business.</text>

            <text syncTime="1248.786" offset="5099583">Number two, it seems to limit the application of the act to those schools and hospitals who are in competition with private schools and hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.375" offset="5149947">And then finally, it seemed to say to the dissenters when they say you can take over a whole state by declaring an enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.246" offset="5197385">The comment was not while this Court sits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.870" offset="5207834">So, I think that there are factual distinctions there which showed that Wirtz hasn't had the impact on state and local Government that this massive takeover that we have here has had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.564" offset="5258616">So -- but I still think that the court should have in Wirtz considered the principles of constitutional federalism which we urge upon this Court and it didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.476" offset="5310339">It just said because we've already upheld this, commercial enterprise, the Tenth Amendment doesn't mean anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="1309.834" offset="5343775">So, I would say to Maryland versus Wirtz that it does not control this case because I draw from the principles of constitutional federalism and certainly, we have in our briefs going into this very, very deeply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.678" offset="5419112">This general rule that under the constitution at it was written even prior to the Tenth Amendment, all of the framers of the constitution were enunciating this idea that the federal Government could not and would not interfere with the states in their area of operation as Mr. Chief Justice Marshall said in MCulloch v. Maryland and vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.134" offset="5536977">There would be no interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.936" offset="5544187">And where do I find that rule?</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.612" offset="5550874">Well, I find it in the debates on the constitution of 1787.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.016" offset="5572504">I find it in the Federalist Papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.824" offset="5583684">I find it in the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.836" offset="5603746">I find it in statements of two Secretaries of Labor who opposed the application of this act to states and cities because it would be an undue interference and undue disruption and might bankrupt some of the small cities of this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.399" offset="5666022">I find it in the veto message of one president.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.195" offset="5677202">I find it in the statements by the Intergovernmental Relations Commission, which is the expert commission set up to look at these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.042" offset="5708549">I also find it overwhelmingly in the interpretation which the Congress itself has given to this intergovernmental relationship from the beginning of our constitution until now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.914" offset="5760063">In statute after statute, they have exempted states and cities for this very constitutional reason and even in this act up until 1966, it was complete exemption, they didn't take out that complete exemption until they brought public agencies in now as commercial enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.978" offset="5844281">So, I think our founding fathers understood the difference between Government and private business all through that constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.821" offset="5883674">There's more than a hundred mentions of states, only states can bring an original action here, no private person can do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.364" offset="5909901">I believe there has been an awful lot of fuzzy thinking about everything in our whole nation being commerce and it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.814" offset="5935606">Certainly, the act of a policeman in making an arrest isn't commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.326" offset="5949712">The act of a fireman in putting out a fire isn't commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.470" offset="5962250">The act of a judge of a state or of a city in deciding a case isn't commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.317" offset="5989627">The action of a zoning board in deciding a zoning, it isn't commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.274" offset="6013450">Now, all of this kind of thing Mr. Justice White was not presented in Maryland versus Wirtz as far as I can tell and I've read all the briefs in that case and there's no reference to it in the majority opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.283" offset="6057545">And I think these are the kind of things that the dissenters were concerned with when they were saying you get a mighty small little perspective on this whole problem when there is looking at hospitals and schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.334" offset="6105715">And now, we're presenting the whole picture, and when you look at the whole picture, there's certainly a massive intrusion, a massive control by the federal Government for the first time in the history of our nation of every person, every service rendered by states or cities because what this act does is it re-spummels the way they're going to do for service, it re-spummels the way you're going to do a lot of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.269" offset="6205503">And we say that it imposes enormous cost and when you impose enormous cost, that's one thing, but the big thing we talked about is the shift in power, the shift in power from the states to the federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.183" offset="6269137">Now, do we want it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.174" offset="6273108">Isn't this a massive interference with our constitutional system of shared powers, our federal system?</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.753" offset="6303410">We talked about federalism, federalism, federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.100" offset="6312814">Well, federalism has served this nation very well and up until now, states and cities who are urged have fairly taken care of their employees, who have collective bargaining of statutes and agreements and there are thousands of their members belong to unions as you can see from the amicus brief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.946" offset="6392226">All of that was never forcefully presented as far as I can tell in Maryland versus Wirtz.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.654" offset="6418975">And here, I could not say it -- more strongly than I have, I just think that we're looking at such a major shift of governmental power in our nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.527" offset="6498492">Something we have never had before and when you look at the necessity of it, what does the appellee said?</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.626" offset="6530884">He says that in 1973 when they were considering this act, it would only increase the payroll cost of states and cities three-tenths of 1%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.920" offset="6576128">He says also in 1974, it only increase the payroll cost and that would be $120 million a year incidentally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.885" offset="6607893">And in 1974, it would increase the payroll cost only one-half of 1% or $165 million.</text>

            <text syncTime="1774.866" offset="7203903">But, they are attacking the statement made by Congress that because in the overtime area for example, states and cities have such fair overtime premium laws now that there would be less than 1% added to the payrolls by the new overtime provision of this act and things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.219" offset="7281225">Now, I just think that de minimus, de minimus, de minimus, doesn't create constitutional power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.535" offset="7302541">And I find here in all of this history of constitutional federalism a sturdy, steady unwavering adherence by everyone up until now including the decision to this Court that the constitutional federalism is something that limits everything where you have -- in the constitution where you have a conflict between two Governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.845" offset="7427824">You have the tax power, you have the bankruptcy power where time and time again this Court had said hands off states, hands of cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.639" offset="7462933">You have cases like in the transportation field where over Maryland versus Johnson for example where the court held and Mr. Justice Holmes wrote the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.985" offset="7524373">He said, “Don't try to get us to decide this on these commerce cases involving private entry have nothing to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.398" offset="7553944">What we're talking about here is Government.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.518" offset="7562512">And so on the basis that he held it was invalid from Maryland to charge a postal truck driver a $3.00 driver's license fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.879" offset="7599919">So, the amount regardless of how many you have on either side should not decide this case because I think on this record, it is beyond question that the Congress is claiming power to regulate every state and city employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.482" offset="7682361">And I believe that the factual picture of this overwhelming massive change in Government, the centralization here of everything with everybody running to the Congress as they want to change in time or in their personnel status.</text>

            <text syncTime="1927.193" offset="7813183">Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.611" offset="7830841">I bring to the Court what must surely be a simple and true proposition but which is nevertheless escape the attention of our distinguish Congress; namely that the states are Governments not commercial enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.456" offset="7898237">We examine today the constitutionality of the 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act, an effort to convert the states into enterprises and thereby regulate and control the minimum wages in the maximum hours of their respective employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.776" offset="7967514">I wish to briefly outline the an foreseen consequences of the amendments on the California civil service system and then time permitting and if really necessary to point out the unconstitutional dimension of this unprecedented intrusion into the severance sphere of state Government in the name of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.289" offset="8065526">If I may, I'd like to turn to a purely governmental function of state Government namely fire-suppression; certainly, that is unique to the states in the cities in the counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.020" offset="8108471">I think our brief is out of what we pointed out the physical impact, but let me give you a few statistics and show you why a fireman is not a fireman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.013" offset="8152461">California does not operate a Norman Rockwell type fire department with the friendly Dalmatian sitting in front of the station house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.195" offset="8185166">We're 700 mile in length and we have 61 million acres of force that we protect out there, you could squeeze in eight of the North Eastern States into the State of California and still have room left over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.623" offset="8234904">We have more wide land undeveloped acreage then the library of Congress has books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.217" offset="8269281">Its rugged topography, it takes you three hours to get to a fire many times, sometimes you have to come in by parachute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.005" offset="8296448">40% of the United States Force Service budgets is spend in the state to California in 18 national force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.274" offset="8333542">And when we have fires we have fires, we don't extinguish fires; we have wars against fires.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.058" offset="8364680">They last for weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.228" offset="8373352">In 1970, we lost over 500,000 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.447" offset="8398221">At one point in one single period in a 13-day period at one peak, we have nearly 20,000 fire fighters on duty in the State to California fighting fires.</text>

            <text syncTime="2158.629" offset="8738962">And I'm sure that if we can extrapolate, I'm sure we have over a 100,000, at least a 100,000, that will covered by the FLSA amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.473" offset="8774280">Now what's the point of this dramatic recitation of mine on the fires in the State of California?</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.798" offset="8799566">Well namely, this firemen run up a lot of overtime and our practices then according to state law to give this man a premium during the entire fire season of 15%, they suddenly jump grade 15% during the whole season.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.380" offset="8861947">And the overtime they worked, they taken the winner months which they prepare so they can work secondary jobs and visit with their families during the holidays and the like and you don't hear that California employees association complaining about the current arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.294" offset="8921610">Yet according to Fair Labor Standards Act now, we've got to reduce these men to 60 hours per week and pay them time and half for every hour in excessive that, and our ability to recognize this overtime in order than cash is completely eliminated because the Fair Labor Standards Act requires that if you going to give them compensating time off, you have to do it within 28 days or pay the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.520" offset="9038430">Now, what possible business is it of the federal Government to dictate how we run our fire service program in the State of California when it's been proven satisfactory for all these years?</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.015" offset="9088481">The impact is $23.6 million annually to change our practices in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.731" offset="9131321">What about volunteerism?</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.500" offset="9138427">Mr. Rhyne mentioned volunteerism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.812" offset="9147622">In California, the cities and the counties work side by side in a mutual aid program that is unmatched any place in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.595" offset="9186806">They furnished these services to each other gratuitously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.783" offset="9199553">In some of the type of fires I mentioned a moment ago, the big ones, the uncontrollable fires, the Fair Labor Standards Act is going to wipe that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.946" offset="9240200">The impact on mutual aid alone in California is $6 million because volunteerism -- because these firemen are firemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.034" offset="9276562">When they're pulled in to cover a reserve unit while the rest of the crew goes in helps a neighboring jurisdiction, overtime rule start applying and the bill is a big one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.999" offset="9328389">We may point out that the national league statistic on this thing on the effective this act nationally is very conservative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.551" offset="9358587">They estimated it $200 million and they base that on paying overtime to all the firemen affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.308" offset="9393591">That's a conservative figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.163" offset="9405085">What the Fair Labor Standards Act would like us to do and what we've base our statistics on the State of California is reducing those hours and hiring new employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.890" offset="9447926">The act wants to hire new employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.835" offset="9459733">So if you take that figure, if the national league had gathered those figures, we be talking about $400 million annually to state and local Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.784" offset="9503514">The other adverse effects on civil service have been demonstrated by Mr. Rhyne I think very well during his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.960" offset="9532249">Another thing that you don't realized when you start fooling around with the working class salary at state levels is that you suddenly create compaction problems in the supervisory classes too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.199" offset="9581150">Let's remember that if you start paying overtime and adjusting the wages of the working line firemen in state in local service, you're going to be paying the Indians more than the chiefs and that's not going to last very long.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.253" offset="9637366">So the rippling effect all the way up through civil service is going to be felt and we have no idea what those figures are going to run but they're going to be big ones, and once which we think can't be supported in fact or in the constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2653.592" offset="10718730">It could be overrule simply on the fact that because the state purchases goods in interstate commerce, it's thereby engaged in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.629" offset="10758959">A question this Court has never addressed itself to is what do the states and cities and local Government do with the goods they purchased in interstate commerce?</text>

            <text syncTime="2678.372" offset="10817891">Even the Fair Labor Standards Act itself recognizes that ultimate consumers of goods purchased in interstate commerce are exempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2704.301" offset="10921650">The lower court found that to be true.</text>

            <text syncTime="2816.482" offset="11370329">I take it to the crux of the argument we're having today is really the impact of the 1974 amendments upon the Fair Labor -- to the Fair Labor Standards Act upon state in local Government sovereignty or to put another way upon the system of federalism established by the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.491" offset="11442322">I think the issue therefore is whether Maryland against Wirtz should be overruled in the position of the dissent there become the new law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2910.433" offset="11746179">But in the second place, I think this is a very unintrusive statute, much less intrusive than many kind of statutes that are concededly valid under the commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.842" offset="11787766">As we've said, this statute does not tell a state that it must give up any objective or that it must pursue any substantive object or any program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.119" offset="11828830">It leaves the state free entirely to choose all of its programs, keep them all abandon anyone that sees fit, but it does not have any policy control over the states as many federal statutes do which are valid into the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.483" offset="11906361">But I thought I would spend a moment upon the Commerce Clause predicate here before coming to the issue of whether federalism isn't some sense threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.205" offset="11957248">I think there can be no doubt that interstate commerce is involved when state and local Governments in 1971 purchased goods and services worth $135 billion which was at that time 12% of our gross national product, and I think there can be no doubt of a significance of these 1974 amendments to interstate commerce when we realized that they extend the coverage of the act to an additional 3.4 million state and local Government employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.710" offset="12083263">The 1966 amendments upheld in Maryland against Wirtz extended the coverage to 2.9 million employees, so that there are now a total of 6.3 million employees protected by the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.606" offset="12150868">And there are variety of reasons why this wage is an hours long is rationally related to Congress's power to control commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.462" offset="12186290">Now, I'm really sketch because I think they've been upheld in so many decisions of this Court that they need not be argued at length.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.111" offset="12216801">But first of course is simply that substandard working conditions can lead to labor disputes which interrupt the flow of goods and services across state lines.</text>

            <text syncTime="3058.855" offset="12339785">That labor strife theory of course is in the congressional findings in the original act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.753" offset="12363400">It is a basis for this Court upholding the 1966 amendments and their application to state and local Government in Maryland against Wirtz.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.352" offset="12397777">It was advanced by Senator Javits in debate in advancing the 1974 amendments and of course it is the theory under which the National Labor Relations Board -- National Labor Relations Act was upheld in Jones against Laughlin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.753" offset="12459426">Competition again between governmental units and private industry which is required to comply with the Labor Standards Act is an unfair method of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.523" offset="12506446">Third, competition between Governments exist and if some Government is used substandard labor conditions and compete with other Governments for new industries, new residence tourist and rather than raise taxes lower working conditions, they will tend to spread those working conditions to other Governments that are trying to compete for the same industries and rather than for tourist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.467" offset="12606234">And in that connection, I would call the Court's attention to the brief, amicus curiae filed by the State of Alabama, Colorado, Michigan, and Minnesota, states who apparently feel that their sovereignty is not seriously threatened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.710" offset="12659210">And at pages six and seven of that brief which I will not go through, they explained the competition between Governments and why that competition justifies the kind of statute amendments we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.951" offset="12736219">And particularly, I would call the Court's attention to the advertisements in the appendix which showed the State of Massachusetts advertising in the Sunday New York Times in March of this year to attract industry with tax incentives and the State of New York advertising in Fortune Magazine with tax incentives.</text>

            <text syncTime="3300.851" offset="13307779">And finally of course, Congress believed as the Senate report said that raising a minimum wage rate at a level which at least helps to assure the worker a decent income at or above the poverty level is essential to the reduction of welfare roles and overall reform of the welfare system in United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.687" offset="13391161">And I would think that obviously spreading the work through overtime requirements and requiring minimum wages is a way of getting people off welfare roles and train as productive workers and that's so obvious importance to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.127" offset="13444869">But these considerations, these various theories and so many times accepted by this Court and so overwhelmingly support that Commerce Clause predicate of the 74 amendments that I think the real argument, and the one I was spend my time on is the argument about federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.400" offset="13518012">Now, there is no doubt of course that states enjoy no absolute immunity from Commerce Clause regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.190" offset="13557196">And the cases to that effect recited in both the majority and to dissent in Maryland against Wirtz and in fact there is no doubt that the Commerce Clause maybe use to regulate what one might think of as an essential governmental function, similar to fire or police protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.728" offset="13623338">For example, in Sanitary District against United States, Chicago was prohibited under the federal power to control navigation and aspect of commerce from diverting water from Lake Michigan in order to carry away sewage, which I would think is an essential governmental function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.172" offset="13693032">The real argument is not that there is an essential governmental function that may not be touched.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.982" offset="13716334">It's that these amendments are swipe so broadly and has such an impact that they imperil state sovereignty and on entire constitutional system of federalism.</text>

            <text syncTime="3935.816" offset="15847612">We have heard this morning extensive argument about policy issues and Congress shouldn't do this because it's going to cost us the following amounts of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.795" offset="15895573">I agree that those arguments perhaps have been addressed by the appellants to Congress rather than to this Court because they are not constitutional arguments as they were put.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.997" offset="15944370">But I think it's relevant at least in counter balancing that to realize that we're talking about a Fair Labor Standards Act which will have less than 2% impact upon a State budget and the figure I just cited means that the federal Government is financing about 22% of state and local expenditures, so that -- this 1974 amendments are not as matters now stand going to swamp any fiscal policy that they hardly begin to measure up to what the federal Government pays for the states and local Governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.647" offset="16086998">The other item of realism that I would like to object, they inject is at this cry of the destruction, the immanent destruction of federalism has been raised in this Court in Commerce Clause cases ever since John Marshall was Chief Justice and I think it's no more accurate here than it was in Gibbons against Ogden.</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.471" offset="16162231">One of the more recent points of examples of this kind of rhetoric appeared in fact in the plaintiff's states brief in this Court in Maryland against Wirtz.</text>
            <text syncTime="4024.966" offset="16204236">I enjoy this particular line.</text>
            <text syncTime="4026.600" offset="16210819">The States then said in Maryland against Wirtz, pardon me, ever before in the history of this nation has the federal Government presumed to enact the law which both in theory and in practice, serves as the basis for the other destruction of the state as a sovereign political entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.221" offset="16285320">Now that rhetoric so closely resembles the rhetoric of the briefs here and of the oral argument here that I begin to think that perhaps it must be a boiler plate somewhere for resisting the exercise of the commerce power.</text>

            <text syncTime="4138.451" offset="16658244">But hardly enough, despite this rhetoric in Maryland against Wirtz or should I say so closely parallel as a rhetoric here, if the states were not destroyed, they were not even damaged, and I take it there, they seem to be healthier in many ways than they were at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4153.325" offset="16717699">So I think just in terms of the rhetoric we're talking about and in terms of the money we're talking about, I mentioned this merely to suggest that the appellant's argument about the imminent fall of the republic is entitled to be taking with a large dollop of skepticism.</text>
            <text syncTime="4167.024" offset="16772451">Now, I'd like to make just three points about federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="4171.162" offset="16789065">First, in enacting these 1974 amendments, Congress was very responsible, went to a very responsible process and indeed it was very sensitive to state and local problems and to state sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4185.126" offset="16844863">Second, I will argue to the law here involved is simply not of the type which is most threatening to state sovereignty and by nature, much less intrusive than other concededly valid exercises of the commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4199.859" offset="16903795">And third, I will argue that even if one ignores completely federal assistance to state budgets, the financial impact of the 1974 amendments is far too small to be thought threatening to state sovereignty in anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="4215.003" offset="16964399">Since the appellants accused Congress essentially of negligence and failing to make estimates and make a credible study of the cost impact and so forth, it's important to realize what the Congress did and the responsibility of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4226.651" offset="17011001">This is not a case of an unconsidered statute reeking unpredicted havoc.</text>
            <text syncTime="4233.082" offset="17036706">It's not that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4234.520" offset="17042453">I will draw the Court's attention to the amicus brief filed in this case by Senators Williams and Javits, and particularly at pages 5 to 13, the Senators described the process which Congress went through here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4252.063" offset="17112670">They had before them a detailed study of the cost impact of the 1966 amendments so that they could be guided by experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="4261.849" offset="17151749">They had before them a detail study of the feasibility of extending the acts coverage's was done in the 1974 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4269.785" offset="17183514">They had calculations of cost and they held lengthy hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.575" offset="17198665">The National League of Cities and appellant here expressed in those hearings concern about the overtime requirements as applied to firemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4283.545" offset="17238580">In response, the Senate House Conference wrote Section 7 (k) which I will discuss later and which permits a departure from the acts other overtime requirements precisely to meet the kind of problem with the National League of Cities and the California are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4302.747" offset="17315380">So that -- and Congress also exempted from coverage I might say, not only executive, administrative, and professional personnel, but also persons who hold public elective office, members of their personal stuff, persons who serve with a policy making level and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="4598.478" offset="18498309">So that my point is, the Congress was concerned with the preservation of state and local autonomy in terms of general financial impacts, in terms of particular local problems which they adjusted the statute to take care of, and in terms of exempting anyone in any degree of proximity to policy making and they try to preserve the value of federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="4621.920" offset="18592037">And my remaining two points are that they completely succeeded.</text>

            <text syncTime="4639.060" offset="18660686">This is a conceptual argument and I will come to the financial impact to a moment which is a factual argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="4660.268" offset="18745428">The law merely says that whatever policy you choose, you will not carry it out by paying the workers who carry it out, substandard wages and putting them under substandard working conditions which I think is a quite modest to constraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="4675.176" offset="18805091">Now, that constraint conceptually is a much smaller interference with state sovereignty than a federal substantive statute which tells a state that from now on, you may not have a state law on this subject; it must be the federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="4786.934" offset="19252099">I take that the first is a far more coercive intrusive interference with a individual's autonomy and hence by analogy with the state's sovereignty than the second.</text>

            <text syncTime="5253.131" offset="21116928">I think upholding those statutes was a correct decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5258.009" offset="21136468">All I say is that this statute is less of an intrusion upon sovereignty than those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5263.473" offset="21158306">And therefore, one is to draw the line, one would not draw with this statute as made myself a point about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5272.212" offset="21193206">And I should say that its hardly even theoretically possible that one could use a wage in hours law in a way that would destroy state sovereignty because they are tied to necessarily -- as long as they are similar to the wages and hours required of private employers and indeed of the federal Government as an employer of the impact upon the state and local Government cannot be so severe that state sovereignty is destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5302.991" offset="21316399">Well, this theoretical distinctions or considerations seem to me in and of themselves, sufficient to rebut appellant's predictions of impending doom.</text>
            <text syncTime="5315.305" offset="21365614">But I would like to move on to point out that the appellants have also rather thoroughly misunderstood the statute and its impact upon them so that the extravagant figures, claims as takeover and so forth are not really accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5334.001" offset="21440428">Now, the charges made us so plentiful and reflect such a rich and very misunderstanding of what's involved here that I can only touch upon the major items.</text>
            <text syncTime="5345.320" offset="21485672">First, the charge is that the 1974 amendments would cost some unspecified number of billions of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="5353.210" offset="21517228">There are dozens appear to be any foundation for that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5357.028" offset="21532484">The 1966 amendments had no impact even beginning to do that and there is nothing in this case that supports any speculation, we have had a breakdown of the items.</text>
            <text syncTime="5368.541" offset="21578564">Now, the impact as I said is on 409,000 workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5375.438" offset="21606149">95,000 new workers covered by the statute and 314,000 workers covered by the 66 amendments now have the minimum wage raised to $2.00 from a $1.80.</text>
            <text syncTime="5388.729" offset="21659335">But for the appellant's theory of this case would of course strike down the 1966 amendments also so that I assume about 409,000 workers would be vulnerable with substandard wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.327" offset="21709699">But, their principal concern appears to be the overtime requirements to the act and that concern I must say is greatly exaggerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5411.528" offset="21750554">The premium for work over 40 hours per week can be avoided by using additional employees on a straight time basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5419.265" offset="21781483">That will spread employment and that is what the Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="5422.995" offset="21796425">When they complain about that, I can only say that of course this statute requires states to do some things, not very many, differently than they might otherwise do them; that is the purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5436.777" offset="21851491">But the only specific national figure they give for the overtime cost is an estimate of $200 million for fire protection services.</text>
            <text syncTime="5449.301" offset="21901646">And we agree that most of the cost of this statute will be indeed overtime cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="5456.074" offset="21928709">But this $200 million that is mentioned is a vastly inflated figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5460.797" offset="21947622">It is based on the assumption that local Governments will not take advantage of the exemption of Section 7 (k) which I mentioned earlier which was put in the Senate House Conference on this bill, specifically because of the concern to express about fireman and overtime, and that Section 7 (k) provides that no overtime pay is due unless the employee works on average of over 60 hours per week in any 28-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5492.873" offset="22075935">Now only about 10% of the firefighting personnel in this nation work in excess of 60 hours per week and even the appellant as to that 10% apparently calculates only about $30 million in additional cost across the nation for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5511.347" offset="22149810">Now California argues in its brief that these firefighters -- their firefighters work an 84-hour week during the fire season, and that this act would have drastic results with respect to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5534.679" offset="22243119">I can see no impact of this statute upon the California system as it was described this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="5542.323" offset="22273735">The 84-hour week they described it in the California brief works as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="5549.234" offset="22301320">The firefighters worked four 24-hour days on followed by three 24-hour days off, followed by thee 24-hour days on and four 24-hour days off.</text>
            <text syncTime="5561.825" offset="22351684">California assumes, since there is an 84-hour week in there that it will have to pay 24-hours of overtime every week.</text>
            <text syncTime="5571.756" offset="22391390">But that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5573.625" offset="22398913">Under the statute, since these firefighters are in duty for over 24-hours continuously, sleep and meal times can be deducted, so if you take four, if you deduct sleep and meal times from this, they will not exceed 60 hours a week and overtime will not be due.</text>
            <text syncTime="5597.102" offset="22492850">Now in this connection, California complained readability about the compensatory time these firefighters work very hard during the fire season and take time off in the non-fire season.</text>
            <text syncTime="5611.645" offset="22550946">But compensatory time does not arise as a problem under these amendments unless you work the fireman more than 60 hours a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="5623.349" offset="22597757">If they don't work the fireman more than 60 hours a week, they can give them compensatory time or anything else they want in anyway they choose without interference from this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5632.864" offset="22635896">So that the entire system described this morning seems to me to fit well within the statute and not to impose the kind of additional cost or problems that California is talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="5646.618" offset="22690858">Now, the vexed matter of records and reports which seems to be confused almost beyond recognition, the question of reports which are discussed in the brief is simple, the act doe not require the preparation or the filing of any report.</text>
            <text syncTime="5664.515" offset="22762433">The question of records is about as simple and let me say this, when the appellant say that this act reached every employee of every local and state Government, it does so only in the sense that, even exempt employees must have a record kept, but if we look at the nature of the records, there are records which are not required by the federal Government to be kept in any particular form and the only information they require is information that any employer would obviously have about his workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5696.258" offset="22889388">It's the most elementary kind of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5698.136" offset="22896912">You have to have --</text>

            <text syncTime="5730.998" offset="23028360">Now the appellants have tried to confuse this issue by quoting at length from Robert Hampton who was the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission who was complaining about the application of this statute to the federal system and the federal system as at Page 9 and my brother Rhyne read from Page 9 this morning, I would point out the Robert Hampton had a special problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5756.367" offset="23129819">Congress want to pass this statute said you must give the federal worker whichever is better, Title V or the Fair Labor Standards Act so that they do have to keep records under Title V which different and under the Fair Labor Standards Act and they double computations and figure out in each case which gives the employee the better result.</text>

            <text syncTime="5783.221" offset="23237235">Now the act does preserve the state may keep more beneficial statute than this if it wished but they are not mandated as they are for the federal Government, and therefore Mr. Hampton's remarks are quite beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5796.704" offset="23291256">Now as to volunteers, the act as it has been interpreted and as it is enforced does not prevent the hiring -- the use of volunteer in any part of state Government and indeed reimbursement for reasonable expenses is allowed as a guideline for example for volunteer fire departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="5819.174" offset="23381117">$2.50 per call will not even be questioned above $2.50 per call.</text>

            <text syncTime="5836.290" offset="23449558">And by the way, the labor departments mad a study, the average volunteer fire department call is 20 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5844.280" offset="23481532">Now, there was reference to collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="5846.814" offset="23491668">This statute does nothing the collective bargaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="5875.033" offset="23604517">But I think what it boils down to is the appellant's case rest upon misunderstanding of the statute, and alarmist rhetoric is not a constitutional crisis here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5884.339" offset="23641715">There is not even a stiff reason at teapot.</text>
            <text syncTime="5887.162" offset="23653000">It's astounding to hear it argued I think in this stage of our constitutional history that federalism and state sovereignty depend upon the ability to give employees substandard wages and hours to give them less and the federal Government gives them, to give them less than private industry gives them, indeed often less than enough to keep them off the welfare rules, that cannot be the test of state sovereignty.</text>

            <text syncTime="6130.688" offset="24627158">I think they are not compelling constitutional reasons because it escapes me, why state sovereignty is threatened by being required to pay a dime or two more an hour is threatened by being required to pay time and a half over 40 or over 60 hours or to hire additional workers is a massive intrusion upon states' political and Governmental autonomy.</text>

            <text syncTime="6284.346" offset="25241767">I take it that my distinguished adversary admits that there is such a thing as constitutional federalism that exist but he says unless an Act of Congress, if I heard him right, unless an Act of Congress really wipes out the ability of a state Government to be a viable Government, you don't call it into play as a bar against legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6309.983" offset="25344376">Now, he says that the states are not hurt here, that this isn't enough of an intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6318.922" offset="25380112">But I call again to the Courts attention the $3.00-license fee was too much for Mr. Justice Holmes in Johnson versus Maryland when you're taking about a matter of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="6329.618" offset="25422848">We're talking about a matter of governmental power.</text>
            <text syncTime="6333.320" offset="25437686">We're not talking so much about money but on money.</text>
            <text syncTime="6339.054" offset="25460569">They say that our figures are exaggerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="6341.223" offset="25469241">Well, the record proved just to the contrary, this man who gave us the $200 million estimate of cost on fire service to comply with his act as a greatest expert in the United States on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="6354.242" offset="25521382">And there's one other little thing distinguished Solicitor General keeps talking about confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6360.814" offset="25547609">If there is anyone thing that is confused in his whole argument, it's this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6365.804" offset="25567566">He talks about working 60 hours or 84 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="6370.171" offset="25585121">Now, the plain truth is that of that 60 hours or that 56 hours in New Jersey, so much of it is what you call standby time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6382.441" offset="25634126">In the record at page 321, it's pointed out that when you're on duty for 24 hours and then 24 hours, that you have -- in that 24 hours, the first 24 hours, he has 16 hours of standby time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6396.241" offset="25689401">So, these people are there but only the difference between 16 hours and 24 is work-related time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6406.331" offset="25729735">The most popular jobs in the United States are these firemen's job because they don't have work related all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6414.021" offset="25760455">Now the other thing is that these regulations that were put out on the 20th of December last year, they provide this, that if that firemen is New Jersey under that New Jersey statute which over on Page 414, 415 or appendix works 24 hours, you cannot under the federal -- the new federal rule, you can't deduct sleep and eat time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6438.965" offset="25860242">And you see what that does immediately when he comes to the next 24 hours, he's very quickly into overtime.</text>
            <text syncTime="6443.938" offset="25880200">And we're not talking about substandard wages here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6448.003" offset="25896396">We're talking about people who earn $20,000, $25,000, or $30,000 or more a year working overtime.</text>
            <text syncTime="6454.637" offset="25922936">This idea, the most false idea that has been put forth is that substandard labor conditions exist in state and local Governments, they do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="6465.777" offset="25967553">And you notice how clever it is -- they start out by saying, we're talking about 409,000, 314 of those were really covered in 1966; nothing has been done about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6477.326" offset="26013738">We only have 95 new people who we claim are getting a salary below the minimum wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="6486.068" offset="26048637">And we tried to find out who they are, well it's just a statistic that somehow rather, somebody has come up with down it to the Department of Labor, you can't trace them down.</text>
            <text syncTime="6493.182" offset="26077163">And I say they don't exist and we've said that throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="6496.618" offset="26090851">There is no substandard labor conditions among states and cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6501.410" offset="26110077">They live with these.</text>
            <text syncTime="6502.583" offset="26114779">They're not going to starve them to death and justice in New Jersey, if they're going to go to a new platoon system, if they're going change the overall pay, these people in the New England town meeting or crosses country, they've vote on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6515.168" offset="26165039">After now, they have been able to vote on nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6516.919" offset="26172040">The most important question was from Mr. Justice Brennan when he talked about the republican form of Government because the biggest part of that republican form of Government if ballot box control and Mr. Justice Brennan is gone if this act is upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="6532.402" offset="26234002">Now, my distinguished colleague, the governor of Utah, Governor Hampton, leaned over to me and he made a statement that I think I should pass onto you.</text>
            <text syncTime="6544.243" offset="26281336">He said, “If they uphold this, there is no other stopping place.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6551.646" offset="26311011">From that complete swallowing up of state Government under the commerce clause and there is no logical place, just on and on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6559.781" offset="26343508">You talked about the nice Labor Relations Act, well, those acts are all being held over here in committees on Congress that you act on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6566.030" offset="26368481">If you uphold this, frankly, cities are gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="6572.441" offset="26394185">Their commercial enterprises and I just don't believe that anyone can't read the history of our nation when you come to a new claim of power, you have to go back to the sources of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="6586.640" offset="26450923">And I mentioned it was made for the Solicitor General about is being so amenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6594.486" offset="26482375">It didn't have any impact at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6596.522" offset="26490525">But I will remind the Court, I'll remind the Court as I was reminded again by Governor Hampton that the impact of Tea Tax in Boston was minimal but the principal was more than the people could stand to have someone else taxing them, someone else running their local affairs and this is what the states and cities are fighting for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6623.535" offset="26598567">That's exactly what they're fighting for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6625.714" offset="26607240">Now this idea that this act has no payroll impact, it not only a false statement but that is not a point at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6636.021" offset="26648513">The point is who is going to determine that payroll impact and this is just the beginning, the camel's nose under the tip -- that's certainly very, very true.</text>
            <text syncTime="6647.298" offset="26693548">And look at the enormous impact or just this one ruling that a fireman who works 24 hours on the job, you can't deduct his sleep and eat time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6657.149" offset="26732941">But for every other person in the entire nation, you can.</text>
            <text syncTime="6662.173" offset="26753108">So, there's no misunderstanding on our part.</text>
            <text syncTime="6665.441" offset="26766169">We know what this act says and he tries to justify it by saying, “Oh well, this might help welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="6673.988" offset="26800337">It might unemployment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6674.912" offset="26803994">And then he said, “In any event, we give $52 billion in revenue sharing,” well again putting Governor Hampton's note to me, he said he is very presumptuous to imply that state sovereignty is for sale for $52 billion or any other term.</text>
            <text syncTime="6692.671" offset="26875047">And after all, that money is the people money just being returned to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6697.375" offset="26893855">The idea that you can pay for it and take over the states is totally repugnant to our whole system of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="6708.064" offset="26936696">I believe that the concession both by the Solicitor General, by the Congress in it's report that this would have virtually no impact on the cities, the concession by Senators Javits and Williams in their brief that it will have no impact, why do it?</text>
            <text syncTime="6728.443" offset="27018198">Why take over?</text>
            <text syncTime="6730.303" offset="27025617">And statement about California, that's completely wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="6739.661" offset="27063024">Sleep and eat time is included in 84 hours to 72 hours or 60 hours, it has been up until now, and the only thing that they say, they say they're not forcing states or cities do anything; they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="6756.284" offset="27129584">This 24-hour no sleep-no eat thing is going to force them to hire an awful lot of new firemen and maybe some new police and as Mr. Jones pointed out, is a very, very costly things to hire and train all of these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="6772.249" offset="27193428">After all the states and cities have gotten along pretty good up until now and again I would reiterate over and over again, over and over again, there are no substandard labor conditions, there is no justification for this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6785.847" offset="27247762">Anyway, anyhow, no matter how you approach it, and the one thing also that I think is not particularly happy thing to have represented to this Court that the governors and mayors who presented these figures that were included here of 200 million and a billion in cost are liars.</text>
            <text syncTime="6808.287" offset="27337519">I don't think they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="6809.348" offset="27341803">I think they can make just as good estimates as a lot of other people and I think they made honest testament.</text>
            <text syncTime="6814.083" offset="27360716">They are honest people, they are hardworking people and they live there with their own people.</text>
            <text syncTime="6818.817" offset="27379628">And so, I think they gave their very best estimates and certainly this, well, for example, in the House Committee report, they estimate it, the first year impact of this act on the entire federal Government, do you know what it was?</text>
            <text syncTime="6834.567" offset="27442636">250,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="6837.360" offset="27453816">I saw the Post Master General sitting back here a few minutes ago and I saw a statement by him the other day that $68 million of his deficit is caused by this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6847.547" offset="27494567">I tried awfully hard to and I found a publication to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6854.112" offset="27520794">I tried awfully hard to get some other figures but all they tell me is this is awful, you can't get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6858.834" offset="27539707">And the idea that the civil service of the Unites States and the civil service of the states is different, it's just plain did wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="6869.301" offset="27581607">So, Mr. Hampton is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6871.263" offset="27589444">You got all of these statutes of states, he did been building up for 200 years, trying to be fair with these people and after all, if their not fair, they are there to tell them about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6880.866" offset="27627896">They live with them, day-in and day-out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6883.356" offset="27637823">And so, I think that here where this act really obliterates the division or governmental power upon which are whole nation is founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="6897.070" offset="27692680">Now is the time and Governor Hampton view.</text>
            <text syncTime="6902.816" offset="27715668">And the view of the governors he represents is chairman of all of the mayors and other public officials, now is the time to call to put a stop to this, let's call Government-Government and commerce-commerce and not try to turn just by a few words, whoever heard of the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="6923.622" offset="27798841">This one I've every seen where it calls commercial enterprises Government and over and over again defines and so write in the statute, they say our commercial enterprise is a city, public agency, well, that's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="6937.534" offset="27854535">This idea of competition that was mentioned in connection with Wirtz, well the court below found there was no competition here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6948.743" offset="27899361">They don't like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6950.588" offset="27906779">The idea that somehow rather because Government might compete with each other, well that's preposterous, the only competition I ever see is when they bid against each other for a city manager to improve their whole operations of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="6964.442" offset="27962159">So, I would just correct one other things, I have a letter here from the governor of Colorado instructing his Attorney General to withdraw his name from that brief that was just called your attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="6982.197" offset="28033212">So, in the idea of the Solicitor General said all you got to do is comply with 7 (k) and then you have no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="6989.101" offset="28060797">Well if you comply with 7 (k), you have to comply with this rule 24-hours on, you don't deduct sleep and eat.</text>
            <text syncTime="6995.636" offset="28086920">So, I come back, I started out by saying that we don't have substandard conditions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7004.168" offset="28121088">And what do they come up with this figure of 95,000 faceless wonders that they got from nowhere and there's no evidence whatever, not once until that those 95,000 exist and without that, the substandard idea is gone forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="7020.362" offset="28185872">Cities are not here to fighting to maintain substandard labor conditions, states are not here fighting to maintain substandard living conditions, these are their people.</text>
            <text syncTime="7030.217" offset="28225264">They live with them and we feel that they should continue as they have for 200 years and to tear up this system of shared governmental powers that has worked so well and this bicentennial year would be a monstrosity indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7048.010" offset="28296422">I end by saying Government is not commerce, and I ask the Court to recognize that ‘Government is Government and commerce is commerce' and that this decision below should be reversed because even there, the court doubted very much that this Court would want to stick with some of the broad language that was contained in Wirtz but they felt District Court judges shouldn't overrule this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7071.177" offset="28389104">Thank you.</text>
