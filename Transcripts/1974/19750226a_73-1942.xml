            <text syncTime="48.152" offset="298047">This is an appeal from a judgment of the highest court of the State of Florida in which a decision could be hand which decision upheld the unconstitutionally of the Jacksonville City ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.585" offset="351754">Which makes it unlawful ad provides, it is hereby declared a public nuisance to exhibit for certain persons to exhibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.818" offset="396685">Any motion picture in which the human male or female bare buttocks, human female bare breast or human bare pubic areas are shown if such motion picture is visible from any public street or public place.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.344" offset="474843">My client, Richard Erznoznik is the manager of the University Drive-In Theater.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.371" offset="506922">In 1972 shortly after the passage of this ordinance, he was charge with knowingly exhibiting a motion picture in which the human female buttocks and bare breast was shown said scenes being visible from a public street or a public place, and it was summons to appear in Court April 6, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.578" offset="595738">He appeared and by stipulation, the prosecution was stayed in order that we might test the constitutionality of this ordinance by an action for declaratory judgment in the Circuit Court of two-old-county which is the highest trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.980" offset="661358">We filed that complaint, we had our trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.191" offset="674210">The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the statute the District Court of Appeals affirmed relying upon the Chemline case from the First Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of Florida denied certiorari by 4-3 vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.300" offset="750592">Now, little more that it be said than has been said in my brief and the brief of amicus Motion Picture Association of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.367" offset="786850">What I would like to emphasize is the total failure of those who drafted this ordinance and the Florida Courts that have construed it to sharpen its focus and confine its proscriptions, so as not to censor or punish protected speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.524" offset="863545">We do not question the basic constitutional panel of the states and the cities to enact laws which punish or inhibit unprotected speech or which protect unwilling persons against obtrusive public displays of explicit sexual material which are both grossly offensive and unavoidable.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.188" offset="958213">But we do contend that such laws must be carefully drawn or authoritatively construed, so that they are not susceptible to application to speech protected by the First and the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1290.738" offset="5268417">It is not concern with public displays of scenes depicting explicit sexual activity and is not related to obscenity or pornography.</text>

            <text syncTime="1308.521" offset="5339470">It takes no account of the duration or the context of such nudity whether the scenes are from a travel log, etcetera and the ordinance classes violently, I think, with the long lying of cases in this Court which have drawn a distinction between protected and unprotected speech, the fighting word cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.535" offset="5431526">What is been said by this Court in the majority and the dissenting opinions in those cases from Cohen versus California to Caroline versus City of Cincinnati.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.417" offset="5471128">I think it applies to this case and condemned this ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.241" offset="5486383">For example, the Court said in Cohen versus California, “The ability of Government to shut off this course, solely to protect others from hearing it is dependent upon showing that substantial privacy interest of being invaded in an essentially intolerable manner.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.107" offset="5561825">This ordinance has not been so construed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1383.523" offset="5639461">If you take those principles and apply them to this case, this ordinance cannot stand constitutional master because it does nothing and says nothing to inhibit the traditionally unprotected speech, and on the other hand where movies are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.152" offset="5706021">It can never be said that the Chief and the child are no essential part of the exposition of ideas or that such as positions have so slight social value as to be step to truth that any benefit that make -- that maybe derive from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.147" offset="5797972">Though perhaps implied, in the city's brief and truth, their ordinance in question does not even concern itself with children, children littering or trespassing, and at least the Florida Courts have not so construed it in this Court must take it on its phase.</text>

            <text syncTime="1453.267" offset="5918448">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.733" offset="5932345">Sitting with me at the counsel table is Harry Shorstein, the general counsel of the city, I am the assistant counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.242" offset="5962439">And most of the cases set forth in the appellant's brief and the argument made here today would suggest that what we’re dealing with is obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.130" offset="5997965">But our position is at this particular ordinance deals solely with a public nuisance which has been long recognized to be the power and the duty of municipalities at common law to obey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.751" offset="6052404">Now, there's been some discussion at the ordinance, it doesn't deal specifically with children and doesn’t deal specifically with traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.021" offset="6077482">Normally, ordinances are not written in a; whereas, whereas, whereas form like a resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.995" offset="6101410">I think Court's know and this Court knows what everyone else knows and that is as one drives along the highway, one can see driving screen, screens, raises up in the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.520" offset="6147490">And if we see something and catches our eye, we tend to look at it and it could distract us and cause us problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.763" offset="6172463">I think we know as the file judge did in this case that children make up a percentage, a growing percentage that a population in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.845" offset="6208825">Certainly, the ordinance does not purport to regulate obscenity, only nudity and I certainly would suggest traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.502" offset="6247382">The willful and intentional exposure of one's private parts is been a crime at the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.380" offset="6278938">One of the cases sided in our brief dealt with some swimmers in the national forest who had been swimming in the nude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.737" offset="6304329">Then they decided they want to get him some watermelons into relying upon the riverbank in the nude eating watermelons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.555" offset="6327630">Their conviction was upheld by the Tenth Circuit and I think properly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.839" offset="6348737">Certainly, if you cannot prohibit this at the driving, you cannot prohibit it at the Hollywood Bowl or any place out in the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="1821.595" offset="7391754">Certainly, speaking of growing an ordinance narrowly to protect juveniles, it isn't like prior censorship or books that can be bought at bookstores or films that can be bought, there’s no way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.350" offset="7446821">Mr. Maness spoke of this and he's a former State Circuit Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.374" offset="7458941">There's no way you could draw an ordinance spelling all this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.160" offset="7470017">It would to submit it would be so long and involve and contradictory in terms that it would just be no way that it could be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.431" offset="7503141">Now, I might touch on what this Court has said from time to time about these matters in the Burstyn case in which the Court first held freedom of speech to apply to movie theaters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.930" offset="7561132">The Court said at page 502, “It does not follow that the constitutional requires absolute freedom to exhibit every motion picture of every kind at all times and all places, that’s what we have here.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.621" offset="7607944">Then the Redrup case spoke about protecting juveniles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.816" offset="7636679">In Stanley versus Georgia, this Court spoke of the danger of juveniles finding things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.889" offset="7661025">Now, the appellant in his brief says, “Well, that most parents if they are honest will admit that they don’t know what is proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.393" offset="7687043">Well, that’s something that a parent cannot advocate his responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.198" offset="7702194">Where you're conflicting testimonies from various child experts, to Dr. Spock and others and possible to some of the permissiveness that does emerge the greatest part of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.041" offset="7741586">But it's a parent's right, I think, we're speaking of constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.847" offset="7760812">It's his duty to see what his children see and don't see.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.895" offset="7789025">And I would like to talk about the Rabeck case decided most recently by this Court, which I think this is what we're talking about and its only opinion of this Court that I could find dealing with driving-in theaters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.784" offset="7856525">The question there was these sexually frank scenes but the statute did not make it clear that there would be punishment for showing it at the drive-in, whereas you would be permitted at the close-type theater.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.409" offset="7919010">But as said by the Chief Justice joined by Mr. Rehnquist in the separate concurring opinions, public displays of explicit material such as are described in this record are not significantly different from any noxious public nuisance, traditionally within the power of the states to regulate and prohibit, and in my view involved no significant countervailing First Amendment considerations, an offensive nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.132" offset="8029978">Certainly, it's something that has to be considerably weighing of the interest of the public is against the right of the man showing the movie.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.879" offset="8064982">They're not prohibited from showing nude movies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2059.936" offset="8345119">Mr. Chief Justice and if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.581" offset="8355777">I would like to just to add this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.065" offset="8365704">I realized that we can draw legal nice it is about the words -- was and the word force in unparticular like Mr. Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, language in Reed versus Washington where he said, “I for one would be unwilling to hold that the First Amendment prevents a State from prohibiting such a public display of scenes depicting explicit sexual activities, if the State undertook to do so under a statute narrowly drawn to protect the public from such potential exposure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.327" offset="8510736">I don't think we are quarrelling with that language ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.249" offset="8526409">What I'm saying is, the City claims the power to declare and abate nuisances and that is determination is conclusive and binding on the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.265" offset="8562458">And if such be so, while which we deny, it is a short step from declaring mere nudity a public nuisance when exhibited on an outdoor movie screen visible from a public place regardless of its context of his presentation and from there declaring movies with unpopular themes or ideas without nudity of public nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.696" offset="8648244">To delete one scene from any movie without regarding to its relation to the rest of the movie because the city council brands that scene, a public nuisance is to give the counsel the unbridle power of censorship of ideas and the power to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.831" offset="8716790">Perhaps, the one idea that just might help society solved the hang-ups that inhibit so many people in relationships with others, particularly between the sexes and among the sexes and for that matter races.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.963" offset="8769243">The city council does not speak for me when it determines that a bare human female breast on an outdoor movie screen is a public nuisance and it smacks of the male chauvinism then I think it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.664" offset="8816055">Women and men can be beautiful, ugly, good, bad, angels or devils, dressed or undress and the full range of human emotions maybe stirred, calmed, excited, and inspired by variety of events and all stages of dress and undress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.426" offset="8883137">People are humans; different, funny, sad, good, and depicting life in the movies, is and can be educational, entertaining and even inspirational.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.533" offset="8927545">One who denies the beauty of the human species or its potential for beauty simply because its form is not draped in clothing?</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.140" offset="8957952">We have device for our own creature comforts sends to impress others denies God’s handy work and has never strolled the beaches on a hot summer day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.612" offset="8995882">Do clothes make the women or the woman or does the woman make the clothes?</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.750" offset="9016466">Just as we are free to choose our dress or undress on the beach so, moviemakers and exhibitors on outdoor screen should not be denied the full range of their creativity simply because someone may look without paying or be offended without understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.202" offset="9082190">The public nuisance doctrine is inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.697" offset="9092221">The ordinance is overbroad and not carefully drawn or authoritatively construed and does reach there -- and it is not limited to unprotected speech.</text>
