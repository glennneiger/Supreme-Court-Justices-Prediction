            <text syncTime="16.067" offset="167685">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.528" offset="181478">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.141" offset="203943">Respondent was charged in a one-count indictment filed in the United States District Court for the northern district of Illinois, for having knowingly and unlawfully transported three aliens within the United States in violation of Title 8, United States Code, Section 132482.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.159" offset="271966">He filed a pretrial motion to suppress evidence alleging that he and his three passengers had been illegally arrested while in his car, and of the Government's evidence depended upon the testimony of the passengers, which he said was the fruit of the illegal arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.678" offset="338108">The District Court granted the motion to suppress the statements made by the passengers and their future testimony at respondent's trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.818" offset="370604">The Government appealed the decision, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court with one judge dissenting.</text>

            <text syncTime="74.055" offset="399548">To suppress the statements made, where and when were they made, or are you going to get to that I guess?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul L. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="77.954" offset="415222">Yes, I'm going to go through the facts in some detail because I think it's very important to the resolution of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.500" offset="437373">The issue on which we petitioned, is whether a defendant has standing to suppress statements and future testimony of witnesses on the ground that they were unlawfully arrested while passengers in his automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.046" offset="495574">The statements, I might say, took place later when they got down to the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.844" offset="514800">But the facts of the suppression hearing briefly show the following, I might add that they came solely from a police.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.166" offset="540087">He'd being the only the witness at the suppression hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.918" offset="551058">He testified that he, Officer Pat Vincent Tenudo was a police officer in the village of Villa Park, Illinois some 17 miles west of Chicago, that that was a small village of 25,000 to 30,000 people, about half residential and half industrial and that the industry consisted of small factories and businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.504" offset="629426">He also testified that the factories, some of them, often looked for cheap labor and he related three experiences of his own when he was involved in helping the checkout of individuals who've turned out to be illegal entrants from Mexico, who would apparently come to the area to work in the factories.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.081" offset="699747">In each case, those people have no identification, spoke no English and had arrived in the area either by car, bus or truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.387" offset="728900">Now in this particular night, he and his partner at about 2:30 in the morning did not stop a vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.482" offset="757321">They saw a vehicle already stopped, pulled over to the side of the road in the vacant lot at an intersection about 15 or 20 miles off the road. The lights of the car, the headlights were on.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.035" offset="799535">The interior dome light was on.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.919" offset="807058">The officers went over to see if they could be of assistance to see if these people were lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.586" offset="825762">It appeared to them the driver was looking at a piece of paper which may have been a map.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.162" offset="844048">And indeed when they drove over to the car, they saw respondent sitting behind the steering wheel on the driver side looking at an Illinois road map.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.343" offset="876753">Three other people were in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.487" offset="885321">One beside the driver in the front seat, two in the back seat, on the floor of the car were three shopping bags containing what appeared to be items of clothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.108" offset="927848">The officers before talking to the respondent and his passengers radioed in their location to headquarters and radioed in the license tag number of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.825" offset="974660">Officer Hall went over to the driver's side.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.789" offset="982497">Officer Tenudo went to the passenger side.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.625" offset="989915">Officer Hall asked the respondent if they could be of any help with the problem was.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.798" offset="1006529">Respondent said they were looking for a restaurant owned by a friend, but he didn't know the name of the restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.678" offset="1026069">They couldn't find that restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.926" offset="1031084">They were looking for another restaurant which he did name.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.116" offset="1047803">One of the officers radioed in to some of the neighboring towns, and from those towns found out at least that the restaurant in the area closed by midnight or 1 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.065" offset="1079672">Although not necessarily all the restaurants closed by midnight or 1 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.896" offset="1099003">At this point, Officer Hall asked respondent for some identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.615" offset="1117811">He showed the officer what appeared to be and apparently valid Illinois driver's license.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.101" offset="1139754">Now either at about that same time or later when they got back to the station, although we don't think it's particularly important which.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.950" offset="1167130">The radio dispatcher informed to the officers that they had checked out the license tag number.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.721" offset="1186252">The car belonged to the same individual whose name appeared on the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.741" offset="1202343">The car was not stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.947" offset="1207150">It was not wanted in connection with any particular crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.137" offset="1223868">The officer, after checking the driver's license, asked the passengers for identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.552" offset="1249573">They shrugged their shoulders as if they didn't understand the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.904" offset="1262947">The officer repeated the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.861" offset="1270784">He got the same response.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.015" offset="1279457">He then asked the driver --</text>

            <text syncTime="300.051" offset="1303594">And the passengers indicated by gesture that they didn't understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.406" offset="1328985">He then, the officer, asked respondent whether he spoke Spanish.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul L. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="312.210" offset="1352182">The respondent was the driver, the other three, passengers in his car.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.396" offset="1376946">He asked him if he spoke Spanish and if he would ask the passengers for identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.835" offset="1394709">The respondent said something to the three passengers in a language the officers did not understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.014" offset="1415398">They assumed it to be Spanish.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.098" offset="1423757">In response to the respondent's inquiry, the two people in the back shook their heads back and forth as if to indicate, no they had no identification, assuming that was the question asked by the driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.911" offset="1470986">The gentleman in the front seat handed the officers a little card written in a foreign language which appeared to be Spanish.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.811" offset="1498572">The officers couldn't read except to make out three words, army, military and Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.959" offset="1519156">They assumed that that -- they concluded that that meant that the -- that was an army identification card from Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.783" offset="1546533">They called their sergeant.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.534" offset="1553533">The sergeant arrived a few minutes later.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.177" offset="1564087">Through respondent, asked the two passengers in the back seat, the two without identification, to get out of the car and to come to the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.690" offset="1594180">They placed them in a police vehicle to transport them to the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.600" offset="1609749">At that point, Officer Hall asked respondent if he wouldn't mind coming to the station while a check was done on the two persons without identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.051" offset="1643604">Respondent answered “Fine, I will come with you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="388.624" offset="1657919">And along with the passenger who had shown identification, he followed the officers to the station in his own car.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.257" offset="1680384">At no time prior to the trip to the station did any police officer enter the car or search the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.561" offset="1705566">And when they got to the station, the sergeant asked the three passengers, again through respondent, if they would write down on a piece of paper their names and their ages.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.986" offset="1747362">He then called the local office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to run a name check on these three people, and Chief Parton of that Service asked to speak with the three passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.684" offset="1786128">He spoke with each of them in Spanish, but what sounded to the officers to be Spanish.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.682" offset="1806085">And after speaking with them, told the sergeant to hold off four men until morning, because the three men had admitted that they were in the country illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.805" offset="1846627">Now, just to round out the picture of what happened at the hearing, in response to some hypothetical questions from court and counsel, the officer testified that if respondent had driven off without asking permission after having shown his driver's license but with the unidentified persons still on the car, he would've been stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.487" offset="1921337">He also testified however that if he had refused to come to the station when asked, respondent would've been free to leave, his license having been checked out and there being no further reason to detain him.</text>

            <text syncTime="469.784" offset="1982464">Not with his passengers, at least that's certainly the implication of the officer's answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.662" offset="2002004">And the inference we draw from those two inquiries answered is that he would've been detained if he tried to leave with the passengers, because they hadn't been checked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.171" offset="2036067">But he would've been free to leave alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.806" offset="2046621">Now the District Court granted the motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.487" offset="2061354">He found that the license check was reasonable, but anything thereafter was unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.036" offset="2079535">No need -- no justification to detain them further and to interrogate the passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.375" offset="2096880">He found that the interrogation constituted the search of the car, even though the passengers were in plain view.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.276" offset="2120495">And solely for the purposes of challenging finding, and that some illegality flowed from it, we assumed arguendo in the Court of Appeals that it was a search, but the whole incident at the car was lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.707" offset="2170232">And he also said that the arrest of respondent and his passengers were unlawful and that everything that flowed were fruits and should be suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.990" offset="2199280">Now the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.997" offset="2207326">What it did, and we think its' important for analysis, is it said there were three steps in the facts as they developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.452" offset="2233135">The first step was the license check and that was perfectly reasonable and justified.</text>

            <text syncTime="545.226" offset="2284231">The second step according to the Court of Appeals began when the driver was given his license back, and everything else that happened at the car, the interrogation of the passengers, was the second steps, said the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.944" offset="2331146">And the third step was the period beginning with the trip to the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.886" offset="2346924">Now the problem, as the case comes here we think, is that while the court said the first step was reasonable and the third step wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.352" offset="2376808">It didn't talk about the second step.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.578" offset="2385690">It moved immediately to the third step and said that that was an unlawful arrest taking them to the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.604" offset="2409827">That respondent was unlawfully arrested, and that everything that flowed was fruits of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.321" offset="2432606">Now the dissenting judge, also addressing himself to that first, said that he thought everything was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.309" offset="2452564">But then went on to say “If we're talking about the respondent's arrest, respondent's got no standing ‘coz nothing flowed from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.412" offset="2477014">And secondly, that even assuming some illegality, live witness testimony should be treated differently for purposes of the exclusionary rule from inanimate objects.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1545.940" offset="6287130">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.741" offset="6306356">This case arises out of the Villa Park, Illinois night time practice and procedure of demanding satisfactory proof of identity from everyone encountered in that suburb in an automobile, and taking those persons who can't produce the requested identity documents to the police station to see whether or not they may be criminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.448" offset="6413145">And frankly a little disappointed that the Government didn't address this problem a little bit more carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.103" offset="6439790">That here we have an extraordinary dragnet procedure which I think poses great threats to Fourth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.664" offset="6482004">The routine in this case is so comprehensive that the police in Villa Park would stop and demand proof of identity and take people to the jail to see if the might be criminals that they were merely encountered at the side of the road changing an obvious flat tire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.754" offset="6562356">That's the kind of practice that we're dealing with in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1618.285" offset="6576462">Well, there's no indication that if the occupants in this car or any car had given their identity and that it checked out that they would've been taken to any station now, is there?</text>

            <text syncTime="1635.159" offset="6643963">I think it's clear from the testimony in the case that if everyone in the car that has all four passengers had had identity documents satisfactory to the police officers, then they could've continued on their business.</text>

            <text syncTime="1649.524" offset="6701432">In this case, we're dealing with passengers who could not speak English against the background of, so the record indicates, a number of employers in that community hiring illegal Mexican aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.759" offset="6762454">And so that's another element to be taken into account, isn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.166" offset="6784084">We aren't concerned in this case with what they have been doing in some other cases with English speaking passengers who are changing tires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.862" offset="6814804">We're concerned with Spanish speaking passengers 2:30 in the morning, aren't we?</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph Beeler</label>
            <text syncTime="1687.074" offset="6851688">Precisely and I think it's important that the Court take careful note of how it was that the Spanish identity of these passengers was learned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.523" offset="6897455">If this was something that was paraded on the outside of the car, something that the police knew before they began their investigation, and before they detained Mr. Sanchez, then perhaps assuming that there had been some evidence in this case that the police officers were authorized to enforce immigration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.754" offset="6994422">And I'd point out the District Court judge held on that holding has not been overturned nor the Government challenged it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.239" offset="7024306">But Illinois police officers are not vested with authority to investigate immigration offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.318" offset="7052622">I think that Officer Tenudo had any confidence or experience that was meaningful in investigating immigration offenses, if he knew a few simple things like whether Puerto Ricans are American citizens or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.384" offset="7116884">We were able to recognize Mexicans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.787" offset="7126497">With his own testimony was that he couldn't recognize Mexicans that he couldn't recognize Spanish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.634" offset="7149902">So we have the circumstance here that because this is an immigration offense doesn't change things very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.452" offset="7205177">I mentioned the fact that the police learned that this was a group of four people, three of whom were Mexican aliens after the police encounter began.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.761" offset="7278425">The Government in its statement of facts suggests that there is a question as to when the police radio report came back from the radio dispatcher indicating that Mr. Sanchez was the owner of the motor vehicle and that the motor vehicle was not stolen or wanted in connection with any crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.041" offset="7387512">I think that the record couldn't be clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.642" offset="7401932">After all, the Government's own witness, Mr. Tenudo testified that it came back immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.458" offset="7429204">But at the time that Mr. Sanchez's driver's license was returned to him, the police knew there was absolutely no suspicion connected with this car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.528" offset="7481448">I would point out that I believe its footnote 9 of our brief deals extensively with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.029" offset="7539440">But his is an argument which the Government has raised for the first time in the Supreme Court on its brief in the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.401" offset="7569011">And this is never raised the question below as to when this radio report came back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.240" offset="7588342">And I think the Court, for purposes of this argument at least, until it can examine the footnote carefully should assume that the police had no reasonable suspicion whatsoever as to the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.928" offset="7651035">And whatever reasonable suspicion they may have had initially had been dispelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.675" offset="7674023">They had returned the driver's license, yet rather than let Mr. Sanchez drive on as he was entitled to, they testified that if he had attempted to leave at that time they would've have chased after him and pulled him off again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.643" offset="7761899">It was then after he was detained in what we submit is a clear violation of Terry versus Ohio, since there was no basis whatsoever for the detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.358" offset="7808815">It was then that they asked the passengers if they wouldn't produce also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.328" offset="7836714">And it was then and only then that they learned these individuals didn't speak English.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.233" offset="7868270">This flowed from the detention of Mr. Sanchez.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.093" offset="7887705">This is the second stage which the Government doesn't want to talk about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.054" offset="7903587">But this is what the defendant has been arguing ever since the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.396" offset="7920933">We have not changed our argument one wit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.717" offset="7934203">The Government, I think it will be demonstrated, has been over the lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.696" offset="7966177">The defendant in this case has standing, which is the only issue presented in the cert petition, because Mr. Sanchez, his own personal constitutional rights were violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.300" offset="8016541">He has a right to use the public highways free of temporary detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.715" offset="8042245">Those rights were violated when he wasn't free to move on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.462" offset="8065233">As a direct result of this dragnet police practice in violation of his rights --</text>

            <text syncTime="3954.622" offset="15921821">Well I think it certainly does, because there was some articulable reason at some point to ask them some questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.125" offset="15951914">And after that there was some articulable reason to try to find out who they work further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.995" offset="15967378">Just to detain them -- to determine their identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.989" offset="15979290">That's all that this case is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.193" offset="15988172">Now Justice White asked a question a little while ago about are there any cases where the courts have said you can ask passengers in a car for identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.862" offset="16022862">One case that I know of is a case called United States versus Madenville, 445 F.2d, 822, a Ninth Circuit case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3989.469" offset="16061210">But the -- and that makes a point it's okay to ask identity of people in the car as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.502" offset="16117426">Let me just make two other points.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.113" offset="16131845">Respondent argues concerning live witness and says that the Smith and Bowden case written by the Chief Justice, talked about all the intervening things and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.285" offset="16172492">We think that the Chief Justice's concurring opinion in Roger-Brown makes clear that what was being discussed there was you don't suppress live witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4026.414" offset="16209063">Cross-examination is sufficient to protect people's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.304" offset="16224632">It goes to weight in that admissibility, whether depending upon how they were seized, how they were come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.114" offset="16247829">We also think that this case is different from the case if they had gone into a trunk and found witnesses in a trunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.533" offset="16269458">These witnesses were not come at by any search or any illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.506" offset="16285445">They were there in plain view, and they were not the result of any sort of a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.432" offset="16309060">And even looking at respondent's argument at its most favorable light, he says that if he had been permitted to drive on after showing his license, the police would've obtained no evidence against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.355" offset="16356812">And that that's what this case is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.042" offset="16363499">If he had been permitted to drive on, we say everything else would've been just the same as it is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4070.789" offset="16386487">The passengers would've been detained.</text>
            <text syncTime="4072.793" offset="16394533">The evidence flowed from them, had nothing to do with his detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4076.703" offset="16410206">And we think if you get to stage two that that may be relevant.</text>
