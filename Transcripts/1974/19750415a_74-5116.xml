            <label>Mr. Harvey S. Swickle</label>
            <text syncTime="39.098" offset="259741">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.986" offset="271339">There are two issues that are presented here for this Court's consideration today, both dealing with pretrial publicity in a criminal matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.286" offset="300492">First question that is presented is whether the jury's knowledge to the news media of a defendant's prior convictions is so inherently prejudicial that the jury should be excused for cause or a change of venue granted, notwithstanding those juror's assurances of impartiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.241" offset="376351">The second question which this Court has to deal with is whether the totality of circumstances in this particular case warranted a change of venue on behalf of the defendant in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.376" offset="452838">The pertinent facts with regards to this issue are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.007" offset="467362">On January 8, 1968 the defendant was arrested for the commission of an armed robbery in Dade County, Miami Beach, Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.562" offset="501635">During the pretrial proceedings of that case he filed a motion for change of venue as well as a plea of not guilty and plea of not guilty by reason of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.160" offset="544057">While this particular case was pending in that case number and that first case was 68530, the defendant was indicted in the Broward County which is a northern county directly north of Dade County and charged with a crime of first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.620" offset="613857">Those cases gained notoriety in the news in Dade and Broward County and known as the Whiskey Creek murder cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.377" offset="648861">After that case, he was also indicted in a federal court with regards to transportation of stolen securities arising out of the Whiskey Creek murder case.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.422" offset="685014">So at one time or another, there were three prosecutions pending against Mr. Murphy.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.199" offset="704136">In Dade County, Judge Steadman, after a lengthy hearing found the defendant incompetent to stand trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.351" offset="732766">The defendant was then committed to South Florida State Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.919" offset="747081">Mr. Gerstein, the state attorney then now pros that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.692" offset="766098">I think its important to point out here that at the time of the insanity ruling there was a tremendous outcry all the way up to the Governor’s mansion and Governor Clark ordered an investigation into the insanity ruling that Mr. Sherman who was a state senator at the time and who is now the Attorney General in the State of Florida, initiated an investigation of Judge Steadman with regards to this particular incident, all while legal proceedings were still pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.918" offset="899009">In March 1, 1969, the defendant was found guilty of the murder case subsequent to the now prosing of the Dade County case, Mr. Murphy was transferred to Broward County, there were legal proceedings for almost a year and on March 1, he was found guilty of first degree murder.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.090" offset="1015724">The substantial amount of publicity however was from the Miami Herald and the Fort Lauderdale News.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.881" offset="1178937">In December 1969 prior to the trial which was almost a year prior to the trial of the Wofford case, Mr. Murphy then entered a plea in the Federal case before Judge Eaton in Miami.</text>

            <text syncTime="1248.772" offset="5098454">The issue presented by this case as has been stated by counsel for the petitioner is essentially whether a state defendant's trial by a jury is rendered essentially unfair and therefore violative of due process when members of that jury have some knowledge of the defendant's prior criminal background and knowledge of some the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.244" offset="5188315">And the petitioner asserts this error at the level of constitutional violation on the basis that there was failure to excuse these jurors of cause and in the alternative that his motions for a change in venue were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.366" offset="5248815">We submit that these issues were properly decided by the two federal courts below and that their reasoning should be dispositive of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.875" offset="5274833">I would submit that the reasons therefore are rather extensive and there is no precedent that either of the lower federal courts had for requiring disqualification of a state juror because he had knowledge of the defendant's criminal past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.291" offset="5344528">It would require the elevation of this Court's holding in Marshall, not only to Sixth Amendment standards, but also require that that be then enforced against the state as an aspect of due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1336.376" offset="5448913">Now the jurors who actually served, the six who counsel mentioned just a few moments ago, met the Court’s -- this Court’s standards for determining the viability of these jurors in Irvin versus Dowd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.030" offset="5499486">The standard is even set forth in Florida as a statute, Florida Statute 913 03, which requires that the Irvin v. Dowd standard be carried out in Florida trial courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.235" offset="5556328">Secondly, I would point out that the publicity to which the defendant was subjected was not the kind of publicity which the cases on which he relies in the point two were actually decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="1708.210" offset="6936221">And that is that it's most significant that the trial in this case involved a defendant who had drawn not only statewide, but nationwide attention to himself with some of his previous exploits, among these, the highly publicized star of India jewel theft from the New York Museum of Natural History.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.230" offset="7016260">After his release on this and prior to the rubbery in the instant case, there were two other highly significant crimes which he committed also in the state of Florida and each of this crimes drew intensive publicity at that time, but of course they were long prior to this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.948" offset="7087208">The Miami Herald which was -- it is presented most broadly in the appendix to this case is the leading paper statewide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.502" offset="7133393">In addition to other papers which appear in various regional parts of Florida, the Miami Herald does have a statewide circulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.745" offset="7166307">Now it would have been extremely difficult to find the panel of jurors anywhere within the state who as the result of the Star of India and publicity on the subsequent crimes would not have had some concept that this events had transpired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.027" offset="7223463">In addition, the district on habeas corpus had no constitutional precedent by which he could decide that Marshall should be the test which should have been applied in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.169" offset="7296084">Marshall would serve indeed as poor precedent in a case such as the one at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.344" offset="7320743">The requirement that the states should be controlled by Marshall would impose a severe hardship in a situation of the notorious defendant who were then not be able to find, with the status I should say, would not be able to find a defendant for such a case probably anywhere in the state who had not known of a conviction for one of these prior crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.812" offset="7410604">The extent of publicity have reached the point, let me point out here that there was even a movie made of some of these exploits so the district judge who was quite justified in finding that this was a notorious defendant --</text>

            <text syncTime="1841.077" offset="7467656">Mr. Rogers, do you tie that in to the change of venue for the other co-defendants?</text>

            <text syncTime="1848.913" offset="7499003">Yes Your Honor, I would point out two factors regarding that change of venue on a separate federal crime that is that one, the declaration that by this defendant that he was guilty and was a co defendant with the others would necessitate that the federal judge change the venue for that particular crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.312" offset="7572668">And secondly, the ease with which the co-defendants obtained the jury in Pensacola, a remote part of Florida, is easily explained by the fact that the co-defendants did not have anything like the notoriety that this defendant had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.477" offset="7621256">So once we removed Mr. Murphy from the four defendants, then the other three defendants can quite easily get a jury as they have virtually no notoriety in further fame or reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.193" offset="7668172">Mr. Murphy's name would not enter into a jury's consideration whether he could give any of the three co-defendant's a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.024" offset="7703489">The requirement that the states be bound by the Marshall doctrine would place the state in a position quite different from the federal trial courts in that any federal trial court does have a jurisdiction over a federal crime and under rule 21, a federal defendant who is so put upon could succeed in getting his caused transferred to the most remote federal district court in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.971" offset="7807248">The states would be hard pressed to have the same flexibility and indeed a defendant who would be known statewide for particular crimes within that state could very well find himself without a jury and there will be no possibility of affording the man a trial at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.972" offset="7879241">That is probably the strongest reason which we can assert that the more flexible Irvin v. Dowd standard is the one that is properly applied to the states, whereas, the Marshall requirement can continue as a viable standard for the federal judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.244" offset="7936397">It is just such a situation as this which prompts the distinctions between federal and state practice and the distinctions indeed which have been approved in Spencer versus Texas of there being -- the possibility of variations in practice between the state and federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.388" offset="8044962">If I may address the second point with my remaining time, we did not have the situation in Dade County which would qualify under any of the tests or any of the factual patterns in Rideau versus Louisiana, Estes versus Texas, or Irvin versus Dowd in which it was clear from the nature of the case, the size of the community, the intensity and the viciousness of the publicity which infected those small communities that it was clear that we could have presumed that any defendant brought -- that these defendants brought before any jury in that selected from a venire from that community could not receive a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.496" offset="8205354">The concept that too many jurors, too many times had announced their prejudice in Irvin versus Dowd, would not find any parallel in the transcript in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.754" offset="8258435">The jurors who actually served, gave quite viable and quite rational explanations of their impartiality and the passage of time was not the least of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.074" offset="8295633">Clearly although they had some knowledge prior to the time they entered the courtroom of the defendant’s background and the defendant's prior crimes, there's no doubt that the passage of time does dim these recollections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.342" offset="8344743">What made matters worst as to some of these jurors was that the manner of examination on voir dire refreshed all of their recollections and indeed led some of the jurors into saying that I did not know that that was the fact until counsel mentioned it during voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.438" offset="8409109">So the passage of time certainly had been the recollection of these facts as far as many of these jurors were concerned. The size of the community in Dade County also removes it from the inherent prejudice category and places this judge as very reasonably having denied a motion of change of venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.833" offset="8478699">He did this after he observed the demeanor of all the witnesses on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.714" offset="8494268">He deferred ruling on this motion at the time it was made and declared that he would not rule on it until he had observed the panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.053" offset="8519555">So indeed, he did have every opportunity for filtering out any prejudice that may have been likened in the community and presents a record before this Court which represents a reasonable basis on which to say that the courts below are quite correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.140" offset="8591966">Now, we submit that affirmance is warranted on this cases because the petitioner was afforded a full measure of due process as that has been defined by this Court in Irvin versus Dowd.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.625" offset="8645883">Indeed, the Irvin versus Dowd standard has been adopted by at least 12 states which have had occasion to pass on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.474" offset="8677230">It would be quite surprising to most of the state courts if the Marshall standard were now deemed to be super imposed and required after what appear to have been settled precedent in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.161" offset="8724041">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2159.411" offset="8740968">Yes Your Honor, just very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.014" offset="8759463">Mr. Justice Marshall, your concern with regards to the jurors who said that they had discussed this or heard discussions in the jury room was not I would say all the jurors, this was the point I was trying to bring out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.745" offset="8814320">I would say 70 or 60% of the jurors who were actually questioned indicated that there were discussions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.783" offset="8838457">What I wanted to point out is that it seemed that the jurors who sat on the jury panel were the ones who didn't hear any discussions and the ones that were excused for various reasons either for cause or for medical reasons or excused by the state or excused by the defendant, those jurors seem to have a different view of what transpired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.799" offset="8918601">Now, I would just like to give you a quick rundown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.309" offset="8932603">Patricia Asher who was the first juror who said she had heard one person discussing the case and then one person had formed an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.753" offset="8958412">The immediate two jurors after her, Frank Kell and Art Fleming, Mr. Kell said the majority of the perspective jurors had formed an opinion that the defendant was guilty, that's at page 108.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.009" offset="9003447">Mr. Fleming who came immediately after Mr. Kell said, the juror discussing the case stated put him away, throw away the key, there was a consensus of -- that was the consensus of the opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.846" offset="9050781">The next juror who sat was Mr. Collins.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.286" offset="9064469">Mr. Collins who was able to sit and then impartially listen to this case said, “no one in the jury room had formed an opinion of this case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.485" offset="9093308">However, the jurors both before him and after him are referring to again Mr. Fleming and Mr. Pererro, Mr. Pererro says, “discussions about Murphy, there were discussions about his prior convictions and the jurors had formed an opinion of guilt.</text>
