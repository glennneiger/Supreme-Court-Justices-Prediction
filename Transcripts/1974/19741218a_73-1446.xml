            <text syncTime="55.245" offset="324315">The critical question in this case is whether the First Amendment's prohibition against prior restraint is violated by the grant of a total preliminary injunction against the distribution of a scientific book.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.467" offset="385233">A cycle of therapeutic cases where the only finding which has been made by any judge concerning disguise of the patients is that the defendant doctor took reasonable steps to meet the usual standards for disguising the patient's identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.356" offset="452838">The injunction has been in effect since May 7th of 1973 more than 17 months.</text>

            <text syncTime="118.363" offset="576867">The words appear at 883, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.284" offset="592541">883 in the appendix and if I may read, defendants have taken some steps to disguise the identity of the patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.595" offset="629739">I think those steps reasonably meet the usual standards for such disguising of the patient's identities.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.849" offset="654817">That is the only finding which has been made concerning disguise.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.059" offset="675610">And then the court engages in this bit of speculation as to who might be able to penetrate the disguise.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.150" offset="703927">The court says, while I have not read this 1,000 page book, the examples of possible identification given by plaintiff in the moving affidavit must be assumed to be the more striking ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.378" offset="744887">I do not think that they would really identify plaintiff as the patient to someone who did not already know that plaintiff was the patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.620" offset="789817">Necessarily subsumed into this primary question of the prior restraint is the connective question of what are the constitutional limits of any cause of action, which would seek to impose liability on a doctor for publication of a case history.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.614" offset="865782">And as much as there can be no provisional remedy equitable or otherwise in the absence of a constitutionally sufficient cause of action, this second question is of necessity subsumed in the first, while the constitutionality of a prior restraint on publication is hardly enough of question for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.607" offset="941850">It's attempted imposition in this case on a conceitedly truthful, non-obscene scientific book.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.170" offset="964002">In fact, a book length case history of a cause of cycle therapeutic treatment which is more than 10 years over is most decidedly a case of first impression.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.707" offset="1002245">The booking question has more than 1,000 pages, 17,016 footnotes.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.784" offset="1022516">The least price is $20.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.975" offset="1031293">The original print order was to $3,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.287" offset="1040488">In the three months that was on sale prior to the injunction, approximately 200 copies were sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.402" offset="1064939">The subject of the book is the treatment of a man and wife, both diagnosed as Schizophrenics without drug or shock therapy.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.014" offset="1095450">The form is a transcription of approximately one fifth of the psychiatrist session notes with copious footnotes written by the psychiatrist.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.269" offset="1132440">The therapy is more than 10 years completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.329" offset="1144665">It was commenced in 1956, 18 years ago and terminated in 1963, 11 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.053" offset="1171623">The book was published in February of 1973.Defendants are a psychiatrist, her husband, a lay therapist, and a small publishing house.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.573" offset="1205687">The plaintiff is a former patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.863" offset="1214777">The other individual subject of the book is the patient's former husband, now deceased, but divorced with plaintiff prior to his demeanors.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.868" offset="1246856">His widow, who is also claimed by plaintiff to be identifiable in the book did not join plaintiff in this action.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.838" offset="1446745">It is unusual but it happens occasionally.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.686" offset="1474121">And there is no absolute right to it and we sight a case in our brief which indicates that it's within the discretion of the justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.241" offset="1516335">What's more, he made the following observation, findings and statements within incomprehensively, inconsistent with his conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.172" offset="1552071">Namely, that it is a well-established practice in the medical profession and in the public interest for a physician to publish case histories.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.423" offset="1581014">This being a tradition started by Doctor Freud.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.047" offset="1591568">Indeed, the only citation of authority in the opinion with special term is a citation to Doctor Freud.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.313" offset="1620616">Also an observation, scientific value of the book is not a fit subject for judicial evaluation.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.710" offset="1642245">Also, the statements that defendants taken steps to disguise, which I read to the Court and respond for the Chief Justice's question, and with respect to the many examples, 34 number of claimed identification given by plaintiff and her moving affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.526" offset="1701491">It was not a sentence of all testimony or cross-examination on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.164" offset="1719986">The Court found, I do not think they were really identified plaintiff as the patient to someone who did not already know that plaintiff was the patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.069" offset="1755617">I respectfully submit that by the use of this double negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.065" offset="1771604">The special term, it is eliminated any possible finding of general identifiable and he found a mere possibility of the identifiable limited to an obviously small and discrete number of persons who met all the following requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.259" offset="1828446">This must be persons who know the plaintiff and who know of the existence of the doctor and who know now, now mind you in 1973 and 1974, the plaintiff and the doctor had a doctor-patient relationship that ended more than 10 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.048" offset="1891558">And even there, Justice Silverman merely speculated that those might be the only ones or that the only ones whom might be able to know would be persons who would be within that discrete group.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.394" offset="1932936">I submit that the justice at special term and the appellant division, which affirm the Justice special term and the Court of Appeals, had an equal basis in the record for finding that normal standards of disguise for cases free publication were met and as much as plaintiffs were given false first names.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.966" offset="2007228">Plaintiffs were given no last names.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.009" offset="2015378">No location was indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.224" offset="2024260">The patient's family group was radically altered, fictionalized so as to make it appear that they had only one child when in fact they had two children.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.408" offset="2061040">The book was not published until 10 years post treatment and after the divorce and the death of the husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.696" offset="2086118">And all that plaintiff was able to produce in the three months between the publication and the injunction to support her claim of identifiability was a single affidavit of a friend which does not refer to even a single one of the 34 allegedly identifying characteristics, which plaintiff herself identified in her moving affidavit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1658.247" offset="6736332">Now, this doesn't involve the simple case of publication of the case history that is being enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.567" offset="6781680">What we have in this case is a patient's confidences divulge to her psychiatrist copied almost verbatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.424" offset="6829119">Notes made during each psychiatric session between the psychiatrist and her patient, who is the respondent in this case, and the patient's husband, and those notes written at lenght after the sessions and then made into a book and as I understand from the brief of the amicus in this case, the American Psychiatric Associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.664" offset="6966000">In these sessions, a patient is encouraged to dredge up from the unconscious thoughts that would never be expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.167" offset="7016051">Memories that had been too distressing to keep in mind and the like, and all these were written down, where a vote by the psychiatrist questions, were then written down and then publish and they relate to such matters as the patient's thoughts during intercourse, her husband's masturbation, her own masturbation, her fantasies about incest, then the like, all these then published in a book and retailed in and discount houses, department stores, trade bookstores even music stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.860" offset="7222836">This is the kind of book and this is the problem that we have here today and this is again just not a case history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.135" offset="7251884">I can't imagine the situation in which there has been a greater assault on a persons dignity, on a person's self respect to have these thoughts said out for one's neighbors, for one's children, for one's students to read because patient here is an assistant professor in the university.</text>

            <text syncTime="1849.725" offset="7502242">Oh, it's a statement made which we haven't verified as yet, and I'm going to come to this question of the status of the case and why we are so little advance and why a year and half had past since the preliminary injunction was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.444" offset="7585102">Now, the first preliminary injunction on this case was an injunction which prevented the sale only in the trade stores and the department stores, and in the discount houses put a large sale, in medical schools, in libraries who dealt with scientific books and the like, and as soon as that injunction was issue the limited injunction was issued we representing the patient wrote a letter to the Court saying we would like an immediate trial and we suggest that the Court allow ten days for pretrial examination, pretrial discovery before the full trial starts and we receive no response, that letter is that A91 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.028" offset="7811532">We received no response, the order or the injunction, the limited injunction was slightly modified and the case was assigned to a judge for all purposes including trial and we wrote that judge and we said, “May we have an immediate trial?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.876" offset="7910902">And the attorney for the psychiatrist wrote back and said, “We don't join in that application, as a matter of fact we probably we'll appeal,” and this is a very complicated case and we want our learned pretrial examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.939" offset="7979133">Now of course, the appeals were taken, so that it wouldn't been difficult to have at trial, and New York state could have been secured without any difficulty I think your Honor, Mr. Justice Stewart asked that question before and a state would be issued on appeal, the state of the trial of the question of the right to injunction were challenged.</text>

            <text syncTime="2007.407" offset="8133047">I think it would have been necessary to apply to the Appellate Court for stay but those stays are automatically granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.060" offset="8163662">As indeed, they should be if there is a real question to be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.623" offset="8193860">But now, coming back to this procedure here as I said when the case was assigned to a judge for trial and for all other purposes we again ask for the immediate trial and we again had the opposition of the psychiatrist here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.070" offset="8279646">And they said they had a law in pretrial examination and indeed, it occupied a longer period of time because of his completed only last week, exactly one week ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.370" offset="8340877">And we got it completed only by applying to the Court to compel that completion of the examination, but only the parts of six days and now according from the psychiatrist's brief, the reply brief only the parts of six days were taken over this year and half, that examination before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.606" offset="8437844">So that any delay or duration of this preliminary injunction is entirely the fault of the psychiatrist here and indeed, over the opposition of the patient, who wanted a quick trial on disposition of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.910" offset="8519032">Now, Mr. Karpatkin stated an answer to a question of Mr. Justice Stewart that if there were identification of the patient in this book, an injunction could issue at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.232" offset="8608266">And I think that virtually dispossess of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.359" offset="8628851">May I first tell you factually what the identification in the book is, the book does give fictitious names to the parties and says they are fictitious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.262" offset="8684440">But then goes on to give a great many details of the lives of these people indicates that the patient's husband was a professional speech writer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3411.567" offset="13749687">In New York State, preliminary injunction is merely an adjunct to the final injunction that may be granted or denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.864" offset="13794826">And it is a temporary order granted simply to be certain that if final relief is given to the plaintiff in the case, that final relief will not be meaningless, because if the temporary injunction was not granted we would have the sale of the book and it wouldn't have done us any good after a period of time to get the final injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.562" offset="13901615">Now, you did have evidence submitted by affidavit, you did have all argument briefs, all the requirements of due process are met, even the demand that a valid cause of action be proved before the injunction can be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.594" offset="13985729">There is—it was indicated before a right even to ask for an evidentiary hearing with respect to any crucial fact, any crucial disputed fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.277" offset="14036511">And Mr. Karpatkin's only complained about that right or about that section allowing a hearing on the disputed fact is that if he asked for it, the Court might have refused to give it to him, because the fact in this case are complex, they certainly aren't complex, they couldn't be simpler.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.036" offset="14135568">All that we have here is a simple problem of the book, the revelations in the book, and the problem of identification which I think is evident from the book itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="3540.180" offset="14264090">With respect to the presumption, it is evident that respondent's position is lost without the presumption, because it's evident that the basic finding in this case is the finding which was made by Mr. Justice Silverman, a special term, which has in fact and affirmed by the appellate division just modifying the relief granted there from, and also affirmed regrettably without opinion by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.575" offset="14365654">And the most that can be found from that finding I say is as Mr. Justice White observed is an implication but even there an implication which is insulated by a double negative.</text>
