            <label>Mr. Mason D. Morisset</label>
            <text syncTime="15.937" offset="167163">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.037" offset="183568">Antoine against State of Washington is here on appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.717" offset="210213">It involves the hunting rights of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Indian Reservation on the land which was sold by them to United States government in 1891, having been prior to that time, a part of their reservation as set aside by the President in 1872.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.028" offset="299447">The facts are fairly simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.901" offset="306970">Mr. Antoine and his wife Irene shot a deer, in the fall of 1971 on this land during a time in which hunting was closed by the laws of the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.531" offset="365484">The Colville Confederated Tribes and Mr. Antoine are of the opinion that their rights to hunt on that land were guaranteed by the 1891 Sale Agreement as ratified by the Congress and that the State of Washington has no right to stop them from hunting there whatsoever, or in the alternative if some right is found, the State can do so only upon a prior showing of necessity for conservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.612" offset="489827">Let me trace the chronology briefly of what happened on what we called the old north half of the Colville Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.368" offset="520861">This was the aboriginal home of various tribes and bands which now make up the Confederated Colville Tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.829" offset="550640">There was no treaty signed with these groups and bands but finally in 1872, the President set aside approximately three million acres of land as a reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.618" offset="601840">This is the 1872 Executive Order.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.157" offset="616051">Thereafter, the State of Washington, or what was then the territory of Washington was admitted to the union in 1889.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.720" offset="646248">In 1891, the Congress formed a Commission to go and in the words of the act, meet and treat with the Indians to buy and purchase whatever land they might wish to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.534" offset="701524">An agreement was reached to sell the North half of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.169" offset="720018">Approximately, one and half million acres running up to the Canadian border between the Okanogan and Columbia Rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.598" offset="757739">That agreement was not immediately ratified by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.960" offset="771218">Rather in 1892, the Congress passed an act which unilaterally took the land back. Subsequently, the Indians agitated and lobbied for the ratification of their agreement and the payment of the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.011" offset="831404">This was ultimately accomplished in 1906 by an Appropriation Act whereby the Congress to carry into effect the agreement, authorized the payment of money and thereafter, in subsequent appropriation acts, actually authorized the payment in $300,000 increment to the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.222" offset="912280">Now 1872 then, finds the vesting of hunting and fishing rights in this land in question by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.797" offset="946552">It was an Indian Reservation with all the rights that go along with that, the right to exclude non-Indians from that land, the right to fish and hunt without control by the Territorial or State Government and all the many other rights which this Court knows attend a reservation status.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.874" offset="1026905">In 1891, the Indians agreed to surrender and relinquish all rights entitled to the land, but they reserved many rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.084" offset="1075702">They reserved, for example, allotments in this area and to this day, many members of the tribes still live on their allotments on this sold land.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.726" offset="1114258">They reserve the right to the use of the water and water courses attended to those allotments and they reserved, in Section 6 of the agreement, that the right to fish and hunt shall not be taken away or in any ways abridged.</text>

            <text syncTime="735.905" offset="3047006">Now that's -- that's a difficult fact question because it differs from reservation to reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.777" offset="3066441">But in most cases, the Bureau of Indian Affairs or in the early years, the war department carried out some kind of survey and many of these reservation lands have government, special government plats.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.485" offset="3113357">They don't exist in the archive, because I have tried to dig them up and they will be alloted by a lot number and they will have an allotment number 141, and you have to go to an original government plat to find, what that means and sometimes, that will be a map or it will be meats and bounds and in some occasion, it differs greatly.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.089" offset="3211682">Now I was –- I believe discussing the 1891 agreement and noting that the Indians had to lobby for sometime before the agreement was carried into effect, approximatively 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.209" offset="3280227">In 1906, the Congress did ratify the agreement, appropriate the money to carried into effect and the money was gradually paid out over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.675" offset="3322023">Now the affected agreement to these appellants that their hunting and fishing rights are guaranteed by Supreme Federal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.320" offset="3360684">The State seems to argue that this agreement is not Supreme Federal Law, and the State Court in Washington, seemed to hold that.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.088" offset="3399764">I find no support for that in any of the learning and teachings of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.410" offset="3420975">Certainly the Congress has plenary power over Indian Tribes and has exercised that power through the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.996" offset="3447306">Certainly at the time, that the promise was made, this was Federal land.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.755" offset="3466428">In fact, the whole area was a territory, the whole area was federal land and the particular area in question, the North half of the reservation was even more federal than the whole territory, if that's possible because it was an Indian Reservation and the Federal government had full authority and control over that land as trustee for the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.084" offset="3551692">So the two owners of the land; the government as the fee owner, and the Indians as the beneficial owner, agreed as to how it would be sold and what the terms would be and the Federal Government promised that hunting and fishing rights would continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.469" offset="3617207">Now the Federal Government has done this before, in other cases that have come before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.323" offset="3640613">Dick versus U.S. for example, involved the sale of land by a tribe of their reservation back to the government and the government agreed in the document, that Federal Liquor Laws would continue to apply not withstanding incorporation of those areas into the State thereafter and this Court held that of course, the Federal Government could do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.084" offset="3731728">It could take land back from the Indians and apply conditions to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.251" offset="3760358">Our position then is that the Indians and the Federal Government agreed as to what the terms would be of ceding the land back to the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.277" offset="3804453">And that the State of Washington had to take whatever power or jurisdiction or authority they have over that land, subject to outstanding Federal promises, just as same as when they became a State in 1889, most of the land at that time was tied up in some sort of Federal ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.361" offset="3888776">Now, getting to the words of the agreement itself, as ratified by the Congress, it's our position that the words shall not be taken away or in anywise be abridged mean that the State has no authority whatsoever to regulate Indian hunting and fishing on that north half.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.087" offset="3979682">They took or became a state, subject to the outstanding promise of the Federal Government, and it is for the Federal Government and the Indians to decide how hunting and fishing rights will be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.620" offset="4041853">We believe that this case is unlike the Puyallup litigation that this Court has had to struggle with, as had the State courts in Washington for many years now.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.008" offset="4083440">Unlike it because the words of the agreement read as an absolute promise, they are much stronger in the Steven's Treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.103" offset="4115832">This Court has had to struggle with the Steven's Treaties which promised the right to hunt and fish in common with other citizens of the territory, and that's all the treaty say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.094" offset="4155747">In this situation, the Federal Agreement, the Supreme Law of the land says the right to hunt and fish in common with other citizens of the United States, shall not be taken away or in anywise abridged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.994" offset="4203395">We feel it is an abridgment, an impairment and aggregation of those rights if the State is allowed any jurisdiction or authority whatsoever to regulate Indian hunting and fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.685" offset="4262118">We believe that a holding would be consistent through this Court's teaching as to the need for Indian Tribes to govern themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.160" offset="4292002">This Court has held that hunting and fishing rights are a Tribal right to be exercised by the individual Indians and we believe that the Colville Confederated Tribes can and will regulate this tribal right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1329.272" offset="5420492">I want to make it clear however, that these rights, these Hunting and Fishing Rights attached, when the reservation was established, and it has been the teaching of this court that such rights do not fly away or disappear by implication, by some strange metaphysical happening in an Act of Congress and the only Act of Congress or only action of Congress which refers to the rights at all is the 1891 agreement and that could be -- and of course, preserves the rights, it does not take them away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.912" offset="5559045">The 1892 Act makes no mention of the rights whatsoever and I believe it's the teaching in this court in Menomonie, for example, that if no mention are made of hunting and fishing rights, which are vested in a tribe and then they are not impaired or abrogated or taken away and that's a good teaching and I would hope that we could stand by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.709" offset="5658206">So, our position to summarize is that the promise absolute in its terms, does not gives the State any power or control whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="1416.782" offset="5770533">They have done none of the steps that the trial courts which have had to try to implement your decisions in Puyallup to come up with, such as looking into the regulation ahead of time, considering the Indian needs as a special need and making special provision for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.593" offset="5833749">The State has done nothing of that kind in this case and I think, it would be clear that, this particular regulation which Alexander Antoine is considered to have violated was not done as necessary for conservation as that term has come to me in terms of Indian rights, but was done as a total State political allocation regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1926.695" offset="7810173">They are fully subject to State taxation and even if the owner of those lands would engage in the activity of hunting, he would required to possess a state hunting license.</text>

            <text syncTime="1942.887" offset="7874957">Yes that is correct, and the owner of the land would likewise have to comply with that hunting season regulation which was promulgated by the Game Commission of the State of Washington pursuant to statutory delegation by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.559" offset="7941622">The first point that I believe should be briefly discussed involves the 1871 statute prohibiting the execution of further treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.094" offset="7983731">And in light of this statute, I believe that the Court must examine very carefully the legal consequences which might arguably flow from the 1891 agreement with the tribes and bands of Colville Indian Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.294" offset="8044544">I would first point out to the Court, that as pointed out by the court below, that a plausible interpretation of the exact language before the court in Articles 1, 5, 6 of the 1891 agreement is that, Article 6 was intended to secure to the Indian allottees in the Northern half, the rights to go upon the Indian Reservation and hunt in common with the Indians on the diminished or South half of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.007" offset="8159378">This is further borne out by the exact language used by the Commissioners who represented the United States when entering into these negotiations in Article 1, whereby the Indians “do hereby surrender and relinquish to the United States all their right, titles, claim and interest in and to and over the following described tract of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.127" offset="8259897">Secondly, as pointed out in the briefs filed by the United States as amicus curiae, and in the statutes pointed out by the Appellants in their briefs, there is no showing in this record that the Commissioners of the United States had any authority to enter into a treaty or even that, that was what they intended to accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.268" offset="8356446">Rather it would -- the statute authorizing the Commissioners to enter into these negotiations indicate that their purpose was to acquire the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.929" offset="8399078">So, that it might be open for public settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.302" offset="8412557">This matter was further brought to the attention of Congress as is pointed out in the memorandums, which ultimately culminated in the 1892 statute, which is found at 27 Statutes at large page 62 and following.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.181" offset="8476087">It is the State's position that the 1892 Statute confers jurisdiction upon the state and that it expressly purports to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.851" offset="8510777">In this connection, I would further point out to the Court that the legislative history surrounding the enactment of the 1892 statue, clearly demonstrates that Congress had before it the precise question of whether or not to ratify the 1891 Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.010" offset="8579427">In fact, the House of Representatives did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.541" offset="8597504">The Senate did not concur and the matter finally culminated in the exact language of the 1892 Statue, which because the critical nature of the state's position on the reliance upon the statute, I would like to just very briefly read the precise language employed by Congress, remembering that the proposed inclusion of a reservation of fishing and hunting rights, the House version was rejected by the Senate in favor of this language which finally did pass Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.122" offset="8739819">The statute provides that the northern half be and is hereby, vacated and restored to the public domain, notwithstanding any executive order or other proceeding whereby the same was set apart as a reservation for any Indians or bands of Indians and the same shall be open to settlement and entry by proclamation of the President of the United States and shall be disposed of under the general laws applicable to the disposition of public lands in the State of Washington.</text>

            <text syncTime="2389.539" offset="9661524">I would further, in support, I am on this subject generally of ratification Mr. Justice Stewart, I'd like to further respond to your queries by pointing out that the precise language employed by Congress in the 1906 Appropriation Act itself states that it's purpose was to authorize payment to the Indians in order to carry into effect the agreement of 1891.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.576" offset="9773641">And the exact language employed by Congress I would submit, would support the conclusion that it was Congressional, that it demonstrates Congressional intentions simply to pay for the lands acquired</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.990" offset="9827349">I'd further submit that the language cited by the Federal governing in their amicus brief, the comments of Justice Fullerton, former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the State of Washington, who was one of the commissioners who dealt with the Colville Indians, dealt solely with the question of obtaining compensation from Congress for the payment, for the taking, if you will, or the opening of these northern half lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.993" offset="9951378">It is our position that the any -- the the subsequent 1906 and following appropriation acts which are set forth in our memorandum, our brief, do not purport to ratify in the Constitutional sense of ratification, in the 1891 agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.701" offset="10022222">That it is our position that similar to the position interestingly taken by the Department of Interior, when these matters were called to Congress' attention in 1906 that the Indian simply had a -- that Indian's did have a possessory right to the northern half and that they should be compensated for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.997" offset="10095365">The reason apparently, that Congress was dragging it's feet was that they weren't sure as to whether the Indians even had a possessory interest in the northern half of the reservation due to the fact it was created pursuing to an executive order and not pursuing to treaty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2516.223" offset="10168299">Yes, the reading of the legislative history in that regard would seem to me it lead to that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.525" offset="10213439">I would further point out that the 1892 statute which ceded jurisdiction clearly, in our view to the State of Washington, has never been modified or repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.804" offset="10262549">And in this connection I would point out that the Constitution of United States, Article 1, Section 8, Clause 16, provides that the jurisdiction of a State, once acquired can only be retroceded with a consent of the State Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.056" offset="10331617">And there is not showing in this record and in fact the legislature has not in -- purported to retrocede to the Federal Government jurisdiction over the northern half.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.924" offset="10383026">In fact, what appellants seem to be arguing is that the State should be deprived of the jurisdiction which it acquired in 1892, by implication from an agreement executed for the purchase of the lands with the Indian tribes in 1891.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.801" offset="10462542">We would submit that a State should not be deprived of it's jurisdiction to it's to enforce it's laws upon all citizens equally, upon the lands in question i.e. the former northern half, upon such a showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.817" offset="10522624">The prior decisions of this Court appear to be quite uniform in articulating this rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.536" offset="10553553">I would further point out that the suggestion which is made in both the Federal Government amicus brief and in the brief of appellants, that Public Law 280, somehow comes into play, in this case is spurious.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph Lawrence Coniff, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2630.146" offset="10623979">Public Law 280, which is the state's assumption of jurisdiction over Indian reservations, it was enacted by Congress in 1953, became effective in August, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.441" offset="10685106">Our position simply is that Public Law 280 does not apply because, “the northern half was not an Indian reservation” as of the date of it's enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.835" offset="10730663">Therefore by it's terms, it does not apply to the northern, the extinguished northern half of the Colville Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.434" offset="10769115">And therefore the Menominee decision of this Court, the companion case to Puyallup I simply does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.279" offset="10804537">Menominee of course dealt with the express termination of a treaty tribe and of course the situation is dramatically different here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.758" offset="10842363">Where in other words, the Indian country concept in this opinion written by Justice Douglas, the Indian country concept was clearly set forth that the lands must occupy their unique status as Indian county and Indian reservation in order at the time of the enactment of Public Law 280 in order for it's terms to be applicable and the Court in the unanimous opinion was very careful to make that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.064" offset="10967646">I'd like to further point out that in subsequent Congressional treatment of the northern half, the extinguished northern half of the Colville Indian Reservation has uniformly dealt with it, as if it were extinguished, the precise Congressional statutes are set forth in our memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.239" offset="11056358">This subsequent Congressional treatment is reflected in several opinions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.784" offset="11086555">I'd specifically refer to Court to United States versus Pelican which is found in 232 U.S and I am reading at page 446, a very short sentence which I believe is on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.039" offset="11143502">In dealing with the question of the northern half, the evident purpose of Congress was to carve out, of the portion of the reservation restored to the public domain, the lands to be alloted and reserved as stated and to make the restoration effective only as to the, the vacation and restoration which the statute accomplished Section 1, was thus so forth made subject to the reservation and allotments of land in severalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.017" offset="11255411">Now, as I have mentioned the stipulated facts, facts that were stipulated by Mr. Morisset and I at the original trial of this matter in Republic Washington indicate that the offense occurred on non allotted, non-Indian lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.659" offset="11318000">So, that we are not dealing with an allotment remaining in the northern half in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2892.283" offset="11672534">As the Court is aware the original boundaries extended to the 49th parallel, bounded with the nation of Canada.</text>

            <text syncTime="2955.323" offset="11924668">This is might logic, if I get respond just very briefly to their argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.679" offset="11942118">Their position appears to be that to the extent that the extinguished northern half is a National Forest, that the Indians at least have this much room or this much at least free from any state jurisdiction or state authority to apply the hunting laws in the question and I would submit that this position is erroneous for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.623" offset="12053817">First of all as I have previously indicated the locus delicti is not within National Forest boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.275" offset="12092479">Secondly, the establishment of National Forest occurred after the acceptance of jurisdiction, by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.615" offset="12133857">It's pointed out, that Colville National Forest was established by presidential proclamation in 1907, and further the statutes by which the National Forest of the United States are established are set forth in page 3 of the Orange Reply Brief indicate that the jurisdiction, both civil and criminal over persons within such National Forests shall not be affected or changed by reason of the existence of such reservations and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.021" offset="12275440">It says that the State or in any such National Forest situated shall not, by reason of the establishment thereof, lose it's jurisdiction nor the inhabitants thereof their rights and privileges as citizens of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.936" offset="12331133">This is as presently quantified in 16 USC 480 and has been construed definitively by this Court in Wilson versus Cook, which is set forth in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.477" offset="12377318">The Federal Government likewise appears to argue and as do the appellants that somehow the Indians were nearby a National Forest and were somehow acting pursuant to some sort of federal statutory authority enjoyed by representatives of the Department of Interior or the National Forest Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.005" offset="12463417">The case authority cited in support for this proposition in our view does not apply to the case at bar.</text>

            <text syncTime="3239.629" offset="13061935">In 1892, the size of this reservation was diminished when Congress passed an act providing that subject to reservations and allotments made to individual Colville Indians about one-half of the original Colville in reservation since commonly referred to as the north half should be vacated and restored to the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.407" offset="13141034">The Court goes on to observe that this act didn't however, purport to effect the status of the remaining part of the reservation since known as the south half.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.432" offset="13181053">Finally, in this same vein, I'd like to refer to Mattz versus Arnett decision which was written by Justice Blackmun in October term 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.649" offset="13241971">We read from page, very briefly from page 412 US at page 504, Footnote 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.527" offset="13273527">Here the Court unanimously was reaching a conclusion with that the Hupa and Yurok Indians of California, that their reservations in the Court are along the river between the two have never been expressly dealt with or terminated by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.334" offset="13340714">And in reaching this conclusion the Court contrasted, made the point that where Congress desired to specifically extinguish or to terminate an Indian reservation it clearly was capable of doing so with express language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.364" offset="13400795">And in support of that proposition the Court states unanimously that Congress has used clear language of express termination when that result is desired.</text>

            <text syncTime="3561.653" offset="14349981">Secondly, if it should come to that, I think there is a point at which the Indian is not engaged in hunting, as it was contemplated by the agreement and it is contemplated today, by hunting statues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.474" offset="14401285">A person or a white man can be hunting, have a license, be within State Law, but if he goes too far and runs into some other police power law, he can still be found guilty of that and I think the same principle would apply here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3602.838" offset="14514761">I think that an Indian would be bound not to shoot across a public highway in the exercise of his hunting rights because the state there is not trying to stop him from hunting per se, is not allocating the resources as it is trying to do here, is trying to preserve the public peace and if he insists on shooting across a public highway that really isn't hunting as it was guaranteed by this agreement.</text>
