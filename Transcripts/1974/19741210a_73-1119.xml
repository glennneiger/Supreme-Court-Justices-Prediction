            <text syncTime="37.951" offset="255143">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.690" offset="266115">I think this case is a little different from the one you just heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.043" offset="287535">In this case, there was an action brought by Mr. Jenkins who as an Assistant City Attorney in the City of Birmingham in Equity court seeking to permanently enjoin the maintenance of a nuisance at the Pussycat Adult Theater and a Bookstore.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.318" offset="380635">The State of Alabama unlike the State of Ohio was proceeding under the Red Light Abatement Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.515" offset="417416">There was no provision for a one year closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.687" offset="430164">There was no maximum or minimum set.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.635" offset="441866">This was simply and purely going under the Red Light Abatement Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.928" offset="463078">The proof in this case was adduced by Mr. Jenkins was that, certain people who worked for the corporation had been convicted in the Recorder's Court which is the first level of court for violation of the obscenity laws of the City of the Birmingham.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.145" offset="551999">They have a city ordinance for violation of obscenity laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.518" offset="565478">There were approximately 15 cases which have been made most of which have been tried before the Recorder's Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.789" offset="606542">All of which had been appealed at the -- or were in the process of being appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.020" offset="631411">Since that time, the only three cases with the appeal Your Honors goes to de novo to the next court -- Circuit Court and which there is a jury trial on issue of obscenity and parenthetically speaking the only three cases are going to trial all resulted in acquittals for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.928" offset="707062">But yet, it was this evidence of the violation of the -- alleged violation of the law before the Recorder's Court and instead of the other 12 that were still pending and have not yet been tried in the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.653" offset="757948">So, every -- what we have is the evidence of convictions that the lowest court when appeals were allowable in the next level with the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.550" offset="801520">That was the criminal process, what the prosecution or what Mr. Jenkins tried to do here was a civil proceeding and a purely civil proceeding which is not ipso facto or necessarily ancillary to the enforcement of the criminal laws because the criminal laws were proceeding and the rational is proceeding in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.320" offset="892635">But what he did is attempt to go in and to close up the theater because yesterday they sold obscene books or films which they exhibited and tomorrow you may do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="363.861" offset="1558862">Yes sir, much like our -- I think Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure kind of thing where an attempt is made to notify the other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.071" offset="1587702">Now, in the -- what counsel then did on behalf of MTM and the other plaintiff is to file an action in federal court prior to the issuance of the temporary restraining order and which it asked for the convocation of three-judge court to determine constitutionality of the utilization of the Red Light Statute either as written or as applied by the prosecutor in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.104" offset="1711835">The -- there was a co-defendant, I'm sorry -- a co-plaintiff separate case entirely different by the name of General Corporation which had faced the same problem and I think some Huntsville, Alabama and in that case, they also were closed by court order and the three-judge federal court joined both cases for the purpose of argument and disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.738" offset="1838373">And thus, the decision in essence applies to both sets of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.891" offset="1866898">Again, parenthetically speaking we proceeded remaining the MTM and the other corporation operating the theater and bookstore preceded by following a jurisdictional statement and sought to seek the relief for this Court from the denial of the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.101" offset="1931786">The other corporation -- General Corporation decided to go forward in the state courts after the three-judge court threw them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.557" offset="1965641">When they did so in spite of the comment by Judge Pointer in his decision that there is a procedure in Alabama where you can sort of expedite your -- that's on page A-99 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.211" offset="2044217">He said that in Alabama permanent injunctions are appealable and temporary injunctions may be made appealable by appropriate motions and both types of appeals are given expedited preferential treatment by statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1195.690" offset="4886131">There have been several comments made in Mr. Smith's presentation that are misrepresentative of the procedures that occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.906" offset="4926986">I don't know where it -- I don't believe they are intentional but for one thing, first thing they did out file the injunction procedure in the Circuit Court on March the 7th and set up the hearing for March 13th and gave them notice of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.150" offset="5007966">In the next day or the morning of the hearing, their local counsel was in the federal courts securing a -- filing a removal petition and he came to the hearing and with the bond order-- the removal order and present it to the circuit judge who for some reason I forgot to take in the county wouldn't accept it but I had to go back to the court and get that perfected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.708" offset="5126248">In the meantime, he said that we're going to have a hearing and we have the hearing and while he was over that getting a thing removed and so they did remove and I filed a motion to remand immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.162" offset="5180061">And we had a hearing on that and got the case remanded to the Circuit Court and proceeded to set another hearing that we were going to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.364" offset="5228857">And in the meantime they filed this present action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.976" offset="5247248">It involved -- there was already a pending another case as he talked about that is on appeal and it was argued at the Alabama Supreme Court which was separate from this case the City of Huntsville case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.513" offset="5297403">And they had already been filed another case by Earl Morgan, the District Attorney of Jefferson County in a separate case which involved the Mobile Bookmart which is a store -- bookstore located downtown across the street from the federal building.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.368" offset="5356857">This theater that I filed an injunction against is located in eastern section City of Birmingham and contains in the front of little bookstore in addition to the theater and that's operated by MTM Incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.710" offset="5418193">This whole title of the case got switched around, the other party -- the Huntsville case did not appeal from the three-judge court order in this case electing to go ahead and perfect their appeal in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.460" offset="5485171">In this case was appealed Mr. -- Attorney General Baxley was named because he is required to have notice in this type of actions and Earl Morgan was named because he is the party from those relations in this case was filed on behalf of the bookstore downtown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.404" offset="5561031">In that case, there was a motion to -- they removed that case also for the federal court and there was a motion filed to remand in that case which was never ruled upon because this hearing -- this case was filed in a consolidated and immediately all three of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.104" offset="5635741">And on the basis of this jurisdictional question of whether or not the federal court could intervene in the matter and set it down for hearing in due course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.153" offset="5671999">Now, it's very complicated, the record is not here before the Court as to what exactly happened and of course, I guess they consider this particular narrow question of whether the Younger versus Harris principle applied in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.931" offset="5735111">It wouldn't be necessary but in order that this Court might consider this principle of Younger versus Harris whether or not it involves the criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.517" offset="5785475">I would like to state that the -- in my complaint, he made a statement that there were some 15 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.740" offset="5814314">But on the contrary, we began this matter when the theater opened in September of 1970 and it went to March of 1973 when the injunction in this Circuit Court was issued and up to that time they showed something like a 125 to 130 movies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.044" offset="5919535">And which everyone was named in my complaint before the Circuit Court and it was made in exhibit to their complaint in the federal court and started per date except for about two months when the newspapers refused to take advertisements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.621" offset="5985886">But in disperse out of the internet time over 125 or 130-week period we made 30 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.415" offset="6029040">Some was kept a few weeks but they were in dispersed between the whole period of time of 130 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.837" offset="6054745">Some might they may go five weeks and some a month but we did get a good sampling of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.918" offset="6099048">Amd some of the titles were -- the Ranch and Interstellar, Sex and Single Vampire, Jim and Peg, The Other of the Bed, Class of '69, Dollars of Satan, Miles Falls in love, Harvey Swings, Bitter Cherry, Flash to Flash, I'll do Everything, Lolita's Lollipop, Man Blower, Sandra Bowler, Lowly Housewife, and so on and including the ones 30 cases we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.802" offset="6198627">Now, those 30 cases there were 30 convictions in Recorder's Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.115" offset="6219839">All of which were appealed to Circuit Court to the criminal division for trial de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.183" offset="6244080">Now, of those 30, there are 18 cases that were tried and they were reconviction in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.673" offset="6266023">There are some -- the rest of them are still pending except for three cases that he mentioned which did result in acquittal of the defendant just recently which of course I could explain to the Court but it's a the jury returned one verdict in case said it -- they were reluctant in and found them not guilty because of the Rulings of the Supreme Court of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1909.763" offset="7742464">So it would not be in effect after six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.725" offset="7762317">So, in the District Court, three-judge court was appointed and the matter was taken under advice on us to Younger versus Harris principle is being applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.581" offset="7805680">And we argued in brief that it was a quasi-criminal matter that it was in aid of the criminal statute -- the nuisance statute that I have mentioned under which it was proceeded on the procedure, it was instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.861" offset="7878823">And the three-judge court ruled that it was on the basis of several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.437" offset="7909125">They talked about Mitchum versus Foster and said that they required irreparable injury or unusual circumstances which didn't exist in this case and they stated that in the order, that's in the appendix that he referred to previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.870" offset="7970879">And stated in fact that this case did not involve and I think it surmise it to the ordinary circumstance in here in this particular type of proceeding, that's the nuisance that is going to involve loss of profit and those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.515" offset="8061471">But the court deemed this to be an action in the nature of a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.365" offset="8088848">Of course the ruling that are residing for several Fifth Circuit case is mainly the one of Duke versus Texas, 477 F.2d and which the Fifth Circuit told that court that applications of the principles of Supreme Court as Younger versus Harris decision involved in the matter of the federal court enjoining a state court proceeding should not depend upon such labels or civil or criminal but rather it should be governed by analysis of the competing interest that each case presents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.329" offset="8240671">And so, that is that the Younger principles of equity come in federalism applied to federal intervention in state civil as well as criminal proceedings even where they exercise the First Amendment rights is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.869" offset="8302843">So, the question that has been raised here several times this afternoon on regarding the application of the Younger versus Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.869" offset="8354879">I think it's pretty well covered in the order by the Fifth Circuit and in those cases cited and I adopt that argument and I supported and I think that the facts of this case indicate that if we don't have some kind of a stop to people running to the federal court in this particular instances that we're in a fact being precluded from stopping any kind of pornography because as indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.255" offset="8484342">They showed this films over two-and-a-half year period and we undertook as much prosecution as we could and they wanted us to resort to individual prosecutions in each case where obscenity occurred which we did and it's voluminous, it's tedious, it's weary and it's exasperating --</text>

            <text syncTime="2175.778" offset="8806484">In that, I did not act ultra vires, I had the authority to do what I did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.144" offset="8835950">Its -- Its fact, it says that I shall do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.946" offset="8851205">One of the reasons we didn't do it sooner it was because of this case has came up before Miller and some were afraid at that time that this Court not render the opinion making pornography legal for consenting adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.598" offset="8925811">They operate this theater within those that limit that is advertised for adults only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.672" offset="8970010">And another -- and also that if it's unconstitutionality that our questioning in such an action they must state that they have illegal right, illegal protective right which is being denied by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.915" offset="9039078">In this case, if the pornography is illegal, as I believe it is, then the ordinance that the statute has been held in 80 Drive-In Theatres versus Baxley and the state case that I cited in to go holding that this -- by the State of Alabama that this is quasi-criminal matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.352" offset="9204799">Then, it's not an unconstitutional statute, it's merely one that they claimed and may have been but applied unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.137" offset="9255894">And also, in attempt to avoid the state form from deciding the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.841" offset="9282748">So, if this is a state matter, the state is not a person under Section 1983 and they would have to jump those two hurdles to get out from under that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.662" offset="9329977">So I think that we're not really a proper part anyway and that we should been dismissed even on that ground, but the Kenosha versus Bruno case held was municipality case but it did hold that in this equity relief, our damages would be applicable to state or subdivision, I mean to municipality and I think that that also includes the state county or municipality or the reason it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.775" offset="9462471">And so, the equity relief that they're seeking even though they are not seeking damages would be improper against the State of Alabama.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herbert Jenkins, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2374.417" offset="9601024">And I -- I read, I just merely -- I alternate is an alternative to some extent to show that I think that of course I realize that state officials can be sued but I was trying to say that it was -- well, action against the state and not myself and that should -- could be consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.844" offset="9706768">But the title of that Act is not a Red Light Act someone had mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.826" offset="9726725">I did want to clarify that it's a -- the title of it is Abatement of Certain Nuisances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.460" offset="9765177">They defined the nuisance as a place upon which as defined above upon which lewdness, assignation or prostitution is conducted, permitted, or continued, or exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.786" offset="9822542">So it's not just that and definition of lewdness has been held to be, it's none as I believe with the obscenity and it's the word broader than assignation and prostitution, and involves open in public indecency and includes I think obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.334" offset="9904671">So, I think its action was properly brought and is a quasi-criminal matter and the principles of Younger versus Harris do applied to it.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>

            <label>Mr. Robert Eugene Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="2467.008" offset="9971440">Alright sir, thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.000" offset="9979382">I'll only take about three.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.892" offset="9986905">The counsel referred to the decision of 80 Drive-in, Inc. versus Baxley, this was the decision of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.010" offset="10023372">It's in the brief 468, F.2d 611.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.609" offset="10037791">In that case, the federal court -- Fifth Circuit held that the state has a right to use its nuisance law -- public nuisance law and a manner to where here there was drive-in theater, it was showing X-rated films, there were traffic problems being created and in that specific instance much like I think the case crime in Rabe from the State of Washington, Rabe versus Washington where Mr. Chief Justice Burger, I think pointed out that that could be a special problem that might be resolved by nuisance actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.922" offset="10195048">That is not involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.926" offset="10199124">We have theater it's closed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2525.646" offset="10205915">The country wasn't confined to the traffic aspect?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Eugene Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="2528.157" offset="10216051">I know sir, there're young people going by and of course the same thing would be necessary true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.454" offset="10233187">So, I don't think that this decision of 80 Drive-in Inc. versus Baxley and I was referring to the Court's concurring opinion and there where you talked I believe about the fact that this could be dealt and might be dealt with this nuisance and I think that's what that decision holds for and I don't think it's applicable to the case here at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.103" offset="10311764">Secondly, I understand from Mr. -- from counsel that there has been no stipulation entered into by the parties that the judge on his motion Judge Barbour on his motion has continued the hearing or any permanent injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.918" offset="10367039">We are not going to ask for it unless we be usurp from our federal court jurisdiction and I suppose the prosecution is not asked for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.682" offset="10398072">And we suggest in final conclusion that the Court dismissed our case and we feel that if they felt that the State Supreme Court should rule on the matter abstention and they abstained then they should've retained jurisdiction under the theory of law but this Court has espoused including more recently American Trial Lawyers Association versus the New Jersey Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.592" offset="10493785">We think the Court erred absolutely flat out dismissing the case and should have retained jurisdiction.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="2601.441" offset="10509145">Well, doesn't -- doesn't England type of abstention for a state law question mean retention of jurisdiction but Younger versus Harris has meant dismissal, hasn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_eugene_smith" startTime="2612.926" stopTime="2660.133">
            <label>Mr. Robert Eugene Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="2612.926" offset="10555120">Yes, but if the Court if you will remember the opinion of the judge they suggested and it was a mixed bag that in this instance we have not gotten to a Younger versus Harris problem but we hadn't got into the special circumstances there because the state court could construe the statute in a manner which would take the federal constitutional question out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.967" offset="10639235">And if it did that, then the special circumstances in Younger v. Harris are not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.710" offset="10658252">So, that's why I'm saying it is relevant and that's the point I was making that I felt that under those circumstances then this is not -- they were not deciding it on pure Younger grounds and I think under this circumstance, they should retain jurisdiction even if not dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.987" offset="10731290">Thank you, Your Honors, and may have the Friday then to respond to the Court's latest decision?</text>
