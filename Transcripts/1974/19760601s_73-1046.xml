            <text syncTime="23.794" offset="178166">In 73-1046, the case involves a challenge to the constitutionality of a portion of the Social Security Act, which makes resident aliens who are over 65, ineligible for participation in a medical insurance program unless they have been admitted for permanent residence and also have resided in the United States for at least five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.642" offset="273565">A Three-Judge District Court sitting in the Southern District of Florida, held the statue unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.995" offset="299060">The case is here on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.699" offset="309823">As we point out in an opinion filed with the clerk, Congress, which has broad power over immigration and naturalization, has no constitutional duty to provide all aliens with the welfare benefits provided to citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.414" offset="364680">The real question in this case is not whether discrimination between aliens and citizens is permissible, but whether the statutory discrimination within the class of aliens is permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.205" offset="407834">We hold that the statutory requirements chosen by Congress which render eligible those aliens who may reasonably be assumed to have a greater affinity to the United Sates than those who are ineligible, is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.369" offset="464468">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the District Court.</text>
