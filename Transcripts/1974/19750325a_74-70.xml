            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text syncTime="64.783" offset="362454">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.667" offset="374053">In early 1962, the Committee on Economics of Law Practice of the Virginia State Bar issued its report on minimum fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.136" offset="415953">The opening sentence of that report neatly summarizes its intent and sets the background against which the activities of the respondents must be judged.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.504" offset="465377">“The lawyers have slowly but surely been committing economic suicide as a profession.”</text>
            <text syncTime="98.022" offset="495470">The remedy suggested by the State Bar, minimum fee schedules to be adopted by the local bars in the state, patterned on the suggested schedule contained in the State Bar's own fee report.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.033" offset="555551">Shortly thereafter, the respondent Fairfax County Bar Association, effective May 1, 1962 adopted its own fee schedule for the first time, essentially, the same fee schedules that suggested in the State Bar's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.771" offset="618454">That fee schedule continued in effect unchanged for a period of seven years until the Virginia State Bar once again issued another fee report by a similar committee to the one that issued the first one.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.985" offset="675297">This report reflected “a general scaling up of fees.”</text>
            <text syncTime="148.648" offset="697971">The report indicated it was necessary because of escalating costs and spiraling increase in the cost of living.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.314" offset="732662">The court -- the Committee acknowledged that there were substantial differences between some of the old schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.121" offset="755858">And the new fees for title examinations which are the services particularly at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.153" offset="779995">The title examination charge went to 1% of the purchase price of the home up to $50,000.00 and a half of 1% thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.526" offset="829524">We can read through the minimum fee schedule reports of the State Bar and the minimum fees schedules of the Fairfax Bar in vain to find a single reference to any protection of the public interest or the promotion of quality legal services at a reasonable cost, but there are indications of what these fees schedules and reports were intended to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.851" offset="926804">In 1962 report, the State Bar says that fees schedule should be promulgated because it is in the best interest of the Virginia State Bar and in 1969, the Fairfax report noted that the fee schedule will enhance the prestige of the State Bar, but the State Bar here was not content merely to publish its own fee reports and to allow the local bar associations to publish their own fee schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.613" offset="1037876">It wanted to put some teeth behind these fee schedules to be sure that they would be followed and so, it issued two ethical opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.142" offset="1067969">One, in 1960 and one in 1971, opinions number 98 and 170 and in substance these two fee opinions state that any attorney in Virginia who habitually charges less than the minimum fee schedule amount shall be presumed to have acted unethically and can be subject to discipline on proceedings brought by the Virginia State Bar in the state courts of Virginia.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.103" offset="1223764">However, I think it's also important to note that the record does show two other factors in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.595" offset="1249782">Number one; one of the attorneys to whom the Goldfarb's wrote suggested in its response to their letter about what kind of fees they could expect to pay that he felt that he was ethically required to adhere to the schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.762" offset="1302444">And it was also stipulated between the parties that the existence of these two opinions was a substantial influencing factor in the adherence found by the District Court to the fee schedules in Northern Virginia.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.626" offset="1361899">Is there any indication in that stipulation or any of the findings of the District Court as to whether this adherence came about because of a fear of disciplinary action or because of a desire to persuade the client that the fee had to be charged on a pecuniary motive basis?</text>

            <text syncTime="406.849" offset="1730748">They indeed wrote 36 letters to attorneys in Northern Virginia who had expressed interest in real state practice work.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.542" offset="1757497">They received 19 replies, none of which indicated a willingness to charge less and in almost every case, the reply was something to the effect that the fee is established by the Fairfax County Bar Association or I know none of my brethren who would charge any less and I feel that I'm ethically required to adhere to those charges.</text>

            <text syncTime="448.386" offset="1896887">First, the promulgation of the fee reports in 1962 which got the ball rolling in Northern Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.362" offset="1924786">And then, in 1969 when they effectuated the revision of the fee suggestion and I might point out Your Honor that in 1969, the increase in the minimum fee for title examination alone was an increase of 67%.</text>

            <text syncTime="630.336" offset="2624763">As I say I have discussed these matters relating the importance of the Virginia State Bar because two of the judges in this case, the District Court judge and the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals both suggested that the State Bar was immune because of what they termed the State Bar's minor role.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.411" offset="2689024">I think that any realistic assessment of this record inevitably reaches the conclusion that the State Bar was, if not the prime mover, certainly a co-equal partner in this entire matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1162.943" offset="4755101">The Court of Appeals below, majority, relied very heavily on the so-called learned profession exemption to the antitrust laws in finding immunity for the bar for these activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.899" offset="4811003">We believe that that reliance was misplaced and that the proper focus was on and should have been on this Court's decision in United States against American Medical Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.552" offset="4849560">In that case, this Court held that it was immaterial what the professions of the defendants were who were charged with that criminal conspiracy provided that a affect and purpose of that restraint was to restrain the trade of group health.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.250" offset="4908387">The defendants there were medical society and 21 doctors who opposed the establishment of prepaid medical services in matter not dissimilar to the prepaid legal services about which the Chief Justice just asked me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.019" offset="4967424">And the medical societies there issued rulings which said that it was unethical for a lawyer, excuse me for a doctor to work for group health and that it was unethical for other doctor to consult with that doctor or it's unethical for a hospital to and threat -- they threatened boycotts of hospitals that cooperated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.183" offset="5052061">And the result of this was of course a serious impairment of the proposal to deliver prepaid medical services to the workers in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.152" offset="5100022">In our view, the Court – Court's holding there that the profession was immaterial, requires a rejection of the attempt of the bar here to spread an ethical umbrella over its activities and to insulate it from the true effects which is as it was there to deprive consumers of opportunity for the free market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.303" offset="5188629">In AMA, this Court said that a conspiracy allegedly aimed at restraining or destroying competition or limiting the free availability of medical services violated the Sherman Act and it surely it does here also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.548" offset="5249546">I want to turn if I may to the alternative basis upon which the bar can escape, if “escape” is the proper word, from the strictures of the Sherman Act for those truly legitimate activities which the bar has and which do need to be carried forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.362" offset="5320808">Now, if the bar can establish under Parker, that there has been state action and that the state has intended to replace competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1499.923" offset="6103019">Exactly, Your Honor, or if Congress as Congress has so often done for other business problems, labor unions, the airlines, fair trade laws, there are whole raft of areas in which Congress has said, no competition is not to be all and end all for everybody, not on the state by state business, but for everybody and we want those situations to be covered by another rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.042" offset="6211584">With regard to Parker-Brown, I want to point out several important things by Parker that are different from this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.060" offset="6251604">In Parker first, there's a terribly important role played by the State Agriculture Commission who were all appointed by the Governor, confirmed by the Senate of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.164" offset="6292041">One of them included the State Agriculture Director and others included consumers and handlers as well as growers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.884" offset="6322866">Now, these individuals made the key and essential decisions in Parker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.657" offset="6341987">There was no more way in which the state could operate that program unless there was positive specific approval given by these individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.387" offset="6380962">Moreover, there had to be beyond that a good deal and of this I speak of the specific factual findings that the program for the particular industry was to be carried out in accordance with the statutory scheme, an insurance against any form of unreasonable profits and then, after full hearings and full determinations that competition ought to be replaced in that particular instance by some other form of control in order to preserve the agriculture wealth of the state that in that case, the Court held yes, there was an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.891" offset="6526934">This was indeed action of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.583" offset="6537697">We don't have anything about that kind here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.928" offset="6547101">The real activities here were conducted by the State Bar, and none of the committees who issued the fee schedules, fee reports, wrote the ethical opinions, none of them was appointed by the Governor, confirmed by the state Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.687" offset="6602167">There were no hearings, there were no factual findings, there was no kind of procedural assurance that any kind of policy mandate from the State of Virginia is being carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.663" offset="6641977">There was in short a very different kind of situation than what we had in Parker-Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.423" offset="6669040">The state Supreme Court has done only two, taken two actions which might conceivably be brought within the notion of an approval as in Parker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.746" offset="6710314">Number one, the Canons of Ethics number 12 which the State Bar adopted verbatim in this regard from the ABA's Canons of Ethics, indicated that in determining what a reasonable fee was it was proper to consider the customary fees in the area and that the customary fees in the areas included proper reference to minimum fee schedules, that's the one item.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.291" offset="6800488">Then, in 1969 and 1970 when the Canons of Ethics were replaced by the Code of Professional Responsibility, that language was taken out and the question of reasonable fees was again included and in ethical consideration 2-18, the American Bar Association, adopted by the Virginia State Bar, Virginia Supreme Court and said that minimum fee schedules are some guidance and what a reasonable fee is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.995" offset="6907382">Now, that is a very different kind of approval than was required in Parker-Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.926" offset="6931101">There was no consideration by the Virginia Supreme Court of either the ethical opinions, the fee reports of the fee schedules and most particularly there was no consideration of the numbers involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.544" offset="6977599">How much was reasonable fee, was there any assurance that the consumers were not being unfairly abused by the fee schedules as there was in Parker?</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.187" offset="7012080">None of that took place here and we suggest that that is a fatal flaw in the entire matter by which the minimum fee schedule system operated in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.073" offset="7067669">Finally, as in Parker, unlike Parker rather, there are no statutes here which give an indication to the State Bar or anyone else that these activities ought to be carried out as a replacement for competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.096" offset="7127751">A careful statutory scheme was taking place in Parker; a scheme fully consistent with the federal practice and indeed a scheme intended to preserve the agricultural wealth of the state without unreasonable profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.762" offset="7182399">And further, without profits in a situation that once the scheme went into effect, the program was approved after these long hearings and findings of fact that it no longer was optional that it became mandatory and any person who didn't follow that scheme for the growers of raisins in that case could subject to criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.522" offset="7269439">Your Honor, it is clear that if all of the developers in Western Virginia and all the bankers in the area and the neighboring areas, and all the real state brokers and sellers of title insurance had gotten together and published minimum fee schedules that anyone could be disciplined for not adhering to them, there can be little doubt that the Sherman Act would have been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.124" offset="7367868">The question before this Court is, are lawyers any different or do they have to meet the test that everyone else has to meet?</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.319" offset="7400678">We suggest that the Court of Appeals below was in error in reaching the contrary conclusion and accordingly we ask this Court to reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.102" offset="7431816">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1844.249" offset="7480404">I was hoping that Mr. Morrison would talk for two more minutes, but I should say that we, the United States supports the petitioners here and we believe that these minimum fee schedules are in fact illegal per se under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.247" offset="7532335">And I hope to spend my time primarily on the issues known somewhat inaccurately as the learned profession exemption and the state action exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.248" offset="7572355">It is clear I think that Section 1 of the Sherman Act applies to personal services and it is also clear that the circulation of minimum price schedules for personal services, even without an explicit agreement to adhere them would be a violation of the per se rule against price fixing, if the respondents here were stenographers or violinists or cosmetologists or somebody else and the question we have is why should not the per se rule be applied to lawyers?</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.270" offset="7692413">The answer said to be the ethical responsibilities of the bar and while one may concede that the bar has strong ethical responsibilities and indeed the power to police those violations of their standards, one search is in vain for the connection between professional ethics and price fixing for professional services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.605" offset="7773811">At least one search is in vain for a connection at least to the conclusion that price fixing is ethical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.323" offset="7804635">The charging of the fee is the one place where the lawyer and his client have an inescapable conflict of interest and it's rather mystifying why an agreement among lawyers to pit their collective strength against the individual client so that the lawyers may win out in that conflict of interest should be required as a matter of legal ethics.</text>

            <text syncTime="2071.848" offset="8390719">Yes, and the Employing Plasterers case and the Employing Lathers case in around Chicago I believe the court inferred that the flow of building materials into the area would be diminished as the prices were raised artificially and that gives you the necessary effect upon interstate commerce I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.853" offset="8466787">I think in fact, with these minimum fee schedules here, there would be little difficulty in concluding that the Sherman Act per se rule had been violated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2112.750" offset="8554350">The Chief Justice asked the question, “What about the bar's responsibility with respect to a lawyer who charges fees much too low and therefore necessarily, does shoddy work?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.788" offset="8594474">I think there are two answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.438" offset="8605132">One is that in Sherman Act terms, in other context, we never allow price fixing on the ground that the product will be made better if the price is higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.201" offset="8648182">We let the quality and the price both be set by the market.</text>

            <text syncTime="2185.058" offset="8843577">-- professional discipline is perhaps not been as effective as it should be, but I think now we're discussing and in this case, there's been discipline for cutting fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.512" offset="8885373">I think we're discussing now conceptually what it is that justifies a price fixing agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.582" offset="8909720">I don't think the fear of shoddy services or shoddy work and shoddy products under the antitrust laws does and I think the bar if it wishes to guard against statute, guard against the provision of shoddy services rather than the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.737" offset="8966353">The second question was asked by Mr. Justice Rehnquist who asked if this minimum fee schedule did not provide information to a young lawyer and other lawyers about what prices were current.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.040" offset="9027584">I'm sure it does, but fee or price schedules have been defended on that ground before and that argument has never succeeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.833" offset="9062693">You don't set the price to provide information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.398" offset="9077008">Trade association cases indicate that if you wish to provide information about the range of prices currently being charged in an area you may, but that is a far different thing from setting the price which the man must charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.594" offset="9129775">And thirdly, there was the question about whether or not, several questions about, whether or not there had been enforcement by the bar in disciplining people for charging low prices or whether there was a threat of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.310" offset="9180662">The usual antitrust rule is that the circulation of the price which is to be charged is sufficient for a violation of the Sherman Act and there need not be a mechanism or a threat of compulsion behind that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.495" offset="9245341">For example, the Nationwide Trailer System case which I think was part of which was summarily affirmed in this Court, holds that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.134" offset="9275956">I think the real problem in this case is really the “slippery slope” argument and that is the fear expressed by various bar associations that any application of a per se rule to any practice of the legal profession endangers all ethical regulation of the profession and I think that fear is groundless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.268" offset="9344397">I think there is room for legitimate regulation of professional behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.574" offset="9365713">Now, the per se rule, there are at least four defenses to an attempt to apply it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.256" offset="9388387">I don't think any of them applies here, but any of them may apply in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.957" offset="9411166">The first one of course is simply the defense that the restraint whatever it is ancillary to a legitimate join venture and that kind of an argument of course justifies restrains within a law firm, within an economic unit to make it more efficient, but as recognized ever since Addyston Pipe and Steel when Judge Taft explicated that branch of the antitrust law, but there is here and no economic integration between the entire bar, no joint venture to which the restraint could be ancillary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.682" offset="9534151">The second defense is state action within the meaning of Parker against Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.881" offset="9550869">That defense is not available here because the fee schedules here were not imposed by the Virginia legislature nor by any state agency charged by the legislature with the setting of fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.041" offset="9595486">Supreme Courts -- the Virginia Supreme Court's minimum relationship to fee schedules is not enough to satisfy Parker against Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.525" offset="9621504">The Court hasn't really proved or commanded these schedules and mere silence isn't enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="2429.858" offset="9822856">I think the -- in this case, I think Canon 12 says that of the fact is that it maybe considered are customary fees which may not be fee schedules or I think maybe the market range of fees, but that aside, perhaps I can answer your question best moving to the case where a state Supreme Court does put out a fee schedule and says abide by it as a matter of ethics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.372" offset="9920867">I have severed out that that would be a valid fee schedule and that the Sherman Act would not apply to people who followed it or following for a variety of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.431" offset="9961096">One is that that court although it may have the power to regulate ethics clearly cannot call anything ethics, it wishes to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.583" offset="9993697">It could not say, “You may not pay a secretary more than $6,000.00 a year.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2763.981" offset="11159280">We submit there are five issues here for this Court's determination today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.812" offset="11174640">And the very first one is the one Mr. Justice Rehnquist just turned to, is any Interstate commerce involved here in the first place, is there indeed any basis for jurisdiction, was there in the trial court and is that here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.119" offset="11231796">Secondly, is there any exemption or exclusion of the practice of law because of the so-called “learned professions” decisions over the years?</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.568" offset="11277667">Third, is the Virginia State Bar and the State of Virginia so intimately involved in the promulgation of advisory fee schedules that in fact the Parker against Brown doctrine is applicable to the fees promulgated even by voluntary local bar associations such as the Fairfax County Bar Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.916" offset="11359065">Fourth if advisory fee schedules be determined to be violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act in fact should per se treatment be accorded them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.760" offset="11406399">And finally, if the Fourth Circuit was wrong in its decision below should any adverse decision by this Court be applied prospectively only or should it be applied retroactively?</text>

            <text syncTime="3068.977" offset="12379303">So, it would have to depend on the transaction itself and the attorney is told in the introduction to the fee schedule that it is only one of the elements to be considered and that it is not to be controlling.</text>

            <text syncTime="3150.206" offset="12704162">The title examination is something which one after he decides upon the purchase then he's concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.007" offset="12731434">There is no evidence of any kind in the record that title examinations in Virginia are more or less expensive and in Maryland or the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.879" offset="12770931">There is a complete absence of any evidence that there is any effect on interstate commerce and counsel for the petitioners are very fairly conceded in their brief that clearly this transaction is not in interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="3277.715" offset="13214281">No sir, we do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.257" offset="13220446">We say the question is whether the transaction effects substantially interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.045" offset="13247509">Has this transaction substantially affected interstate commerce and there is no evidence that it has.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.778" offset="13282513">This is a title examination at cost of $522.00 on a house which was valued at over $50,000.00 and we say that does not show an effect of any substantial nature on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.930" offset="13355133">But turning now from that to the question of whether there is a learned profession's exemption or exclusion from the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.729" offset="13402258">It is incorrect, we submit, to say that we seek here today an exemption for the practice of law to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.769" offset="13438412">The practice of law has never been considered to be trade or commerce before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.099" offset="13463803">We are not seeking an exemption here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.844" offset="13474774">We are saying that the coverage of the antitrust laws as Congress intended, the term trade in commerce to mean and that 1890 simply does not extent to the learned professions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.684" offset="13538095">There are acts where Congress has carved out legislative immunity from the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.782" offset="13566516">The Capper-Volstead Act for example, Trade Associations, McCarran-Ferguson Act, Insurance where absent some congressional authority, commerce, insurance clearly commerce, agricultural organizations, clearly commerce were said to be exempt because of congressional declaration from the antitrust laws, but that is not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.222" offset="13656273">There is no case which has said that law is trade or commerce to the contrary everything the courts have said and we have called the Court's attention to each one of those instances as an average.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.889" offset="13706951">Over the past 80 years and perhaps even if we want to go back to the Schooner Nymph to 1833 has said that there is a distinction between trade and commerce and the professions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.444" offset="13757106">In fact, the phrases of the Sherman Act in 1890 had only the precedent of the Schooner Nymph before them at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.365" offset="13792841">In that case, Mr. Justice Story very clearly said that trade is one thing and the learned professions and the odds are another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.644" offset="13825964">So, if there was anything which the Congress had in its mind at that time in 1890 it would've been the decision in the Schooner Nymph.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.016" offset="13871417">In that connection, it is significant, we submit, that the Department of Justice in 1961 and again in 1965 when the question of advisory fee schedules were put to it by a sister bar organization of the Fairfax Bar Association said, “We regard this as not falling within the Sherman Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.297" offset="13964518">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.213" offset="13968175">Because the Sherman Act does not apply to the practice of law, it's not in commerce, it's not commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.014" offset="13995447">That was the Department of Justice's view 10 years ago, 15 years ago, a view which the Department of Justice changed only last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.936" offset="14031078">The Solicitor General has not commented upon that change in the Department of Justice's view, but I submit that that is persuasive evidence that the Department of Justice along with the Congress, along with this Court, along with other courts which had spoken to the issue had concluded that the antitrust laws in fact do not apply to the practice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.276" offset="14124492">But if we're wrong as to that, should in fact per se treatment be accorded to the practice of law and let me suggest another analogy and I think this takes off from what the Solicitor General said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.813" offset="14190634">Suppose there is a town in which there are two businesses -- a large one and a small one both of these businesses are in the process of trying to develop a breakthrough invention, a means of turning solar energy into nuclear energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.362" offset="14260851">They're both working on it as hard as they can.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.245" offset="14272345">In order to do that, they need a particular kind of refractor which is available only from one company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.490" offset="14297318">The large company goes to the manufacture or the manufacturer and says, “I want to purchase a refractor from you, but I want you to agree with me that you will not sell to it my competitor, who was also working on this process.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.099" offset="14351757">I suggest to you that that manufacturer has a serious antitrust problem on his hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.196" offset="14384149">But suppose there's only one patent lawyer in the city and the first manufacturer goes to the patent lawyer and says, “I want to apply for a patent and here is the background of the patent and I want you to agree with me that you will not represent my competitor in a patent action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.906" offset="14454993">Is there any antitrust violation there?</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.291" offset="14464502">Of course not, the attorney there is following the Canons of Ethics which forbid any conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.646" offset="14497938">Now the Solicitor General would suggest that some of the Canons of Ethics are good ones and some of them are bad ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.463" offset="14521240">I suspect the Solicitor General would say, “I think Canons of Ethics forbidding conflicts of interest are good and that we should have them and that we should prevent attorneys from having conflicts of interest.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.378" offset="14576933">The Solicitor General seems not quite as certain as counsel for the Goldfarb's as to whether advertising by attorneys is good or bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.638" offset="14609951">Both seem to believe that minimum fee schedules and the recommendation that they be considered along with many other factors are bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.808" offset="14642552">So, we see before us three different Canons of Ethics in the illustrations I have suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.379" offset="14660838">One involving a minimum fee schedule, one involving advertising, and one involving a conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.465" offset="14689259">And some of us would say that they are all proper, that the bar is capable and responsible for self regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.154" offset="14716008">Some would say some are good and some are bad, but is that any way for laws to be enforced?</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.509" offset="14741400">Is that anyway for an attorney to know how to determine, how he should perform his practice?</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.751" offset="14770343">We submit not, that there is no way that can be selective or choice enforcement of the antitrust laws if indeed certain aspects of the practice of law do involve Interstate commerce and we assert they do not, if indeed, certain aspects of the practice of law ought to be regulated by some other body then by professional responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.778" offset="14882461">And we submit that regulation should be made by the Congress and not by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.801" offset="14906598">By the Congress which has the opportunity to examine the entire background of the matter to determine what is appropriate under all the circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="3807.995" offset="15335320">Turning to a question as to which the Attorney General of Virginia will spend more time that I today on the question of whether the Parker against Brown doctrine insulates the advisory fee schedules of a Virginia State Bar or of local bar associations from the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.334" offset="15416717">I pause only to point out in that context that counsel for the Goldfarb's in his opening argument has generally agreed with our position and that is that when the state promulgated minimum fee schedules in 1962 and 1969 under the imprimatur of the Virginia State Bar which is an administrative agency of the Virginia Supreme Court and then issued the opinions which it did, it thereby did indeed sanction and direct state action and as I understand the argument for petitioners here today that state action was bad as to the Virginia State Bar and so it's bad as the local bar association.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.273" offset="15612426">But if this Court concludes as the court below did that that action is proper as to the Virginia State Bar then we say it must follow that that action was proper as to the Fairfax Bar Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.773" offset="15662477">And in addition to the promulgation of the two collections of the minimum fee schedules, the Virginia State Bar has indeed issued various ethical opinions considering minimum fee schedules and let me simply call to the Court's attention, Opinion 98 which is reproduced in the joint appendix at page A-46. I simply wish to read one sentence from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.040" offset="15771564">“To ignore such schedules under these circumstances has no ethical justification and deserves censure.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.653" offset="15810017">These opinions are available to and are furnished to every member of the Virginia State Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.676" offset="15834049">What is he to do when he reads that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.349" offset="15844812">Is he not to consider that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.393" offset="15852962">Of course it's not binding, of course it's not the only thing he will consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.739" offset="15870307">There were six considerations under the Canons of Ethics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.691" offset="15886085">There are eight considerations under the Code of Professional Responsibility, but it's one of the things he must consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="3954.053" offset="15919626">I would be surprised if there is a lawyer within the sound of my voice today who has not at one time or another considered the propriety of the ability of a client to pay a fee in establishing the proper fee to charge that client.</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.162" offset="16008025">If a businessman were to pick and choose among his customers as to what he would charge them, he would pretty clearly be in violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3986.910" offset="16050970">Would anyone suggest that an attorney who follows the Canons of Ethics which say that he should consider the ability of the client to pay, it's set forth right in this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.918" offset="16099035">Would anyone suggest that he is there by violating the antitrust laws?</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.518" offset="16113455">Of course not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.783" offset="16118471">That's the nature of the profession, it's a service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.694" offset="16126098">It's a service to a society and not a mere money-making occupation as a Canons of Ethics have so frequently pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.517" offset="16189419">Even if none of the protections which I suggest exist that is that there is no substantial effect on interstate commerce that the practice of law is not included within the ambit of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, now, the Parker against Brown doctrine does indeed insulate the Fairfax Association schedule from the antitrust laws, even if we and the court below were wrong on all of those, we submit this is not a per se case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.308" offset="16316583">It is not a case in which this Court or any court without consideration of all the factors, without consideration of all the professional responsibilities can act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4067.786" offset="16374471">But even if we're wrong about all of that, we suggest that this fee, this decision should not be applied retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.065" offset="16403623">That attorneys who has the court below said having good faith followed the Canons of Ethics should be punished in a punitive way for that's what treble damage recovery is, it's punitive in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4087.519" offset="16453465">This Court has said it dozens of times and indeed it is, why they should be punished in a financial way because of their adherence to the minimum fee schedules, because of their consideration of these advisory schedules along with all the other test.</text>
            <text syncTime="4104.929" offset="16523055">This Court in the Chevron decision set forth the circumstances under which it would excuse retroactive application of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.763" offset="16562448">Without going in to that case in detail, we suggest that if this Court gets to that point and we say there is no reason for it to get to those point, it should apply the Chevron test and decide that any decision should be applied in the future only.</text>
            <text syncTime="4131.923" offset="16631097">When we get back to the same fine as we began, there is no substantial effect on Interstate commerce here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4140.622" offset="16665893">There is no basis for this Court to say, “Some Canons of Ethics are good and some Canons of Ethics are bad and we'll reward the attorney who follows the good ones and we'll punish the attorney who follows the bad ones.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.948" offset="16723153">Those are not matters as to which this Court should speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="4159.573" offset="16741648">Those are matters as to which Congress is speaking, must be done, should speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="4163.971" offset="16759306">So, we say in conclusion that the professional system of self-regulation of the practice of law; the discipline and ethics of the attorney which we suggest have furnished this country exceptionally good legal services over the years, services which are often provided free or in minimal cost to those who are unable to pay for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.180" offset="16872051">If this system is to be changed upon a plea of consumer interests and the distinctions between trades and professions obliterated, we suggest that that obliteration should not be done by the courts, but by the Congress and if it must be done, it may be the consumers who suffer the most.</text>

            <text syncTime="4523.707" offset="18198235">My name is Andrew Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="4525.161" offset="18203982">I'm Attorney General of Virginia and counsel for the Virginia State Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="4530.085" offset="18223731">My portion to the argument will be devoted to a discussion of the nature of the organization known as the State Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="4537.428" offset="18253093">It's rule in the activities which form the basis for this proceeding and the reasons why this rule constitutes state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4547.463" offset="18293217">Now, the State Bar is an administrative agency of the Supreme Court of Virginia created by that court pursuant to the laws of the Commonwealth in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="4561.299" offset="18348596">The Virginia Supreme Court has promulgated rules governing the conduct of attorneys and the operation of the State Bar which are found in part 6 of the Court's rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="4572.517" offset="18393422">The powers of the State Bar were signed by the Supreme Court to its counsel to which in addition to certain elected members, six persons are appointed by the court itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4588.433" offset="18457057">Now, there are number of voluntary Bar Associations in the Commonwealth, both at the local and at the state level.</text>
            <text syncTime="4595.495" offset="18485373">Now, the state level, there is the Virginia Bar Association, the Old Dominion Bar Association, the Virginia Trial Lawyers Association, etcetera, but each attorney pricing law in Virginia is required by statute and by rule to be a member of the State Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="4612.280" offset="18552456">The State Bar is mandated both by the general assembly and the Supreme Court of Virginia to investigate alleged violations of prescribed standards of conduct and to report its findings to a court of appropriate jurisdiction for any disciplinary procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="4631.578" offset="18629674">These investigations are carried out by the district committees of the State Bar organized in each of the 10 congressional districts in the Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4641.073" offset="18667708">Pursuant to the code, the funds for operation of the State Bar are appropriated from a special fund in the state treasury by act of the general assembly of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="4652.483" offset="18713266">The special fund in the state treasury consists of fees paid by members of the State Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="4658.022" offset="18735417">The amounts of which are set pursuant to statute by the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4663.722" offset="18758301">Now, the general assembly has established a ceiling on the setting of such fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4669.708" offset="18782229">The State Bar has given -- been given authority by the Supreme Court of Virginia to issue advisory opinions on matters involving questions of ethics.</text>
            <text syncTime="4682.215" offset="18832280">Analysis of existing fee schedules of local bar association by the State Bar involved questions of ethics in that they may provide some guidance on the subject of fairness of fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4696.430" offset="18889122">Now it has been stipulated that the State Bar has been authorized, Mr. Justice White, by the Supreme Court to issue opinions such as Legal Ethics Opinions 98 and 170 which relate to the significance of minimum fee schedules adopted by local bar associations and to disseminate studies on such schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="4719.703" offset="18982222">Now, I refer you to stipulation 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="4724.755" offset="19002389">In Parker v. Brown, this Court stated that the Sherman Act was not intended by Congress to restrain actions by the state, its officers or agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.780" offset="19042513">Now, while the fact that there is state action, does not automatically confer antitrust immunity upon a person or corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4744.870" offset="19082846">I submit that the Sherman Act's sanctions are inapplicable to a state agency involved in such activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4752.836" offset="19114715">And this is true I submit whether the state action is mandated by command of the legislature as in Parker or by the judiciary, Mr. Justice Brennan, you raised the question of inherent power earlier in this argument or by both as in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4772.527" offset="19193501">And the conduct of the State Bar alleged to have contributed to a restrain of trade relates to its role in enforcement of the Code of Professional Responsibility promulgated by the Supreme Court of Virginia in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="4788.589" offset="19257762">Now, pursuant to, and the Supreme Court made this very clear, both the statute and its inherent authority, the Supreme Court of Virginia organized the State Bar to act as its administrative agency for the purpose of investigating and reporting violations of such ethical standards as the Court has promulgated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4808.410" offset="19336965">Further, pursuant to both statute and inherent authority, the court has implemented specific disciplinary procedures should violations to be deemed to have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="4820.482" offset="19385344">In 1970, the Supreme Court amended its rules by substituting a new Code of Professional Responsibility for the Canons of Professional Ethics which had been promulgated in 1938 at the time that the State Bar was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="4835.228" offset="19444276">Now, pursuant to this Code, an attorney is prohibited from charging an excessive fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4841.723" offset="19470294">In determining his fee, it is provided that an attorney should consider among seven other factors, the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services.</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.028" offset="19515434">It is further stated that suggested fee schedules provide guidance as to what might be considered reasonable fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.891" offset="19546885">And clearly, the State Bar has the duty provide attorneys and local bar associations with self-governed guidelines by which the reasonableness of fees can be judged and the minimum fee schedule reports circulated in 1962 and 1969 served this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.916" offset="19619088">I want to emphasize to the Court in response to some previous questions from the bench that the State Bar did not undertake to establish a minimum fee schedule for the state as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="4893.260" offset="19676453">All that these reports of 1962 and 1969 addressed themselves to were an analysis of the fee schedules which had in fact been adopted by local bar associations.</text>

            <text syncTime="5607.341" offset="22532786">We believe that the Solicitor General is entirely correct in his position that the focus should beyond the activity of the defendants whereas we have here a broad base conspiracy involving all of the attorneys in Northern Virginia who have agreed to a per se violation constituting price fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5625.893" offset="22606973">And we look to the decision of this Court in Burke against Ford for that kind of analysis where we plainly have a restraint against title examinations which are not only an integral part of home financing in Northern Virginia, but absolute necessity because under the opinions of the Virginia Bar, only lawyers can give opinions on title examination.</text>

            <text syncTime="5696.252" offset="22888364">That where we have a massive involvement as we have here with Interstate commerce that once we have established this jurisdictional nexus and shown that the transaction, the restraint here operates on an integral part of what is a larger interstate transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5713.197" offset="22956178">And we have a per se violation that under Burke we not inquire further.</text>
            <text syncTime="5718.183" offset="22976136">As the Court said there, such per se restraints inevitably affect intestate commerce and that the kind of proof as Mr. Booker suggests is required certainly impossible to do with lots of little small transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5731.630" offset="23029844">So we look at the entire context and in that way, we believe that we satisfy the commerce requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="5738.953" offset="23059205">My time has been limited here so I would refer the Court only to my brief with the issue with regard to the issue of prospectively and as far as the question of mootness is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5748.813" offset="23098598">The case is certainly not moot as to the Virginia State Bar which has to this date insisted upon its right to issue the ethical opinions, to continue them in force, it is not withdrawn them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5760.174" offset="23144051">It may tomorrow issue another updated fee report with recommendations to the local bars or indeed promulgate its own fee report as to which this Court should and ought in this posture to adjudicate the lawfulness of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5779.138" offset="23219911">And finally, I would just say that with regard to the position previously taken by the Justice Department of those letters appear in the appendix at pages 49 to 58 and indicate in that context that the Justice Department was primarily concerned about the commerce question, indicating that the practice of law did not affect commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5798.043" offset="23295561">And for that reason, minimum fee schedules were not subject to the Sherman Act not because lawyers were exempt from the antitrust laws.</text>
