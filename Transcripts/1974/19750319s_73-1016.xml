            <text syncTime="16.570" offset="66247">In this case, a three-judge District Court in New York held invalid a New York statute that required the recipient of welfare benefits to cooperate in a paternity or support action against an absent parent as a condition of eligibility for benefits under the program for Aid to Families with Dependent Children.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.665" offset="186619">The ground of the decision was that the New York statute was in conflict with the eligibility requirements of the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.681" offset="234684">Since that case was decided below, Congress has amended the federal statute effective the coming July which now makes ineligible for benefits any recipient who refuses to cooperate to compel the absent parent to contribute to the support of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.034" offset="348056">Therefore, although we agree with the three-judge court that the New York statute was invalid for the reason given by the three-judge court and therefore affirm its judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.481" offset="405838">In light of the new statute we have no occasion to prepare an extended opinion.</text>
