            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="10.573" offset="42214">This case is here by way of writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.155" offset="76591">A New York statute permits a defendant in a criminal case to plead guilty without forfeiting his right to appellate judicial review of certain constitutional claims including the claim that evidence supporting the criminal charge was obtained by the state in a search procedure that violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.469" offset="165825">The respondent, Leon Newsome, pleaded guilty in a New York court to a drug offense and then appealed under that statute to the New York appellate courts which ultimately rejected his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment claim and affirmed his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.977" offset="243879">Newsome then applied to a Federal District Court for a writ of habeas corpus and that Court granted him relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.030" offset="276062">The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's judgment granting the writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.222" offset="300826">At the behest of the petitioner, Louis Lefkowitz who is the Attorney General of the State of New York, we granted certiorari to consider his claim that federal habeas corpus relief is not available under the circumstances of this case because of the plea of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.566" offset="378253">For the reasons set out on the written opinion of the Court filed today with the clerk, we hold that when a state law permits a defendant to plead guilty without forfeiting his right to judicial review of specified constitutional issues, the defendant is not foreclosed from pursuing those constitutional claims in a federal habeas corpus proceeding after he has exhausted his state remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.126" offset="488490">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.793" offset="511164">Mr. Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion which the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Rehnquist have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.528" offset="542093">Mr. Justice Powell has also filed a dissenting opinion which the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Rehnquist have also joined.</text>
