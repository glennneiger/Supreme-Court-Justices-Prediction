            <text syncTime="38.862" offset="258800">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.046" offset="271548">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of the Tenth Circuit to review a decision of that case that held unconstitutional 18 U.S.C. 1154, one of the principal laws regulating the introduction of liquor into Indian reservations and 18 U.S.C. 1161, law of the same purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.995" offset="375306">In doing so, it reversed the District Court which had convicted the defendants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.518" offset="417416">I think the best way to approach this case is first with an analysis of these statutes for a few minutes and then with the exact facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.716" offset="466213">The facts will make sense in the context of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.115" offset="483871">The problem of liquor on Indian reservations has been a serious problem to Indian tribes and to Congress for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.945" offset="527130">And in the 1800’s, Congress absolutely prohibited the introduction of liquor into Indian country and absolutely prohibited the sale of liquor to Indians who are under the guardianship of the United States no matter where they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.024" offset="595466">This remained essentially the law until 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.516" offset="613439">In 1949, the Act which is now Section (c) of 18 U.S.C. 1154, that’s on page 3 of our brief, was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.821" offset="662653">That Section redefined Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.268" offset="676446">You know, Indian country has been defined include all the land inside an Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.083" offset="699747">That Act redefined Indian country for the purposes of the liquor laws to exclude rights of ways through reservations and non-Indian communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.891" offset="750947">The Congress in making that amendment which was just part of a general set of amendments to 18 U.S.C. said that it was to bring the statute more into accord with the way the statute has actually been enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.923" offset="811029">Then, the practical effect of it of course, was to say that where there were little non-Indian communities on an Indian reservation that liquor could be sold there or that a truck passing through an Indian reservation couldn’t be stopped because it was carrying liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.615" offset="893785">Then in 19 --</text>

            <text syncTime="198.711" offset="898173">Subsection (c) says an absence of a three-year statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry R. Sachse</label>
            <text syncTime="206.804" offset="930565">There’s nothing in the treaty in no particular statute that would apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.742" offset="950314">There could be a treaty that would say nowhere in the reservation ever or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.975" offset="975287">Then in 1953, 18 U.S.C. 1161 was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.249" offset="996394">This was a local option statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.266" offset="1008410">Indian people had felt sometime that the law is totally prohibiting introduction of liquor into Indian reservations was discriminatory against them and unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.610" offset="1053863">And Congress reacting to that passed a very limited statute that said, liquor was still illegal in Indian country as defined by these two statutes but it could be legally introduced if: number one, it did not violate state law and number two, the tribe passed an ordinance allowing it to be introduced and that ordinance was approved by the Secretary of the Interior and published in the Federal Register.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.346" offset="1176743">That was a degree of control over the introduction into Indian country that 18 U.S.C. 1161 provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.288" offset="1212479">Now, facts of this case, the Wind River Reservation is a major reservation in Wyoming, the Shoshone and Arapahoe tribes are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.348" offset="1276740">In 1953, after the passage of this, of 18 U.S.C. 1161, they took advantage of the new Act and passed an ordinance saying that liquor could be introduced into the reservation if it was done so in accordance with state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.844" offset="1342777">After that ordinance was approved by the Secretary of the Interior, advertised in the Federal Register.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.143" offset="1359914">After they passed that ordinance, the predecessors of the Mazurie has bought a piece of property on the reservation and opened a bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.565" offset="1401605">They then operated that bar where they had a valid state liquor license.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.718" offset="1418219">They operated the bar for 18 years then the tribe reconsidered its original resolution, decided that it shouldn’t have the reservation be wide open.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.978" offset="1475271">It passed a new ordinance, an ordinance -- ordinance number 26 which provided that to introduce liquor into the reservation, that person henceforth would have to obtain a tribal license as well as the state license.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.183" offset="1540054">This regulation which set out in some details, the information that had to be supplied to the tribe, the standards for obtaining a tribal license, was approved by the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.504" offset="1597419">It’s a regulation that’s pretty much like any municipality’s regulation on liquor license.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.407" offset="1628975">This was approved by the Secretary of the Interior, advertised in the Federal Register.</text>

            <text syncTime="414.511" offset="1761468">It was validly adopted regulation and the publication of Federal Register was also introduced at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.633" offset="1809951">The regulation allowed an existing bar to continue until it had to get a new state license and at that time required it to apply for the tribal license as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.798" offset="1858539">The Mazuries did not apply for the tribal license.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.502" offset="1869406">They were notified then to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.020" offset="1879437">They then did apply for the tribal license, gave the information that was required and a public hearing was set up by the tribal counsel to hear their application.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.216" offset="1928234">At that hearing, there was considerable testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.116" offset="1947878">This is in the record also, of disorderliness at that bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.968" offset="1967208">There was a testimony that the bar was near a housing project where a lot of old people lived and that people came out of the bar at late night making all sorts of noise.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.111" offset="2007855">There was a testimony that there have been summary killings on the reservation, all of which have been associated with the use of alcohol that there had been fights in this particular bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.125" offset="2051845">That the bar had been selling to minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.110" offset="2063862">As a result to this, the tribe refused the liquor license to the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.611" offset="2089775">Mazuries then closed the bar for a period of several weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.861" offset="2106807">They then decided to reopen it in defiance of the action of the tribe.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="508.739" offset="2138363">Mr. Sachse, did all of these untoward incidents happen during the 18-year period or just toward the end of it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry R. Sachse</label>
            <text syncTime="518.241" offset="2176293">I don’t think the record shows precisely when a particular incident happened, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.691" offset="2210147">I’m unable to determine from the transcript that was there whether these things occurred for the last few days or earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.326" offset="2260720">The B.I.A then closed the bar and the U.S. Attorney brought a misdemeanor charge against the Mazuries under 18 U.S.C. 1154 for operating a bar in an Indian country as defined in that statute without the consent of the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.780" offset="2338461">At the trial, almost everything I’ve said up to now was stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.048" offset="2359568">Stipulation is in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.458" offset="2377226">The trial focused on the question of whether the Mazuries could claim that their bar was in a non-Indian community and thus was accepted from the tribal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.486" offset="2433337">The Government introduced the witnesses on this point and the testimony was quite complete on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.317" offset="2480671">The Government showed that the bar was located three quarters of a mile from Fort Washakie which is an unincorporated village which is the headquarters of the tribal governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.439" offset="2529155">They showed that there had been a housing survey made a year or so previously to determine the condition of housing in that area and that it showed, and the man who made the survey was there, testified and was cross-examined, that within a 20-square mile area of Fort Washakie, there were only 212 families living and that of those a 170 and a half were Indian families and that 41 and a half were non-Indian families and the halves were one mixed family that lived in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.209" offset="2672201">They counted that family as a half each way.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.889" offset="2686934">The Government also brought in the superintendent of the school district there and there was a state school supported both by federal funds and state funds open to all the children who lived in that area and the superintendent testified that of 243 students that 223 were Indian and the school was two and one-half miles from the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.275" offset="2792469">Mr. Mazurie himself testified that “we are kind of out there by ourselves, you know.”</text>
            <text syncTime="682.854" offset="2834787">He also testified that this bar served both Indians and non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.289" offset="2856521">That when there was trouble, if it was trouble with Indians he’d call the tribal police; and if there was trouble with non-Indians he’d call the county sheriff.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.243" offset="2896332">On the basis of this record, the -- I should say the case was tried before a judge alone, it was jury waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.383" offset="2920887">On the basis of this record, the district judge found that the defendants had opened the bar in Indian country in violation of the statute and implicit in that finding, of course, was that it did not fit in the exception of the statute if a bar run in a non-Indian community because that was the real point of the testimony at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.640" offset="3033945">Now, the Court of Appeals found that the term non-Indian community is undefined and therefore no one could tell whether he was operating a non-Indian community.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.730" offset="3086294">Therefore, the entire statute, 18 U.S.C. 1154 which prohibits the introduction of liquor into an Indian country is unconstitutionally vague because it contains this exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.200" offset="3140211">The Court went on to say even if the statute is not unconstitutionally vague; we doubt that Congress has the authority to prohibit sales of liquor by a non-Indian on land that he owns in an Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.793" offset="3202591">And then went on to say, but even if Congress does have that authority, it’s an unconstitutional delegation of that authority to let the tribe itself make the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.288" offset="3252537">Even under the limited circumstances of this statute as to whether liquor can be sold within the Indian country in its reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.906" offset="3306977">We think, as you know, that this decision of the Court of Appeals is just simply dead wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.203" offset="3340204">That first, on the question of the vagueness of the statute, certainly, one can postulate a situation in which it might be difficult to tell whether one is in an Indian community or non-Indian community.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.635" offset="3409899">Actually, in 25, 26 years of application of the statute apparently that kind of problem hasn’t come up but this is not a First Amendment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.312" offset="3452635">This is an ordinary criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.394" offset="3464965">And the test in the case such as this is not whether one can find vague areas but whether the statute was vague as applied to these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.927" offset="3503104">Congress meant something sensible by the words “non-Indian community” and there’s no sensible definition of non-Indian community that could include a bar three quarters of a mile from the tribal headquarters in an area with one of the highest concentrations of Indian families that you often find in an Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.155" offset="3604041">I think the Court’s -- I think I don’t need to recite to the Court its test in the United State versus National Dairy Corporation that that test is applicable and I think Justice Holmes’ statement in the Wurzbach case quoted recently by the Court in Broderick versus Oklahoma is also quite applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.348" offset="3704769">That if there’s any difficulty in borderline cases, I interpose, there would be time enough to consider it when raised by someone whom it concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.328" offset="3744684">It’s quite clear that the Mazuries knew they needed this tribal license, they only opened the bar after the tribe that passed its ordinance and that as far as they’re concerned, they simply don’t have standing to raise what might be some borderline question in some other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.302" offset="3832560">Now, on the question of the authority of Congress, that’s absolutely clear that Congress had totally prohibited sales of liquor in the Indian reservations before it modified those regulations that prohibition covered both Indian-owned and non-Indian owned land.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.780" offset="3918451">The constitutional authority for this is Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution which gives the Congress authority over trade with the Indians and this Court flatly held years ago in United States versus Perrin that Congress has the authority to regulate the sale of liquor within Indian country whether it’s on privately held or publicly held land and Perrin is not the only case.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.368" offset="4036838">Practically, every aspect of that law was litigated at one time or another and the half-dozen cases on page 15, 16 of our brief that support this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.302" offset="4096606">Now, --</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry R. Sachse</label>
            <text syncTime="1006.330" offset="4128684">Well, I don’t sympathize with them too much because they opened the business on an Indian reservation because the tribe had made one of two choices, either to allow or not to allow, or to -- the introduction of liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.925" offset="4191065">Now, they knew that that was an inexorable choice that if things didn’t work out, the tribe could change this and when the tribe did change it, that they’d have to apply for tribal license or could be totally prohibited if the tribe just said “no liquor on the reservation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.763" offset="4262431">So they went in to make profit from the opening of this reservation to sales of liquor and there’s no vested interest there that I can see.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.394" offset="4332962">And I should point out that subsequently, the state also denied their liquor license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.246" offset="4360338">This didn’t render the case moot because they had already been convicted of the federal offense but the state also whatever reasons felt that this bar shouldn’t continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.237" offset="4444348">As to the delegation of authority proposition, I just want to make several short statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.236" offset="4476322">One is that an Indian tribe is a governmental unit that this Court has recognized that when the tribe -- that reservations were reserved, is the area where the tribe’s governmental authority would apply, for instance in the McClanahan case that a tribe that a state ordinarily doesn’t have jurisdiction inside an Indian reservation, that narrow exceptions have been drawn in matters purely affecting non-Indians the state will have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.782" offset="4626474">But where an important Indian interest is at issue and the sale of liquor within an Indian reservation, I think it’s clearly such an interest that the tribe does have a certain governmental authority and there’s quite a good argument that could be made that even without any statute of Congress, the tribe would have the right to prohibit the sale of liquor within the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.354" offset="4720828">And I refer the Court to rather old cases of this Court leading one of which is Morris versus Hitchcock which is stated in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.333" offset="4760743">But here, we don’t have to get into the more difficult question of a tribe’s general authority over non-Indians who live on the reservation because Congress which the Court over and over has recognized is having plenary authority in this area has specifically granted this legislative power and has done it in a very limited and restricted way with full account for the interest of non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.444" offset="4889161">The very exception that’s attacked for non-Indian communities recognizes and protects a non-Indian interest here and the requirement that the regulation be approved by the Secretary of the Interior is -- makes this a very limited delegation of authority and that it be advertised in public -- Federal Register, so that everyone will know that it’s there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.182" offset="4992084">And I point out that this Court has stated numerous times that in assuming responsibility for the Indians, I’m thinking here particularly of the Mancari case which the Court decided last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.200" offset="5060211">But it relies on a whole line of cases before that Congress necessarily has the power to do the things that are reasonably necessary to perform that trust responsibility and nothing could be a better exercise of the trust responsibility than to return in this controlled and limited way, some power to the tribes to decide whether there’s very important problem to the tribes is to be handled by a complete prohibition or by other methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.669" offset="5198033">I have one other thing I want to say before I sit down but I think my time is up for --</text>

            <text syncTime="1282.506" offset="5233351">Well, I would say this that I think behind the Tenth Court’s opinion as a proposition that an Indian tribe shouldn’t ever make a decision that affects a non-Indian and that the idea that a non-Indian has to submit himself to the tribe’s jurisdiction on whether to open a bar there is simply some way on non-Indian American, on White American or something like that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1356.778" offset="5530520">I live in Riverton, Wyoming and we are centered approximately in the center of the Wind River Indian Reservation which is a reservation made up of the Shoshone and Arapahoe tribes and which has, I’m sure you are aware constitutes considerably over two million acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.023" offset="5615470">The history of this reservation has been varied and sundry with a considerable amount of land being removed from the reservation by the federal government all of that north of the Wind River and they then started distinguishing the cases based on what was south of the Wind River which is the area which we have which they call the portion of that which had not been taken away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.512" offset="5733439">Now, the basis for the patent in this case which was rendered to my class predecessor in title was 34 Stat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.740" offset="5790281">182 which states among other things that the United States Government upon the issuance of that patent without restriction thus thereby relinquished all jurisdiction over that particular portion of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.407" offset="5873037">So then, who has jurisdiction over that land and that is taken up immediately by Article XXI, Section 26 of the Wyoming Constitution which says that the minute a patent is issued that the -- excuse me -- that the land becomes subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.726" offset="5978258">Now, Mr. Mazurie and the Blue Bull Inc. are both legal citizens of the State of Wyoming.</text>

            <text syncTime="3207.555" offset="12933622">The State of Wyoming’s interest in this particular case on our -- our inference’s amicus is first off that this is fee-patented land owned by a non-Indian and it’s our position that the State of Wyoming has so and exclusive jurisdiction over this liquor license.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.422" offset="13029021">Secondly that the State of Wyoming provides due process protections in the issuance of a liquor license, due process protection and the renewal of a liquor license, due process protection on the revocation or suspension of a liquor license.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.845" offset="13122748">Basically, our laws pertaining to the regulation of liquor in the State of Wyoming protect not only the licensee which in this case is the respondent but also the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.789" offset="13194533">And we would respectfully submit to the Court that Indians are certainly part of the public of the State of Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.415" offset="13229014">They’re citizens of Wyoming and of the United States that we provide by statutory machinery a mechanism wherein the members of the reservation, both Arapahoe and Shoshone, can participate in the statutory procedures relating to the renewal or suspension of revocation of a liquor license.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.152" offset="13331937">We feel that on the disestablishment or relinquishment theory, we feel that the opinions of this Court in 1914 in Clairmont v. United States and also Dick v. United States, about the same time, are very important here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.455" offset="13413230">We think that these two cases support the proposition that fee-patented lands owned by a non-Indian is not subject to federal control or Indian control.</text>

            <text syncTime="3834.713" offset="15442213">And then the testimony as to the school children, it was testified that they were enrolled members of the tribe and the testimony as to the Indian population, it was discussed, who was enrolled, who wasn’t enrolled and the figures stand up one way or the other.</text>
