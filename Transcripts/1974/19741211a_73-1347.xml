            <text syncTime="193.059" offset="875604">We have submitted several sets of rules to the court, to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.843" offset="902771">First of all, we amended our original rules of prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.227" offset="920325">These rules are no longer in existence, but the first amendment of our rule added procedural and substantive safeguards to these rules but the District Court said he could not give any approval to any form of prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.219" offset="980198">So at that time he ordered to us again amend our rules which we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.588" offset="997752">Our second amendment of our rules contained only subsequent restraints and we had quite a few of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.515" offset="1025442">The District Court also declared those facially unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.038" offset="1043519">He entered a permanent injunction against us as well as declaring these rules facially unconstitutional and this injunction was upheld in its entirety by the Seventh Circuit, so we have a permanent injunction against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.099" offset="1099734">We also have a complete inability to have any rules or regulations of what is going to be distributed in our school, so this issue is very much alive even though the Corn Cob Curtain as a particular newspaper is no longer an existence.</text>

            <label>Ms. Lila J. Young</label>
            <text syncTime="278.144" offset="1215927">There are basically five issues presented to this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.320" offset="1232645">One is the validity of our rules of prior restraint, the rules adding the substantive and procedural safeguards that were suggested by the other circuits which had approved the principle of prior review of student literature prior to its distribution in school.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.099" offset="1299728">Two of the issues concern the validity of our rules of subsequent restraint and whether the Court of Appeals erroneously applied principles in declaring these rules facially void.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.035" offset="1359496">Our fourth issue is whether the District Court erred in his complete refusal to apply the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures 17 (c) simply because the infant plaintiffs in this case had raised a constitutional issue so he totally ignored the mandate of that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.887" offset="1438908">The fifth issue which I plan to emphasize here today is whether elementary and high schools can either prevent or discipline students who use gutter language in our elementary and high schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.849" offset="1498781">Since we all know what these words are and they're printed in the appendix, I would prefer not to repeat them here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.594" offset="1521768">They involve more than words, they involved phrases and filthy cartoons.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.298" offset="1544547">Now, it's your decision whether or not children will be using gutter language in our elementary and high schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.662" offset="1582059">If you decide that school officials can neither prevent nor discipline students who use this language in school, then many basic functions of our schools will be destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.483" offset="1633259">One of these basic functions is to teach children how to use language properly and in socially acceptable terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.083" offset="1671711">Now, this cannot be taught in our schools and it will not be taught.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.801" offset="1690624">If you decide that the school officials can do nothing about it and if the students in our school say, “We'll, it's okay for us to write and distribute this language because the Supreme Court says its fine.”</text>
            <text syncTime="411.448" offset="1749138">Now, a lot of time could be spent discussing what label we might attach to these words whether they should be classified as legally obscene as to minors or as indecent.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.356" offset="1796786">But the classification or label attached to this filth doesn't change the fact that it belongs in the gutter and not in our school houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.638" offset="1833880">Now, it's either right or wrong for children to be using and distributing this language in our schools and if it's wrong then our school officials should be able to do something about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.412" offset="1884975">It seems incredible that the right to control the use of this language in our schools should even be questioned, let alone denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.087" offset="1927711">Our briefs discussed many harmful consequences of allowing this type of language to be spread throughout our elementary and high schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="3227.921" offset="13015019">Also, we have compulsory education under statutes until age 16 in Indiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="3396.059" offset="13687620">It would be hypocritical and inconsistent to try to preach one thing in the classroom while the children are out in the halls distributing this type of language and the children would recognize this inconsistency too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.480" offset="13745298">I think there are three crucial factors involving all of these issues that you have to keep in mind when you make this decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.214" offset="13776227">First of all, we are dealing with children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.275" offset="13784482">We're not dealing with adults and for a good reason, the law, all facets of the law have always been applied differently to children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.560" offset="13825651">I think this Court has recognized this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.252" offset="13836413">Also the second crucial factor is that we are not concerned with any regulation of conduct in the community at large, but only in the school house, in the elementary and high schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.947" offset="13887195">These factors, you cannot equate the community at large to our elementary and high schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.184" offset="13912064">The physically confining nature, the purposes and the needs of the school, the fact that children are required to attend all of these circumstances dictate far different regulations, regulations which might not be acceptable in the community at large but they are very necessary in order to provide an atmosphere so that learning can take place in our schools and that's the purpose of our schools, to teach and they can't teach unless they have rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.078" offset="14027734">Also, the third basic factor that underlies all of these rules and issues is that we are not here concerned with criminal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.115" offset="14067858">There are no criminal penalties here attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.863" offset="14078830">Students cannot be fined, they cannot be imprisoned, they cannot be subjected to probationary supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.550" offset="14105579">They cannot be disenfranchised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.784" offset="14114461">They can be subjected only to mild disciplinary majors and I submit this is a fundamental difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.076" offset="14139643">We are not here defining crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.602" offset="14149778">We're defining what proper conduct in the school house, not beyond the school house gates, we have no regulations concerning that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.633" offset="14189902">So I question the relevancy of many of these cases that concern the community at large and also concern criminal matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.258" offset="14228355">We shouldn't have to spend the time going down elements and having hearings and everything because we have an inherent responsibility to provide an atmosphere where you have all these children grouped together, not by choice and I think the parents have something to say about this too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.742" offset="14302333">They expect generally accepted standards to be adhered to by their children in the schools and I think the state has a basic fundamental interest in requiring them to adhere to these acceptable standards of conduct because if they aren't going to be taught in schools, where are they going to be taught at?</text>
