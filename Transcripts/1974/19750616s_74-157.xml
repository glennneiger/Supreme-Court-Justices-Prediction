            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="16.793" offset="67082">This case here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit involves a large New York cooperative housing project known as Co-op City.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.250" offset="112953">This nonprofit project was financed and constructed under a New York law designed to provide low cost cooperative housing for low income tenants.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.693" offset="158720">The project was heavily subsidized by long term low interest mortgage loans and tax exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.663" offset="194560">Co-op City solicited perspective tenants by an information bulletin which described the project and included estimates of construction cost and monthly rental charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.346" offset="249313">To acquire an apartment, a perspective tenant had to buy 18 shares of stock in the project for each room in the apartment which he was to occupy.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.242" offset="300931">Construction cost greatly exceeded estimates resulting in substantial increases in the rental charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.015" offset="331964">The plaintiffs in this suit are tenants who claimed that the information bulletin contained misstatements of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.197" offset="368744">The defendants are the various parties that sponsored, constructed, and now operate Co-op City.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.325" offset="401241">The suit was brought in a federal court on the theory that the sale of shares was subject to the anti provision -- antifraud provisions of the Federal Securities Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.275" offset="445022">The sole issue in the case before us is whether these shares constitute securities within the meaning of the federal Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.311" offset="481176">Jurisdiction of the federal court turns on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.630" offset="502491">The Court of Appeals answered the question in the affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.470" offset="517851">We take a different view.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.590" offset="526315">The plaintiffs were not investing in stock with the view to making a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.312" offset="545228">They were acquiring the right to occupy housing on exceptionally favorable terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.769" offset="571037">These shares possessed none of the characteristics of instruments commonly known as securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.469" offset="601861">Accordingly, we conclude that they are not within the purview of the Federal Securities Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.525" offset="625998">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.458" offset="637806">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice White have joined.</text>
