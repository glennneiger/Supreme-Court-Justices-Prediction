            <label>Mr. Joseph H. Darago</label>
            <text syncTime="96.188" offset="488155">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.868" offset="514800">The appellant Francis F. Doran sued here in as Frank Doran is the town attorney of the town North Hempstead.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.835" offset="554715">He is the chief legal officer of the town and the chief adviser to its legislature the town board made up of four town councilman and a supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.854" offset="614797">The town North Hempstead is located in northwest National County and borders on the City of New York, Queens County that has a total population of 242,000 plus or minus and is made up of incorporated villages and unincorporated areas over which the town board exercises its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.908" offset="723048">The appellees in this case are owners and operators of certain establishments that sell liquor, bars as we would commonly call them, and they provide a form of entertainment which we referred to in everyday life as topless dancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.746" offset="810402">On July 10th 1973, the town board of the town of North Hempstead undertook to enact the piece of legislation known as Local Law No. 1 of 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.342" offset="868707">Local Law No. 1 of 1973 became effective by filing with the secretary of State of New York on July 17th 1973 and simply stated it prohibited topless dancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.572" offset="945612">On August 9th, the appellees in this case commenced an action in the Federal District Court for the eastern District Of New York charging Local Law No. 1 as being unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.805" offset="1014575">On September 26, 1973, by a decision of the Honorable John R. Bartels of the District Court, the statute in question was held unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.463" offset="1085210">The appellant appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals of the United States for the Second Circuit and that the decision of Judge Bartels was affirmed by a 2-1 decision on June 26, 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.176" offset="1168071">Basically, the challenge to the ordinance and the decision of each court below, was based on the doctrine that in cases where First Amendment Rights are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.759" offset="1242363">An examination of a statute on its phase and a determination after that examination that the statute is overbroad will make that statute fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.968" offset="1303280">We submit that in this case that doctrine of overbreadth should not have been applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.580" offset="1357720">The statute itself, the text of which is set forth in the brief on page -- beginning on page 3 provides in Section 1.0 that the town board undertook to regulate and control the operations of public places used as cabarets, bars, or lounges, dance halls, and discotheques, and other public places in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.069" offset="1507662">It defines public place in the Section, it defines cabarets, bars, lounges and discotheques and dance halls and that defines the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.698" offset="1554160">It then makes it unlawful to appear with one's breast uncovered if you're a female, once lower torso, if you're a male, and both the breast and the lower torso if you're a female.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.266" offset="1620407">In this next Section, it also makes it unlawful to promote the same that is to present it as a bar owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.400" offset="1660949">Traditionally, the police powers of the community have been recognized by this Court in the operation of local governments such as the Town of Hempstead.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.557" offset="1721553">Just recently in the village of Boraas against the village of Belle Terre this Court upheld a zoning provision allowing a locality such as the town of North Hempstead, in that case, the village of Belle Terre to define and enforce the definition of family for the purposes of occupancy of dwellings.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.472" offset="1821236">It is under these police powers, that the town of North Hempstead undertook to cutoff at the source the basic and originating problem or originating problem of certain complaints that had received concerning the operation of appellees establishments and establishments which are owned and operated by peoples not parties for this action.</text>

            <text syncTime="515.513" offset="2165426">They have been in contact with us but they have not -- well they would have jurisdiction over the licensing of bars, yes that is correct, yes sir.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_h_darago" startTime="525.723" stopTime="1168.181">
            <label>Mr. Joseph H. Darago</label>
            <text syncTime="525.723" offset="2206281">And they've taken no action to my knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.745" offset="2222373">The public record of the public hearing held will demonstrate the types of complaints that the town board received.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.972" offset="2291231">Similarly, the town of North Hempstead town board recognized that one or more of these establishments were within a hundred feet of residential areas that peoples who owned the residence within a hundred feet of these areas had made specific complaints about conduct of patrons, litter, noise, and things similarly important to the town in enforcing and keeping this suburban community, the town of North Hempstead a nice suburban community.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.462" offset="2469177">This concern we submit is the basis of at least some compelling governmental interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.966" offset="2507212">This compelling governmental interest is a relative term.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.868" offset="2522885">What is compelling for the United States as a whole may be a separate and distinct item as to what is concern -- the concern of a local community of 240,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.756" offset="2578369">One compared that the other, one may look very great and the other de minimis.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.066" offset="2599685">Wherein the town such as ours who -- which faces the everyday problems of living, noise, litter, patron's conduct around bars and incidentally, I might say that the record would justify the statement that on bars that didn't provide topless dancing, none of these complaints were ever voiced before the town board.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.819" offset="2702608">That the town board acted in a manner in which it thought would best remedy to the problems arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.617" offset="2765824">Unfortunately, after the enactment, Judge Bartels found that the statute and used the words from Thornhill against Alabama by its wordings swept into areas of otherwise protected expression, we debate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.522" offset="2869478">Topless dancing is conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.526" offset="2877524">It has been recognized by this Court as containing a minimal of expression and even assuming if any expression is there, it's still constitutes conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.048" offset="2931545">One of the most striking facts about this Court's First Amendment opinions is their are absolute consistency that under a challenge to the First Amendment, the doctrine of overbreadth will be reserved to spoken words, freedom of expression, freedom to communicate one's ideas, freedom to gather and assemble peaceably to do just that express and communicate one's ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.663" offset="3118059">Secondly, important in this case is the appellees here assert the rights of others and not of their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.936" offset="3167065">In this case, the appellees, and I'm referring at this moment to the appendix page 9 beginning with paragraph 16 of the complaint, “The law deprives the patrons of the plaintiffs' bars of the right to view constitutionally protected expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.343" offset="3300707">The law on its face and as applied to the exercise of First Amendment Rights as so discretionary and vague and overbroad the void of objective guidelines as to restrain and chill the exercise of such rights.”</text>
            <text syncTime="814.042" offset="3359535">It bears no relation to a governmental purpose, violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.781" offset="3394539">It is interesting that the plaintiffs have not risen a -- excuse me -- have not brought up the subjects of their right to present this type of entertainment but of their right of their patrons to view the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.020" offset="3475414">If this has any element of expression, this topless dancing, it is further reduced by the fact that what the plaintiffs really are doing are commercionally exploiting nudity.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.999" offset="3531316">They haven't got a topless dancer or a naked dancer as they have now on the stage to express an idea, they've got a naked dancer on the stage to draw a patron into their establishments and to selling drinks.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.161" offset="3616057">As a matter of fact, their complaint although it has the magic words in it, chill, freedom of expression, belies the fact because they claim irreparable damage because when they don't have naked dancing, they lose money.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.409" offset="3692962">The ultimate facts that they've plead speak otherwise than to their claim that what they do is first -- is protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.357" offset="3740818">We submit that so minimal if there is any expression in topless dancing is this expression that it constitutes conduct validly regulatable by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.309" offset="3820648">Public nudity -- public nudity, nudity in public was a crime at the criminal law or at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.322" offset="3856697">This is something that the state has the power to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.623" offset="3873834">Certainly, the state can make a law preventing nudity on the streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.738" offset="3906330">Under the police powers, they can make this law and enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.806" offset="3926601">Similarly in a public place for the good of the community, they can prevent exactly what we have going on in North Hempstead now, topless dancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.728" offset="3978324">In California against LaRue, this Court recognized the minimal amount of expression in topless dancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.564" offset="4013641">Eight or nine jurisdictions in this United States has reduced that expressive contain even further under this commercial exploitation of nudity idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.383" offset="4064946">In as much as topless dancing is conduct and not spoken words or pure speech, the doctrine of overbreadth does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.737" offset="4110294">Similarly, the appellees contention that would prevent the theatrical performance cannot be raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.770" offset="4158464">In California against LaRue, this Court clearly indicated that it would be unwise or do what the service to the ballet to compare a ballet dancer to that of a topless dancer in a bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.425" offset="4225024">Similarly, the likelihood that any appellee here would have in their establishments which are small, local, community bars the desire or even the facilities that put on a theatrical performance such as hair or the ballet just can't be conceived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.346" offset="4328782">I'm sure that legislature of the town board considered the likelihood and the possibility of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.922" offset="4371101">Similarly, it may well be that should the appellees undertake to place a production such as hair or in their bar, they might be violating some other zoning ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.860" offset="4450826">Basically, it comes down to the rationale of this Court in its recent case of Broadrick against Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.885" offset="4490951">This statute with a fair reading of the words clearly shows that it applies for the appellees here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.850" offset="4526791">There within that hardcore conduct which this statute was meant to prevent, topless dancing; they vicariously assert the rights of others to perform the ballet and to put on hair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.011" offset="4599411">This vicarious assertion of rights even if it were in the area of political freedom, the right to participate in politics has been held by this Court to be no basis for declaring a statute overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.811" offset="4674644">We submit to you that topless dancing has been properly excluded and that courts below errored in approaching these topless dancers and this statute as if it barred free speech, as if it barred communication, as if it barred the right to express your ideas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1385.308" offset="5644622">I think that comedy is something that the federal court misread in the decision of Steffel that the federal courts are a powerful defender of constitutional rights and the rush to the courthouse rule created by the United States Court of Appeals overlooks that the state courts in which we all practice everyday are just as capable to handle a constitutional claim as are the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.710" offset="5786206">And had they not determine and I submit erroneously that this was a free speech or spoken words case or overbreadth case, they probably would have abstained and send it back for prosecutions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1486.395" offset="6048998">I think Younger against Harris made that clear as well that at any time, if the facts wanted, this Court -- the federal courts could remand this cases to state prosecutions.</text>
