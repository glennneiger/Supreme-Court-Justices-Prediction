            <text syncTime="122.110" offset="591809">I believe that in actuality it was offered, he accepted for a time and then refused to participate further and I believe on one other occasion when it was offered he said that he would not participate again.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.842" offset="662758">There is some question from time to time as to how he reacted when the therapy was offered and whether the therapy was explained to him at the various forms.</text>

            <text syncTime="214.019" offset="959404">Now, throughout his hospitalization he was tested and examined several times by the staffs, psychiatrist, psychologist, at some occasions he would refuse to be examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.205" offset="1012172">But each time until the end when it was agreed he should be released, the conclusion was always the same that Mr. Donaldson was mentally ill and his confinement should continue.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.171" offset="1228048">At that time Dr. O'Connor became Clinical Director of the hospital and another doctor took over Mr. Donaldson's care and later Dr. O'Connor became Superintendent of the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.638" offset="1285935">And towards the end, the new attending physician determined that Mr. Donaldson had indeed that improved to the point where he should be returned to society and he was indeed released in mid 1971, I believe it was late July or early August and at that time there had also been a change of administration in the hospital and it was the opinion of the new superintendent based upon the reports given to him by the physicians that Mr. Donaldson should be released.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.860" offset="1578820">Now, there were certain temporary forms of release that were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.055" offset="1595643">These were such things as trial visits, there was an out-of-state release procedure whereby a man although not restored to his competency and given a final discharge could be released from the hospital for temporally periods of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="402.388" offset="1712880">They offered him a trial visit with his family and he refused.</text>

            <text syncTime="1227.373" offset="5012877">However, we do quarrel with the ruling of the Fifth Circuit for what we consider to be important issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.287" offset="5032521">Examination of due process requires more than looking at the quality and quantity of treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.708" offset="5058226">You first have to examine the due process received in the commitment procedures which we've just briefly outlined here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3992.248" offset="16072391">The petitioners referred to various habeas corpus and other types of proceedings brought by respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3997.357" offset="16092766">I have examined all of the records of those proceedings I can find and I can state to the court that all of those proceedings were dismissed on procedural, jurisdictional and other non-constitutional grounds not relevant to the issues before this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4012.342" offset="16152743">There was testimony at trial by respondent that he did in fact attempt to use every conceivable statutory remedy he could use to effect his release but he never once got a hearing and the reason in fact, he did not get a hearing is that petitioner opposed those hearings by supplying affidavits to the courts and stating that his confinement was proper.</text>

            <text syncTime="4072.729" offset="16394324">That was a letter to respondent from the county judge.</text>
