            <label>Mr. James E. McLaughlin</label>
            <text syncTime="100.818" offset="506650">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.491" offset="521383">This case involves the issue of whether the petitioners here were properly indicted for and convicted of conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. 1955 when they were also indicted for and convicted for the substantive violation of 18 U.S.C.1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.698" offset="614170">The eight petitioners here were indicted in a multiple count indictment with a number of other un-indicted co-conspirators and charged among other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.431" offset="677073">First, with conspiring to violate Section 1955 and then charged with a substantive violation of 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.169" offset="716048">The petitioner Iannelli was also indicted for alleged violations of 18 U.S.C. 1302 and 1341.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.145" offset="763904">All of the petitioners here were convicted of both the substantive violation of 1955 and of conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.078" offset="803715">All were sentenced on both counts and in this case is before the Court here, each of the defendants, aside from Mr. Iannelli was given an additional two years probation on the conspiracy conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.973" offset="883231">Now, simply stated question before the Court is whether the application of Wharton's Rule in this case bars the dual conviction and dual sentencing of these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.165" offset="964002">Wharton's Rule is not at all a new rule. However of course, it was -- when it was initially applied some 125 years ago, 130 years ago, it was mostly applied in cases involving dueling and crimes of adultery, that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.956" offset="1039235">Now, dueling is not a very popular --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="235.993" stopTime="238.431">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="235.993" offset="1047385">It wasn't a very wide ranging rule --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_e_mclaughlin" startTime="238.431" stopTime="551.847">
            <label>Mr. James E. McLaughlin</label>
            <text syncTime="238.431" offset="1057102">No, no your honor, it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.777" offset="1070477">Dueling has somewhat fallen out of fashion and adultery is seldom prosecuted these days, so it really hasn't -- hasn't been applied as often with perhaps the two of them, but I don't think Professor Wharton ever really contemplated the Congressional scheme that Congress had in mind in Section 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.172" offset="1152084">I think he would've -- have felt that his rule would have applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.754" offset="1174340">But as you point out, Mr. Chief Justice, it was not a widely applied rule but it was a sound rule and we contended, it is a sound rule, and the gist of the rule is simply that when an offense requires concerted action or plurality of agents that Wharton speaks of it, then the crime of conspiracy cannot be added to the substantive crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.974" offset="1303280">Now in 1955, the statute clearly states that in order to vile a convicted, five or more persons must act in concert, own, conduct, finance, manage an illegal gambling business.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.159" offset="1379976">The conspiracy statute of course, requires that two or more persons agree to do an illegal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.433" offset="1413099">Both statutes speak in terms of minimums, not maximums.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.858" offset="1438804">Now, Wharton's Rule has never been directly applied by this Court but it has been adverted to in Gebardi v. United States which we cite in our brief, and of course it has been adverted to in a number of Circuit Court cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.489" offset="1521351">Now, in the application of Wharton's Rule in 1955, the circuits are not in agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.298" offset="1580596">They're in conflict and I assume that this is one of the fundamental reasons why we're here.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.953" offset="1603166">The Solicitor General did not oppose our petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.581" offset="1625736">The Seventh Circuit in United States v. Hunter has held that Wharton's Rule clearly applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.345" offset="1652799">The Second Circuit, which was the first circuit to consider the problem, has held that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.805" offset="1682578">The Third Circuit followed the Second, and the Fourth and the Fifth sort of went off on their own but also following the Second.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.565" offset="1721657">Now, we feel that the reasoning in Hunter is in fact the proper reasoning because they state there that there is no element or an early ingredient in the conspiracy which is not present in the completed crime, and we think that's what Wharton's Rule was all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.503" offset="1837432">It requires a minimum of five or more persons to own, conduct, finance or manage an illegal gambling enterprise to constitute the substantive violation of 1955. Now, we contend that when those five persons own, conduct, manage or finance an illegal gambling enterprise, they are in effect agreeing to do so and conspiring to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.126" offset="1963865">Now, the government takes the position and it in part is proper that if the substantive crime can be successfully maintained by a single individual, then Wharton's Rule in effect has no application.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.556" offset="2061563">And in aide of that proposition, the government cites a hypothetical situation at page 28 of its brief in which it indicates that it would be possible for a single person to be convicted of the substantive violation of 1955 and the situation where a single bookmaker hires ten high school students who are deluded into thinking that they're involved in a market research product and do not realize that they're in the bookmaking operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.174" offset="2216103">Well unfortunately, I don't represent ten high school students, and ten high school students weren't involved in the case that brings us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.402" offset="2256959">That hypothetical situation as Professor Wright points out in our reply brief might be very interesting in a law school classroom, but this is a real case and this kind of cases involve real people.</text>

            <text syncTime="551.847" offset="2310771">But then, the rule you're contending for Mr. McLaughlin would be a fact, a case-by-case application rather than a flat rule one way or the other?</text>

            <text syncTime="566.662" offset="2370017">I think perhaps it would have to be that way but I'm simply trying to point out that the hypothetical posed by the government, is just so hypothetical that it has no basis in reality at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="579.659" offset="2422053">Well, I took the government's point to be that if they could demonstrate some instances in which Wharton's Rule wouldn't apply in the administration of the statute, then it shouldn't apply at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="591.550" offset="2469595">Well, I think that's the position they take but the position we take is that they would have to demonstrate some practical, possible hypothetical -- in point of actual practice, any bookmaker who employed ten high school students in an aide or in an effort to operate a gambling business probably wouldn't even be mentally competent to stay on trial.</text>

            <label>Mr. James E. McLaughlin</label>
            <text syncTime="630.031" offset="2623509">Yes, well now, traditionally now, for instance in the drug cases, Wharton's Rule does not apply because a single person can clearly be involved in the sale of drugs or transfer of drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.800" offset="2686621">But here, the statute specifically requires a minimum of five.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.370" offset="2708877">Now, we just said the hypothetical posed by the government is just so unreal that it's not demonstration an instance where a single person could do it, and the actual, practical fact of the matter is that a single person can't do it and there has never been a single case brought under 1955 and there have been many, many cases brought under 1955 where a single person was charged with a substantive offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.302" offset="2856626">Throughout the government's argument, and this of course is a two-fold argument, one, we contend that Wharton's Rule in fact does apply and it applies in two ways in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.453" offset="2937187">One, it bars dual punishment and two, it in fact requires a new trial in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.674" offset="2982118">Now, throughout the government's argument, there is almost implicit in their argument and in their brief, a tacit admission that probably there is something wrong about the concept of dual punishment in this area, and they keep saying, “Well, if Wharton's Rule applies, then of course it only bars dual punishment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="747.744" offset="3094340">And I think the government senses, as certainly we do, that there is something definitely offensive about the concept of dual punishment in this area.</text>

            <text syncTime="791.900" offset="3270928">Well yes, and as a matter of -- there is a conflict in the circuits and the Solicitor General recognizes this conflict and recognizes in his memorandum in response to our petition that the problem is a recurring one and is of considerable importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.325" offset="3336652">And it is of great importance because even more graphically than in our case, the problem of dual punishment is demonstrated in the case of Grosso v. United States at 73-1412 which petition is here in this Court and is being held pending the action of the Court in this case, and I happen to be counsel in that case, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.746" offset="3446366">And in that case, the defendants were given the maximum sentences -- the one defendant was given a maximum sentence, consecutive sentences for the conspiracy and the substantive trial, so that there -- so that in that petition, it's very graphically demonstrated, you can end up with ten years instead of five.</text>

            <text syncTime="1740.627" offset="7065893">First, Wharton's Rule has no application at all to Section 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.934" offset="7087104">Second, even if it does have application, this case comes within a standard exception to Wharton's Rule because there were more persons involved in the conspiracy in this case than the minimum number required to commit the substantive offense.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark L. Evans</label>
            <text syncTime="1779.031" offset="7219493">As to point two, that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.532" offset="7233494">Third, when Wharton's Rule does apply, its effect is solely to prohibit double punishment for the conspiracy in the substantive offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.764" offset="7270379">It does not bar an indictment either alone or together with the substantive offense and it does not bar submitting both counts to the jury under proper instructions along the lines Mr. Justice Stewart was discussing with Mr. McLaughlin earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.984" offset="7323355">Finally, even if Wharton's Rule applies to this case and does bar an indictment, petitioners still would not be entitled in this case to a new trial as Mr. McLaughlin suggested at point as an alternative disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.731" offset="7378317">There would be no need for a new trial, all that would be necessary would be to vacate the sentences that were imposed on the conspiracy convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.409" offset="7409037">And I'd like to start, if I may just by briefly addressing that final point because it can be taken with the assumption that everything that Mr. McLaughlin has said about Wharton's Rule's application to Section 1955 and to this case is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.425" offset="7477060">Now, he has suggested in his brief and he had alluded to it again at argument that a new trial would be necessary here apparently because the presence of the conspiracy character in the course of the trial and in the jury's deliberations has so tainted the jury's verdict on the substantive count that there must be a new trial to eliminate this taint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.413" offset="7569011">As we understand the argument, if it rests upon the notion that in the absence of the conspiracy count, all the hearsay declarations that were admitted at this trial would have been excluded and they would not be admissible on a retrial only on the substantive account -- only on the substantive count.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.751" offset="7646333">We think this is wrong for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.318" offset="7656678">First, as we show on our brief, the admissibility of hearsay declarations of co-conspirators does not depend upon the presence of an indictment -- of a conspiracy count in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.046" offset="7699519">It depends only upon a showing by non-hearsay evidence that there was in fact a joint venture in crime of which the defendant was a member.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark L. Evans</label>
            <text syncTime="1959.065" offset="7939636">Now, even if for some reason the hearsay testimony would be inadmissible if there were only the substantive count at trial that the District Judge here contrary to the suggestion that Mr. McLaughlin's brief makes specifically instructed the jury that they could consider that hearsay testimony, those hearsay declarations only in connection with the conspiracy count on page 61 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.058" offset="8055620">He made a very elaborate effort to direct the jury's attention to the conspiracy count only last and he stated that, “This is why I start off with the other counts and work toward the first count.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.124" offset="8107865">That evidence, the hearsay evidence would not be admissible in proving guilt under the second count, the Section 1955 count, but it could be admissible under the circumstances I just enumerated with you in proving the guilt of conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.138" offset="8155930">So even if for some reason the hearsay declarations could not be admitted, should not have been admitted in this trial, there's no reason to believe that the jury disregarded the explicit instruction disregarded with respect to the substantive count.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.818" offset="8210683">Our contention in essence is that there's been no taint attached to the substantive conviction, in this case, no reason to remand for a new trial on that count in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.526" offset="8261465">The heart of this case is the question whether Wharton's Rule applies at all in the context of Section 1955, and before I address the statutory question, I think it would be helpful to outline our theory of Wharton's Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.938" offset="8327084">We start with two principles, consistent principles we believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.351" offset="8344743">First, that a conspiracy ordinarily is separate and distinct from its substantive aim because each requires proof of a fact that the other does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.478" offset="8377240">For example, a conspiracy to commit a bank robbery requires proof of an agreement between the two robbers to commit the crime, but it does not require proof that robbery was actually consummated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.952" offset="8423215">On the other hand, the substantive charge of bank robbery requires proof that the crime was consummated but not that there was any agreement to commit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.783" offset="8458533">And this Court has accordingly held in many cases that cumulative sentences may be imposed upon convictions for both the conspiracy and its substantive aim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.084" offset="8499702">And that is so because a conspiracy is thought to pose dangers beyond those posed by the commission of the substantive offense itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.700" offset="8534183">An unlikened attempt for that reason, the conspiracy does not merge within the completed substantive offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.431" offset="8561142">Now, the second principle as I say that's consistent with this is basically an application of the Constitutional Protection against Double Jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.403" offset="8596982">When one offense is necessarily included within another, a person may not be given cumulative sentences for a single act that violates both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.452" offset="8641181">For example, assaulting a federal officer is necessarily included within the greater prime of assaulting a federal officer with the use of a deadly weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.948" offset="8675140">It is impossible under any circumstances to commit the greater offense without also committing the lesser.</text>

            <text syncTime="2399.727" offset="9702275">Well, I was outlining Mr. Chief Justice what our view is of the proper application of Wharton's Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.252" offset="9728397">We think it applies only where it can be stated that the conspiracy is a lesser included offense of the substantive crime so that one could not possibly in any circumstances commit the substantive crime without also conspiring to do so, and the example that we used in the brief and we think is the clearest example is the case of dueling, which is defined in terms of an armed combat between two persons pursuant to an agreement to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.623" offset="9841873">Now, in order to commit a duel under that definition, you must agree to do so. You must in effect commit each of the elements of a conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.362" offset="9876773">Now in that context, we have no question that this is the appropriate case in which to apply this general -- whatever the general double jeopardy rules may be with respect to a lesser included offenses in greater offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.237" offset="9932361">When we come to Section 1955 however, this is not -- this is anywhere anything like dueling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.889" offset="9970918">I think looking at 1955 in recalling the central question, I think that our theory of Wharton's Rule is whether it would be possible under any circumstances to commit the substantive crime of conducting an illegal gambling business without also conspiring to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.848" offset="10046777">Now, the statute defines illegal gambling business as one that involves five or more persons who conduct it but it does not state and it does not imply in our view that all five must be knowing and willful participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.646" offset="10101948">The purpose of the five-person requirement like that of the other requirements in the definition was to limit the allocation of federal resources to the large gambling operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.538" offset="10157537">The requirement is one of size, not one of culpability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.744" offset="10170389">This is confirmed we think by the form that was used by Congress in drafting the statute, which is set out at page 2 of our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2548.590" offset="10297762">It declined to prohibit all gambling operations because it wished to limit federal resources to the major operations of major proportions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2595.909" offset="10486993">And for that reason, it chose five as a number and again, I believe it chose the number in terms of the size of the operation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2653.666" offset="10718020">We believe that Congress deliberately left open in the statute the possibility of prosecuting a sole bookmaker to use the hypothetical we used in our brief who hires innocent persons to help him operate his gambling business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.698" offset="10782177">And it did so because it realized that it may be that there were other people involved, but guilty persons involved, people who are culpable but it's not always easy to prove their involvement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2702.826" offset="10914670">It's a theoretical inquiry granted and there probably will never be such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.801" offset="10930552">There may or there may not be such a case; I know of none.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.619" offset="10941837">But this is a question of what would be possible and we believe that in this circumstance in which one guilty culpable person hires enough persons to operate his business to bring it within federal -- scope of federal jurisdiction that he would be guilty of the substantive offense but he could not be convicted of a conspiracy because there would be no proof that he conspired with any other culpable person involved in the operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.158" offset="11079973">Now, one might properly ask I think in these circumstances whether Congress really intended that a person who violates Section 1955 should be subject to the additional punishment for a conspiracy, which probably would be connected with the large operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.720" offset="11158235">But we think that this Court's decision in Callanan is an answer to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.466" offset="11177253">That was not a Wharton's Rule case but an analogous argument was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.389" offset="11192926">Callanan argued that Congress could not have intended to subject him to multiple punishment for conspiracy and obstructing commerce by extortion because both crimes were created by the same section of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.740" offset="11246320">The Court stated however that the historic distinctiveness between a conspiracy and its substantive aim gives rise to a presumption that Congress intended to maintain that distinction and to maintain the separate punitive consequences of each, and the Court stated in a sentence that I think is worth quoting that appears on page 42 of our brief, “To dislodge such conventional consequences in the outlawing of two disparate offenses, conspiracy and substantive conduct, and effectuate a reversal of the settled interpretation would require a specific language to the contrary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.959" offset="11387173">Well, there is no such specific language to the contrary in this statute and we believe that the presumption established by Callanan should be applied in this case as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="2908.725" offset="11738258">This exception has been recognized even by this Court in the Gebardi case and it's now accepted by the current addition of Wharton's Treaties.</text>

            <text syncTime="2921.351" offset="11788727">Separate punishment in our view is precluded by Wharton's Rule on the theory that Congress took into account in establishing the punishment for the substantive offense all the dangers inherent in the commission of the substantive offense, including the dangers involved and any necessarily included conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.026" offset="11863437">But when the conspiracy exceeds in number, the minimum number necessary to the commission of the substantive crime, its dangers are likely to be increased also.</text>
