            <label>Mr. Richard S. Kohn</label>
            <text syncTime="10.678" offset="146056">Thank Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.655" offset="150026">Good morning Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.498" offset="165386">The issue presented by this case is whether children who are in need due to the unemployment of their fathers can be denied assistance under the unemployed-fathers program solely because their father is eligible for an amount of an unemployment compensation no matter how small.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.935" offset="255143">The District Court applied the plain meaning of Section 607 (b) (2) (c) (ii) of Title 42 and held that the statute only applies to actual receipt and that the father has an option of declining to accept his unemployment compensation in accepting ANFC UF if those benefits are higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.271" offset="360469">Just a few days ago, this Court in the case of Alcala versus Burns applied the ordinary language rule and we asked the Court to do that in this case and affirm the judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.986" offset="419297">First of all, the language of Section 607 (b) (2) (c) (ii) is absolutely clear refers to receipt of unemployment compensation benefits is working the disqualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.317" offset="468616">The -- there are substantial evidence and other provisions of the same statute that if Congress wanted to say eligibility for receipt, they knew have to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.808" offset="514591">In a statute -- in the section of the statute immediately preceding the one at issue here (b) (1) (c), the Court had to -- the Congress referred to eligibility requirements for AFDC and the in the course of that statute which is enacted on the same day as 607 (b) (2) (c) (ii), the Court used the language qualified to receive and refers to another section of the statute which defines that as being eligible for the receipt of benefits upon the filing of an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.717" offset="646248">So, it's perfectly clear that if the Congress had intended to refer to eligibility for receipt in the subsequent section, they could've done so by referring to Section (d) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="147.388" offset="692955">Also, in Section 602 which is this Court knows from the Alcala versus Burns case has to do with the requirements of state plans which must be included if HEW approval is to be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.096" offset="755754">There's a Section 602 (a) (12) which has to do with receipt of all the aid assistance and that provision says that if a failing receipt or for recipient in a household receives all the aid assistance during the period that he does so, the family is disqualified or that person cannot be included within the assistance group.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.101" offset="851780">The legislative history of 602 (a) (12) which is found in 1950 US Code in congressional administrative news at page 3479, this is not cited in my brief, indicates that with respect to that old aid assistance provision, the Congress was clearly concern about double benefits that a family should not be able to receive both.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.761" offset="934431">And since the Congress used the language “is receiving” in that Section and “are receives” in the Section before the Court, we think that that is evidence that when Congress was concerned about double benefits, that was the language they used.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.462" offset="993259">And also in Section 602 (a) (15) which has to do with providing advice to recipients of AFDC about birth control, the Court specifically -- the Congress specifically used the language “eligible for receipt or receiving.”</text>
            <text syncTime="241.595" offset="1069746">So, it's perfectly clear from related provisions of the Act that when Congress wanted to refer to eligibility to receipt they could do so and they did on several occasions.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="252.441" offset="1113109">Do you have any specific legislative history that supports your reading on the statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_s_kohn" startTime="257.736" stopTime="474.134">
            <label>Mr. Richard S. Kohn</label>
            <text syncTime="257.736" offset="1134320">Your Honor the -- I find the legislative history very confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.471" offset="1153233">I can't say that it supports me, I can't say that it goes against me.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.376" offset="1168906">I think it silence on the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.120" offset="1179878">The only time that the Congress referred to this -- the disqualification of an unemployment compensation benefits was in a different context.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.863" offset="1222823">They were concerned about the situation where family was receiving unemployment compensation, it ran out in the first week of the month to the second week of the month and under the 1967 statute, the family was then disqualified from receiving any AFDC for the entire month.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.283" offset="1288547">And that was the question that Congress addressed in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.645" offset="1313938">I asked the Court to apply the rule that where the legislative history would tend to confuse the issue or sheds no light on it that the plain language of the statue should be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.337" offset="1376737">It's important to recognize that until from 1935 until 1961, there was no unemployed fathers program.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.909" offset="1407039">In 1935, Congress created the program, it was an optional program to be applied by the states if they desire too and they also made it optional in the states is to whether they wanted to supplement inadequate unemployment compensation benefits with AFDC payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.585" offset="1477674">And of the 22 states that had the program, all but three permitted supplementation of benefits and the obvious reason for doing this was the gross in equity of having certain children who may have received $20.00 or $25.00 of unemployment compensation and then in comparison with other families they could've received several hundred dollars in terms of AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.963" offset="1595225">Now, there's no question that in 1967 -- I might add that at the time the 1960 amendment was enacted, the country was in an economic recession and at the same time that Congress enacted this provision, they also enacted the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.434" offset="1669099">So, it's clear that while Congress may have regarded unemployment compensations the first line of defense, after 61 it was not the exclusive line of defense and Congress recognized that unemployment compensations which is not designed to satisfy the needs of the family might be inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.439" offset="1753109">In 1962, Congress had the opportunity to revoke the legislation or not renew it and yet they decided to continue it for another five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.348" offset="1796786">There's no question that in 1967, Congress made a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.469" offset="1817266">They no longer provided for the supplement but the big question is whether they intended to bar all those families that were receiving unemployment compensation for many assistance or whether they were going to permit the family an option.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.956" offset="1887169">Now, we argue that the Congress must have intended an option not only because the plain language says so but the equity demands it.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.992" offset="1939310">And we argue that this is not -- it -- this doesn't undercut the unemployment compensation system and that it certainly is designed to make sure that all children who are similarly situated are treated alike.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="474.134" offset="1999914">Well, is there ever been a time when the amount of unemployment compensation approximated the amount of benefits?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard S. Kohn</label>
            <text syncTime="483.661" offset="2038053">Yes Your Honor, there's no question that in -- depending on a particular situation the amount of unemployment compensation may exceed the amount of AFDC and in that situation, --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="495.228" stopTime="496.537">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="495.228" offset="2084237">Is that the amount?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_s_kohn" startTime="496.537" stopTime="611.021">
            <label>Mr. Richard S. Kohn</label>
            <text syncTime="496.537" offset="2089566">Yes Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.802" offset="2094582">It -- because unemployment compensation depends entirely on the amount of money that the wage earner earns and if you have a wage earner who's making a good income with a small family, the amount of unemployment compensation which is set at one-half his average weekly earnings could very well exceed the amount of AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.989" offset="2183293">But our point is that for low income families and for the AFDC population, it's highly unlikely that unemployment compensations would exceed AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.494" offset="2221328">Now, the state has argued that the Congress may have intended that unemployment compensation benefits in an inadequate amount could be supplement with general assistance which is a wholly state funded program.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.456" offset="2273155">I would refer the Court -- and that that general assistance could bring the family up to the state needs standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.634" offset="2305860">In our -- in the appendix on pages 29 and 63, the Court will find certain interrogatories that we served on Bert Smith who was a director of AFDC in Vermont and his answers to the interrogatories, the answers are on page 63.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.443" offset="2369181">And in numbers eight and 10, he was asked specifically whether general assistance would bring the family up to the state need standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.586" offset="2405752">And he responded that it would be highly unlikely.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.833" offset="2422680">General assistance is intended as a short term resource to deal with emergency situations, it pays the rent, it pays the oil bill but it's highly unlikely that it would bring the family up.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.299" offset="2472521">And as a matter of fact, each of the -- the named plaintiffs in our case did receive a slight kind of general assistance at some point when they were receiving unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.932" offset="2515048">And each of those cases the amount of the joint benefits was below what they would've received under AFDC.</text>

            <text syncTime="782.915" offset="3234983">I'm not sure it's true with respect to the UF program Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.287" offset="3252537">The UF program is designed to deal with the needs of children who are deprived of parental care support due to the unemployment of the parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.042" offset="3287542">Like unemployment compensation, the objective is to try to get the parent back to work and if there is suitable employment available then once the father goes back to work, if he's working over a hundred hours a month, the grant would seize.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.248" offset="3344384">And is the same with unemployment compensation, the big difference in the program is that one is based on the actual needs of the family and the other isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.931" offset="3379075">The father could have a marginal job earning $100.00 a week, if he becomes unemployed he's entitled to a maximum of 50 week -- $50.00 a week in benefits while the family under AFDC could be eligible depending on its size for many hundreds of dollars.</text>

            <text syncTime="852.857" offset="3514807">If the family meets the eligibility criteria for AFDC, then the amount of the grant depends on the size of the family and the amount of rent they have to pay in that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.984" offset="3559320">And in some cases, I suppose it could exceed his earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.045" offset="3599548">Now, if the Court agrees with us, it is a fact that since 1968 when this legislation was amended HEW even though its regulations says that it is the receipt of benefits that works the disqualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.907" offset="3659003">The secretary has interpreted this to mean eligibility for receive and the state and the HEW has argued that this interpretation should be given great weight by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.244" offset="3704351">We would ask the Court, first of all if it agrees with our -- and if it agrees with the District Court that the statutory language is plain then under Shea versus Vialpando there would be no reason to consider the secretary's opinion on the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.239" offset="3780315">At any rate, his interpretation has a clear variants with his own regulation which does speak in terms of receipt of assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.477" offset="3813230">The -- in footnote 4 of its brief, HEW has suggested that one reason why Congress would not have used the language “eligibility for receipt” would be that they were concerned about a gap between the time the father applies for an unemployment compensation and the time that it is granted with the implication that AFDC benefits should be available to the family within that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.787" offset="3914480">This maybe true in some circumstances but I think it would be a fairly rare situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.651" offset="3934020">Unemployment compensation benefits are available after a one week waiting period.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.354" offset="3952828">This is true in Vermont and I believe it's true in most other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.575" offset="3969651">Under HEW regulations, the state has 45 days in which to give an eligible person his AFDC money.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.512" offset="4013432">In Vermont, it's a 30-day waiting period and in Vermont, if there is any kind of gap between the time the man applies for his unemployment benefits and the time he gets them that is taking cared of by general assistance to tie them over.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.853" offset="4078738">But it certainly not the general rule that any problem would be created by that hiatus in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.862" offset="4122833">Now, we have asked the Court that if it should reverse the District Court on statutory ground that it should reach and decide the constitutional question and the -- it's true that the District Court did not reach that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.883" offset="4170898">However, it was fully briefed and argued downstairs unlike the Alcala case it has been briefed in this Court and we would argue that the exigencies of the economic situation require the Court to go ahead and decide that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.713" offset="4230248">The case will affect 25 states that have the UF program and there are many thousands of children who would be affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.108" offset="4271835">We believe that the standard review was that -- that was enunciated in the Marino case and some have argued that that is sort of a strict rationality standard and that the government must show that whatever objective the provision serves must be furthered by the statutory classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.405" offset="4353024">And it's our contention that this statutory classification serves no governmental purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.780" offset="4378520">And certainly doesn't serve the purposes of the AFDC UF program which was designed to take care of needy children and even if you -- even if one of the objectives was to try to make parents self-supporting and get them back to work that's taking cared of by provisions within the AFDC statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.909" offset="4467022">The government has argued that one rational basis would be that there's been a historical reliance on unemployment compensation as the first line of defense for unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.468" offset="4509236">I would say that for purposes of this argument, we would concede that Congress has not have to and not the UF program if they choose not to and that there are distinctions that could be drown between that and the situations described in Section 606.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.641" offset="4565974">But once Congress has recognized the problem and enacted an unemployed-fathers program it can't then divide that class of children into sub groups based on whether the father receives a source -- some income from a certain source and if that is a -- as irrational if they exclude a red headed families from the -- from that group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.911" offset="4651029">Also, as the legislative history shows, while at one time an unemployment compensation was considered the first line of defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.731" offset="4682271">Certainly was -- could no longer be said that that was true after 1961 when Congress specifically recognized that that unemployment compensation could be supplemented.</text>

            <text syncTime="1617.408" offset="6573014">I believe that that saves the case from mootness and I would also argue that even if it doesn't and even if Mr. Sarrison should go back to work within the next month or so that this is the type of problem that's capable of repetition yet evading review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.108" offset="6643754">When a man becomes eligible for unemployment and still drawing it, one of two things will happen, either he will go back to work long before the issue could be resolved in the Supreme Court or he'll exhaust his benefits and was brought out yesterday with the emergency situation because of the recession the benefit period is 39 weeks with the emergency legislation passed by Congress is up to 52 but it's highly unlikely that a case could come to this Court in that period of time.</text>
