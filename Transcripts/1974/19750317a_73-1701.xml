            <text syncTime="65.670" offset="366007">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.790" offset="378546">This case is on appeal from a judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granting the defendants motion to dismiss the Government's complaint in a Sherman Act case.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.570" offset="425671">The case involves interpretation of several provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 concerning mutual funds and the relationship of that Act to the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.916" offset="471019">In reviewing the many briefs, we found some confusion in terminology and some misapprehension of the Government's position in this case, so we've tried to address some of those problems in the reply brief we filed last week and we've also prepared this illustrative chart which I think may help clarify some of the relationships that are involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.551" offset="561612">Basically, a mutual fund or an investment company is a company that invests shareholder's money in the stock of other companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.706" offset="602154">This case involves the most common type of mutual fund which is the “open end” mutual fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.965" offset="627231">Its distinctive characteristics are that share are always redeemable by the shareholder from the fund at a proportional amount of the net asset value of the funds at the time of redemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.736" offset="686268">Although they are not required to do so by law, funds most of them are continually offering shares to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.066" offset="727646">Some however have for either short-term or long-term periods stopped offering and are closed up as they say.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.231" offset="768293">There are two basic types of open end mutual funds, the load funds and no load funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.948" offset="791176">The load refers to a sales charge that the purchaser pays at the time of purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.776" offset="814477">As a practical matter, the issues here involve only the load funds and it is to those load open end mutual funds that I will be referring throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.691" offset="866095">In the initial distribution of mutual fund shares, we have the vertical alignment shown in the center of the chart.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.689" offset="906115">The mutual fund distributes its share to a single underwriter known as the principal underwriter pursuant to an underwriting contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.225" offset="948224">Then the underwriter typically sells those shares to a large number of dealers through dealer contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.602" offset="977795">We've only shown one in the chart for illustration but there would be many of these in the ordinary scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.968" offset="1011231">Then the contract dealer, as that dealer is known, sells the shares to the public to investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.669" offset="1038085">Investor can then redeem directly from the fund or it can also redeem by going through the dealer or the underwriter, although we have not shown that path here.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.087" offset="1079672">Now, this is called the primary distribution system in the mutual fund industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.953" offset="1107153">There is also a secondary market and transactions involving mutual funds as with any other securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.718" offset="1138291">Now in the ordinary securities market, the secondary market is the one of most importance to investors that is where issued shares are traded on stock exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.200" offset="1184162">A secondary market provides alternatives to the primary distribution system for an investor if wishing to buy or sell shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.907" offset="1218957">Now if the investor can purchase from either a contract dealer or another dealer or from an investor either going through a broker or directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.574" offset="1265664">And because of the nature of the securities business, a security's firm will be acting in various capacities depending on the transaction involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.339" offset="1316760">The same firm can at different times and different transactions be a broker mean that it's acting as an agent in the purchase or sale of securities whereas a dealer meaning that it's acting as a principle for its own account and if it has a contract with respect to the shares involved, there would be a contract dealer and as to those shares for which it has no contract, it would be a non-contract dealer.N</text>
            <text syncTime="329.329" offset="1420727">ow, although the chart here shows contract dealer, non contract dealer and broker is three separate categories, the same firm could be in all three of those categories as to different transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.627" offset="1473912">The term “broker-dealer” is used generically to refer to any firm in the security's business as either a broker or a dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.818" offset="1510693">Nearly all broker-dealers are members of the Defendant National Association of Securities Dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.031" offset="1535457">That is the only association that has been registered under the Maloney Act of 1938 which amended the Securities Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.469" offset="1573282">That provides a measure of industry self Government subject to the oversight of the Securities Exchange Commission under rules adopted by and reviewed by the commission covering specified subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.369" offset="1632841">None of the rules of the NASD are involved directly in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.300" offset="1660531">Now, Section 22 (d) of the Investment Company Act provides in relevant part that if a mutual fund is currently offering its shares to the public then no principal underwriter and no dealer may sell shares of that fund to any person except another dealer, underwriter or the fund, except that the public offering price described in the perspectives, I'll return to that public offering price in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.143" offset="1795950">Also involved in this case is Section 22 (f) of the Investment Company Act which provides that no mutual fund may restrict the transferability or negotiability of its shares except in conformity with the statements made with respect thereto in its registration statement and not in contravention of any rules prescribed by the commission in the interest of the holders of all outstanding shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.653" offset="1914023">22 (d) has no direct effect on the price of mutual fund shares, I'm sorry, 22 (f) has no direct effect, 22 (d) does as I'll illustrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.514" offset="1965432">If the fund is currently offering its shares to the public, there's no dispute that the price to an investor charged by a dealer must be the public offering price price described in the perspectives whether that's a contract dealer or a non-contract dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.758" offset="2038366">Now that price is effectively the net asset value of the proportional amount of the net asset value of the fund plus a sales load designated by the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.117" offset="2095835">Typically, that is a maximum of 8.5% of the total amount paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.541" offset="2125511">Now the price from the underwriter to the dealer is governed by the dealer contract and that is typically the public offering price less a dealer discount which for 8.5% sales load would typically be 7%.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.976" offset="2195310">The price to the underwriter from the fund would be net asset value meaning that the underwriter gets a net of the 1.5% difference between public offering price and its price to the dealer.</text>

            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="534.337" offset="2240763">Is there no control on this load, no governmental control?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gerald_p_norton" startTime="539.053" stopTime="615.128">
            <label>Mr. Gerald P. Norton</label>
            <text syncTime="539.053" offset="2259571">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.660" offset="2266049">There are other provisions of the Act which provide means regulation of the sales load, other provisions of Section 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.777" offset="2314428">Now, there is also no dispute that the Act places no limitation on the price that one investor can charge another for shares of the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.412" offset="2357060">It's competitive market price there.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.117" offset="2367822">As a practical matter, the range is likely to be between net asset value that the selling investor can get from the fund on redemption and the public offering price that the buying investor could get the shares for from a dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.738" offset="2430307">There's also no limitation on the price that an investor can get from a sale to a dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.956" offset="2467192">Now by its terms, 22 (d) does not apply to sales by one dealer to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.253" offset="2492374">This is the so-called interdealer market.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.277" offset="2512436">And 22 (d) also does not impose any restrictions by its terms on sales by a broker to anyone.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="615.128" offset="2563845">Is it clear that the language, the word dealer in 22 (d) does not apply to a broker as well?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gerald_p_norton" startTime="622.482" stopTime="639.904">
            <label>Mr. Gerald P. Norton</label>
            <text syncTime="622.482" offset="2593311">Well, those terms are separately defined and as I've indicated the same -- any broker-dealer is at various times a broker or a dealer, someone who was acting in a brokerage capacity would not be governed by 22 (D).</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="639.904" stopTime="646.765">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="639.904" offset="2663006">So when you were describing the functions -- those functions are descriptions contained in the statute itself?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gerald_p_norton" startTime="646.765" stopTime="1184.546">
            <label>Mr. Gerald P. Norton</label>
            <text syncTime="646.765" offset="2690382">They are in part contained in the statute and in part a description of the industry as it operates and as it has been characterized by the commission to which I'll come in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.786" offset="2754539">Now unlike the markets for other securities, the market for mutual funds is almost entirely this primary distribution system.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.299" offset="2784528">There are no really, no secondary markets for mutual fund shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.899" offset="2806993">There's a tiny interdealer market.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.050" offset="2819532">There's no dealer market of sales to investors and is virtually no brokerage market.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.367" offset="2856835">Therefore, at present the investor has as a practical matter, no choice but to buy at the public offering price and to sell at net asset value.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.012" offset="2895391">With the development of computer technology, the potential impact or importance of a brokerage market has been somewhat enhanced and it's possible to match buy and sell orders in a brokerage transaction in a way that has not always been so.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.036" offset="2963519">But secondary interdealer and brokerage markets have not developed because in large part they have been restrained by agreements, provisions in underwriting agreements and dealer agreements which effectively either fix the price at which such transactions must occur thereby removing any competitive incentive or preclude brokers, dealers and underwriters from engaging in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.354" offset="3072815">The validity of those agreements is what is at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.537" offset="3101550">Now, the case is here in motion to dismiss so that the allegations that the complaint of course must be accepted as true and construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.134" offset="3135927">The Government's favor in determining whether there's any state of facts that the Government might prove that would entitle it to any relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.892" offset="3166960">Not necessarily the precise relief requested in the complaint but any relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.765" offset="3186395">Although there are some variations, the essence of counts II, IV, VI and VIII is that underwriters and dealers have included in their dealer contracts various restrictive provisions which either require the dealers to act as dealers in their transactions therefore subjecting themselves to the fixed price of 22 (d), or that if they do act as brokers required that they maintained that fixed price or preclude them from dealing with other broker-dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.744" offset="3318366">Counts III, V, and VII allege that mutual funds have engaged and entered into underwriting agreements containing provisions that either require the underwriters to impose these restrictive provisions in their dealer contracts or have imposed other restraints on the underwriter's ability to engage in competitive transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.027" offset="3419512">Count I of the complaint alleges that NASD and its members including underwriters and broker-dealers have combined to restrain the development of competitive secondary inter-dealer markets and brokerage markets through a variety of means.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.949" offset="3495163">And let me make it clear that when we talk about a secondary dealer market in the complaint and in this case, we're talking about the market between dealers, contract dealer to a non contract dealer or an investor sale to a dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.140" offset="3563917">We are not talking about a dealer's sale to an investor.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.687" offset="3586069">Some suggested on the other side that that is the market we are trying to develop or redevelop in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.789" offset="3610520">That is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.804" offset="3626611">As the complaint was later clarified, we are not challenging in the complaint any rules adopted by the NASD.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.843" offset="3666735">It is asserted that those rules deal only with the primary distribution system and the complaint here is directed at the secondary markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.148" offset="3711979">And none of these restrictions that we are challenging is required by any rule of the commission or of any rule of the NASD.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.315" offset="3748655">The defendants acknowledged that they have the burden of establishing some implied exception to the antitrust laws because there's no expressed exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.705" offset="3798183">And they therefore must overcome the strong presumption against implied repeal of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.144" offset="3823992">In this effort, they contend that 22 (d) was intended by Congress to eradicate secondary markets that had existed prior to 1940 and to require that all transactions and mutual fund shares be at the fixed prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.801" offset="3906539">They also claimed that Congress intended Section 22 (f) to permit the funds, underwriters and dealers to make private arrangements which would restrict any other competition in this secondary market area that was not precluded by 22 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="970.126" offset="3983862">Building on these premises, the defendants claim that the entire distribution, sale and redemption process of mutual fund sales including secondary market transactions is covered by an implied immunity because of the exclusive jurisdiction they say of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.559" offset="4069648">The District Court agreed and granted their motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.741" offset="4090337">We should note that the District Court did not deal with any of the factual submissions made by the parties on various aspects of the case and treated the motion as raising strictly legal questions and the various factual issues are of course not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.308" offset="4160554">But we don't believe that the language of Section 22 (d) with its plain inapplicability to inter-dealer transactions or the broker transactions or the language of 22 (f) will bear the weight of the defendant's argument as to its sweeping purpose and effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1355.827" offset="5526653">One is that they're trying to convert agency in action into some evidence of affirmative approval and that is something that there's no basis for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.745" offset="5566360">If the commission had been exercising a broad jurisdiction under 22 (f) and had been actually reviewing these agreements since 1940 and passing some kind of relevant judgment on them, they might have a stronger argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.082" offset="5615679">But the fact is that they were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.465" offset="5625187">That this -- that the restrictive agreements are contained in underwriting and dealer contracts, not in the registration statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.105" offset="5655803">They're filed with those statements but they are not reviewed in anyway that is relevant to whether there should be an antitrust immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.405" offset="5689031">In fact if we look at 22 (f), the standard under 22 (f) is extremely narrow, it's not the question of whether restrictions are in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.751" offset="5722363">The commission is authorized to prescribe regulations in the interest of all holders of outstanding shares.</text>

            <text syncTime="1415.286" offset="5764472">And this Court has never found an implied immunity based on agency review or agency jurisdiction where the agency hasn't had to give some consideration to antitrust or competitive considerations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1490.064" offset="6063626">So that the fact that the commission has had all of these agreements filed with it if it -- that is the fact and has taken no action is of no significance because the commission has not been giving them any kind of scrutiny that is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.710" offset="6118170">They have not been applying that standard in the past but let me -- let me just address 22 (f) in terms of its legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.563" offset="6161638">The defendants would have --they argue that 22 (f) gave general validity to any restrictions in registration statements imposed by the fund that were not contrary to some explicit commission rule that there is absolutely no support for that reading of 22 (f) in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.309" offset="6260590">22 (f) was intended to restrict the ability of funds to impose such restrictions by requiring that they be disclosed so that investors know that if they buy a mutual fund, there maybe some limitation on its transferability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.334" offset="6320671">The funds involved in this case do not have limitations on their transferability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.933" offset="6339062">They're fully transferable and in the same manner as any other security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.916" offset="6359019">The restrictions here go to the distribution system not to the transferability or negotiability of the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.610" offset="6381798">Those are technical terms used in a technical statute and is simply no basis for thinking that Congress would have used them to encompass a variety of contractual limitations of which it had noticed and still used the narrow language but anyway the 22 (f) stemmed from the commission's intent to restrict the activities of the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.841" offset="6466748">It was not imposed or suggested by the funds as a means of enabling them to deal with the secondary market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.687" offset="6498095">Indeed in the legislative history, they opposed 22 (f), they now see it as their salvation but they didn't want it and it was adopted only as a result of the compromise between the commission and the funds that led to final Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.624" offset="6565909">Our position and we think it is the only way that 22 (f) can be read consistently with this Court's approach to questions of implied repeal is that 22 (f) particularly where the commission has taken no action has no effect on the validity of restrictions that are within its terms under other federal of state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.693" offset="6654098">If they were unlawful under some federal of state law prior to 1940, they would be unlawful after 1940, if they were not unlawful then no effect, it left them where they stood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.819" offset="6702686">All it did was impose additional requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.153" offset="6715956">Requirement of disclosure in the registrations statement and the requirement that they comply with any additional rules that the commission might adopt, of course the commission has never adopted any such rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.528" offset="6761514">Let me just – while we're on 22 (f), the idea that the filing of a contract as an exhibit to a registration statement is the same as inclusion of it in the registration statement is also unfounded here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.724" offset="6830268">The registration statement is intended with the prospectus that incorporates most of it to inform investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.933" offset="6859107">The exhibits and all of the technical matters that are filed with the commission don't all get sent out to the investors so that an investor might well buy a mutual fund on the basis of a prospective saying his shares are fully transferable and then find that there are contractual restrictions on who he can buy and sell to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.331" offset="6940714">So not only does 22 (f) not validate any limitations, the type of restrictions here contained in the contracts are simply not within its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.440" offset="6997138">Now let me return to 22 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.660" offset="7030053">The defendants say the 22 (d) intended to impose resale price maintenance on all transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.179" offset="7060041">Again, there is not and to restrict the competition of the secondary market, there is nothing in the legislative history that supports that purpose, 22 (d) was first proposed by the industry as a means of dealing with insider trading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.042" offset="7123571">No reference to secondary market transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.651" offset="7137991">It was then incorporated in a compromised measure that resulted in the revised bill that was then enacted without change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.701" offset="7166203">Again, no reference to secondary market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.466" offset="7177279">There is not a reference to secondary markets and now the committee reports are in the debates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.881" offset="7194937">There is simply not a word in the pertinent legislative history that supports the defendant's attribution of purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.256" offset="7232345">Now we say that the language of this 22 (d) is perfectly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.024" offset="7251466">It does not applied to inter-dealer transactions, that does not to apply to brokerage transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.383" offset="7272887">On this, the commission agrees with us and has explicitly taken the position in its amicus brief here that the District Court was wrong to the extent that it read 22 (d) as requiring resale price maintenance in all such transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.359" offset="7336835">That has been the commission's consistent view and first announced contemporaneous with the enactment of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.583" offset="7365674">It's entitled of course to the weight -- the great weight that such interpretations normally receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.609" offset="7397857">Now, in mentioning the commission's interpretation and its reiteration of that interpretation in this brief, I think it fairly shows that the defendant's argument based on certain legislative history concerning the 1970 Amendments to the Investment Company Act in which 22 (d) was reenacted without any material changed and certain prior legislative proposals that were not enacted simply is of no relevance to the question of what 22 (d) means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.357" offset="7540799">The commission's interpretation has been consistent and has been unaffected and the statements that the other side has relied upon in that legislative history, we have addressed in our reply brief simply did not deal with the precise questions before the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.334" offset="7616658">One of the arguments that the defendants make in trying to say that 22 (d) ought not be construed to permit a brokerage market to flourish is that such a market would be impractical but the major premise is obviously unacceptable because legality is not governed by practicability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.626" offset="7697847">But even the question of practicability, we cannot accept the defendant's premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.031" offset="7731493">If such a market were so impractical then why do they go to such elaborate lengths to preclude it through contractual agreements?</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.992" offset="7767333">If it's so impractical, why has the commission undertaken in a 1974 report which the parties have made great reference to permit such a market to develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.458" offset="7829191">There was simply no basis for saying that this market cannot exist under 22 (d) because it would be impractical.</text>

            <text syncTime="2265.096" offset="9163734">Government exhibit 13 which is an interoffice memorandum from the Crosby Corporation in 1970, refers to the problem of dealers buying from the investors and selling again not redeeming and addresses the question whether such -- the dealer agreements should be amended to preclude those transactions and indicates awareness that to do so would raise serious questions under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.299" offset="9280554">There is knowledge that going beyond the bounds of 22 (d) presents serious antitrust questions so that it's not as if they were babes in the woods.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lee Loevinger</label>
            <text syncTime="2816.525" offset="11369514">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please it the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.206" offset="11380172">In the first of the great antitrust cases in the Securities Industry, Judge McDine (ph) back in 1953 observed the initial inquiry and the antitrust case must be in to the character and background of the industry involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.108" offset="11431790">Now, Mr. Norton has sketched very nicely the character and the operation of mutual funds, of the few points I may take exception too, however he has not undertaken to examine the character of the Securities Industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.326" offset="11480691">Well, all there's a limited record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.563" offset="11489573">Fortunately all of the facts of significance on matters of public record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.141" offset="11503888">In 1963 there was a special study of the Securities Market which has been referred to by this Court cited in Silver and Cartwright and another cases and therefore I have had reference to that as a source of available information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.814" offset="11562611">And my information concerning the markets comes from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.328" offset="11576717">There are two basic types or markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.587" offset="11585703">First, the initial issue of market for distribution of Securities in the public hands which is usually in handled through underwriters and second, trading markets for continuous trading and outstanding securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.978" offset="11635336">The special study says the uses and mechanisms of trading markets are substantially different from those of distribution markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.073" offset="11663653">The term primary is sometimes used to refer to the original issue market and the term secondary to the secondary trading markets and the terms are so used in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.706" offset="11702209">There are however two types of trading markets exchanges and over the counter markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.582" offset="11725720">The special study says that these are fundamentally similar in purpose and function but substantially dissimilar in mechanics and practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.271" offset="11756440">In the exchange markets, there is a physical congregation of buyers and sellers represented by brokers on the floor of the exchangers and actually at physical locations within the exchanges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.846" offset="11798758">There is continuous auction trading with buying and selling and the price fluctuating according to supply and demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.385" offset="11824880">Trades are executed quickly often and within minutes of the time the order is given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.945" offset="11843166">The market could function solely as a nexus for matching public orders to buy and sell although there are dealers on the market they handle odd lots and perform various other functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.268" offset="11884440">The over the counter markets in contrast have no physical place of congregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.798" offset="11902516">The special study says that such markets exists only as and to the extent that dealers elect to make them by standing ready to buy and sell for their own accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.806" offset="11946611">These dealers are market makers and in the over the counter markets, there is no mechanism for matching public orders so that the market makers are the over the counter equivalent of the nexus between buyers and sellers provided by the exchange floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.358" offset="12012753">There is also something called the third market which consists of stocks listed on any exchange brought or sold over the counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.969" offset="12039293">This exists almost exclusively to serve the needs of very large institutional investors often trading tens of thousands of shares worth millions of dollars and occasionally these are brokered transactions because there's enough involved so if they can go off and look for buyers or sellers to match the orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.738" offset="12106376">There is also been some discussion recently of a so-called electronic market resulting as Mr. Norton have said from recent developments of computer technology and electronic communication and it has made theoretically possible, the combination of the New York stock exchange, the regional subsidiary exchanges and possibly even of over the counter markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.220" offset="12184221">Whatever the merits or demerits of the so-called electronic mark, if they lie wholly in the future and are entirely theoretical, have nothing to do with this case because they never have existed, are not yet in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.829" offset="12230719">Now, as Mr. Norton had said, there are various types of mutual funds or open-ended management investment companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.438" offset="12261125">However, this case is concerned with only one type, open-end management investment companies engaged in continuous sale of their shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.447" offset="12293204">We are not concerned with the so-called closed-end or with the closed-up funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.881" offset="12314937">Mr. Norton said that there maybe occasions when an open-end company is closed up, that may very well be but on those occasions the sales agreements to which he objects are no longer in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.647" offset="12353912">So those are completely out of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.368" offset="12360808">In any event, all of the defendants here are open-end funds that have never been closed up and so we are not concerned with any closed up funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.426" offset="12393096">Mutual funds have been well analyzed and described in both of the majority and dissenting opinions in the United States versus Cartwright so that this Court is presumably familiar with them as a means of providing a diversified investment portfolio and management service, mainly for small individuals and institutional investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.466" offset="12469269">They have as was said the unique characteristics of being continuously offered through underwritings and primary distribution and of being required to buy back any outstanding shares at any time of the net asset value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.492" offset="12525380">Thus, the price of funds is not set as are the price of almost all other securities by supply and demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.568" offset="12553592">In the first place, the supply is practically unlimited so there would be no limitation on that side of the equation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.925" offset="12575117">In the second place, the price depends upon the net asset value which is based on the market value of the underlying portfolio securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.955" offset="12607195">This is simply determined mathematically by a clerk in the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.643" offset="12621928">There is no management discretion involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.577" offset="12629661">That's a pure mathematical computation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.550" offset="12641573">Furthermore, although the Government talks about a restriction or restraint of competition here, there is vigorous competition between funds based on performance, portfolio, selection of type and nature of operation and various other characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.135" offset="12695907">There is vigorous inter fund competition and there is no contention to the contrary here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3167.704" offset="12774170">The Government is addressing its case solely to the fact that as to within the organization of a single problem, the dealers engaged in the distribution of a single fund do not compete as the load.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lee Loevinger</label>
            <text syncTime="3229.461" offset="13021184">That's a very good question, Mr. Justice and that brings me to the next point which is that mutual funds are and have been as found by the SEC dependent upon their primary distribution system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.179" offset="13064129">By and large, the demand for fund shares is the result of advertising a sales promotion efforts by the under writers and the dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.841" offset="13094745">Furthermore, for funds that do have loads and are thus dependent continuous cash flow from their sales is necessary to provide the cash for redemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.157" offset="13132048">Without such continuing sales, the funds would be forced to sell our portfolio securities in order to meet the demands for redemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.717" offset="13162245">This would tend to depress the markets and ultimately make the funds self liquidating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.267" offset="13180426">This method of distribution incidentally is rather logical for mutual funds because as I've mentioned, trading markets exist to redistribute outstanding shares previously distributed by the issuer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.103" offset="13227760">For most securities, this is as Mr. Norton correctly said the most important market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.527" offset="13245524">However, since mutual funds are continuously being issued and repurchased by the issuer, there is no function for the secondary market to perform at all analogous to the secondary market trading function for other securities and as noted in Cartwright, this method of distribution is now mandated by statute and under the statutory scheme, the redemption of shares by funds is the market and the only market for investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.337" offset="13360671">Now, before 1940 when the Investment Company Act was passed, there was a secondary dealer's market in mutual funds by non-contract dealers which was referred to as the bootleg market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.155" offset="13408005">Non-contract dealers would buy from stock holders at slightly below the net asset value and resell to investors at slightly below the public offering price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.144" offset="13443950">They could do this because they eliminated the underwriting fee which at that time was substantially higher than it is today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.812" offset="13470595">There never has been prior to 1940 or since then a secondary brokerage market in mutual funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.158" offset="13499956">This simply has been nonexistent for two compelling reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.058" offset="13515630">First, it has been functionally impractical because there was simply no way for brokers to function in and over the counter market except on very large transactions where the brokerage commission would enable them to go out and search for buyers or sellers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.190" offset="13588146">Incidentally, it's unethical for brokers to seek to get fund investors to sell their fund shares because they were guarded as long-term investments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.799" offset="13630568">The second is that it's been economically unprofitable because the brokerage commissions have always been less than the dealer's markups on mutual funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.022" offset="13667453">Now in 1935, Congress directed an extensive study of investment companies and after four years, the SEC submitted its investment study to Congress as a result of which Congress in 1940 enacted the Investment Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.201" offset="13724191">The congressional intent contrary to the representations of the government clearly was to restrain and inhibit the growth of a secondary trading market in mutual fund shares in order to maintain the primary distribution system and protect it against disruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.506" offset="13789393">Mr. Norton has suggested that there is no testimony to this effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3631.959" offset="14631163">However, there is ample authority under other sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.135" offset="14643911">Under 22 (b), there is an expressed antitrust exemption for control of sales loads by the SEC and by the NASD, 22 (d) sets the price however Section 6 (c) of the Investment Company Act gives the SEC full exemptive power as the Department of Justice has often urged before the SEC so that the SEC in Section 38 gives the SEC power to promulgate any rules and regulations of likes to implement of the other sections of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3722.091" offset="14991757">It has been estimated, it was approximately as large perhaps, it tried for larger than the primary distribution market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.923" offset="15015058">Since 1940, the secondary market has disappeared except for what the SEC refers to as miniscule market and which all the parties agree amount to less than 1/10 to one percent of the total market and that has been entirely the result of the passage of The Investment Company Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3759.455" offset="15141177">Consequently it's the only thing to which we can attribute the disappearance of the secondary market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.065" offset="15159672">Furthermore, the protest from the secondary market dealers which are in the record largely as Government exhibits show that in fact these were -- that this was what the secondary market dealers saw as driving them out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.677" offset="15226128">The reason for this is fairly simple you see, because as I explained you have to understand the mechanism of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.162" offset="15248071">In the secondary market, secondary trading markets, there are enough brokers for transactions of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.711" offset="15274193">There are only dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.436" offset="15281089">The Government admits, both in its main and its reply brief as I recall, page two of the reply brief that Section 22 (d) applies to all sales by all dealers regardless of the capacity in which they are acting are the market, in which they are acting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.242" offset="15340335">Since secondary market dealers can not offer an investor any advantage in selling price, there is simply no function for the secondary market anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.570" offset="15377638">Therefore, the Investment Company Act wiped out the secondary market in 1940 and it exists as a minuscule thing or a curiosity, I assume largely is a matter of convenience among dealers and for other peripheral things but obviously not of any real importance.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lee Loevinger</label>
            <text syncTime="4155.694" offset="16726183">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="4156.077" offset="16727646">These are the agreements that are attacking constitutional way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4161.089" offset="16747708">Now, actually the existence of agreements is required by rule 26 of the NASD which is of course not under attack and the restrictions on the sales fund, on the fund sales are we maintain plainly authorized by Section 22 (f) so that indeed it does come down to the question of what is this case all about and let me quote from the Government brief to suggest what the case maybe about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.419" offset="16857004">The Government brief says at page 9, that the secondary dealer market does not ordinarily produce any monetary advantage to a buying investor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4198.949" offset="16899218">Furthermore, if this leads to the conclusion on Government brief at page 34, that the prices in a competitive secondary market are not likely to differ substantially from the price established in a primary distribution chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4215.235" offset="16964315">Consequently, one is really entitled to ask why has the Government brought and why does it pursue this case and we believe that it is because it is dissatisfied with its efforts to get the SEC to act immediately to exempt or abolish Section 22 (d) and to get Congress to repeal 22 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="4236.689" offset="17050102">There were three exhaustive studies presented to Congress in 1962, 1963, and 1966 on the securities markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.364" offset="17080822">There was four years of hearing from 1967 through 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="4248.666" offset="17098062">The Department of Justice contended that 22 (d) should be repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4252.732" offset="17114258">The SEC said, no, don't repeal 22 (d) but impose a flat statutory maximum of 5% on sales loads.</text>
            <text syncTime="4261.341" offset="17148740">Congress rejected both proposals and in a legislative -- with a legislative history that is perfectly clear that they were talking about the protections of primary distribution system against any secondary trading markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="4276.244" offset="17208299">They reenacted Section 22 (d) in full in 1970 with the full knowledge that since 1940 to 1970, the action of 22 (d) and the Investment Company Act had in fact eliminated the secondary markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.867" offset="17278830">This was fully explained, it was fully explored, there are numerous statements by senators representatives and witnesses in the -- before the Congress during the period, 1967 to 1970 so that we must look to the 1970 enactment of Section 22 (d) to see that Congress was fully aware that in enacting Section 22 (d) and the other provisions of the Investment Company Act which were fully reexamined, it knew it was eliminating the secondary trading markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="4330.527" offset="17425429">Furthermore, I think that if the Court will look at all of the provisions of this extremely complicated and complex statute coupled with the provisions of the Maloney Act, it will see that regardless of the technical construction that maybe put on the specific terms of particular sections that there can be no real quarrel with what the SEC states as the basis of its interest in this case and in its brief at 19 where it says, the Investment Company Act of 1940 vests in the commission pervasive authority to regulate the process of distributing mutual fund shares and then roll a retail price maintenance therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="4366.280" offset="17568475">Furthermore, I call the Court's attention to the fact that the Government has sought to file its brief in Gordon in this case as further elucidation or part of its position and in the Government's brief, as amicus in Gordon it says at page 35, it attempts to distinguish this case from the case of the exchange and it says in the Maloney Act, Congress expressly incorporated antitrust principles and made that the duty of the SEC to enforce them as applied to associations of over the counter dealers, thus trying the strengthen this positioning against in Gordon by pointing to fact that here, in fact there was an antitrust duty resting on the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="4407.193" offset="17732106">Now, we submit that under the prevailing precedence of this Court, this complaint must be dismissed and I think this is perfectly clear from the Pan American case and the Hughes Tool case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.800" offset="17778604">In Pan American, the Court said the acts charged as antitrust violation are precise ingredients of the Court's authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4426.415" offset="17809011">If the Courts were to intrude independently with their construction of the antitrust laws, two regimes might collide.</text>
            <text syncTime="4432.510" offset="17833462">Dismissal of antitrust suits where an administrator remedy supersede at the judicial one is the usual course.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.754" offset="17862405">In those cases however, the CAD which was the administrative agency that was involved, filed briefs on the side of the defendants and said it had neither the competence nor the authority to control the acts alleged as antitrust violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4453.607" offset="17917785">Here in contrast, the SEC is coming in, saying it has both the competence and the authority to control for these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4462.292" offset="17952580">Now let me speak for just a minute about the diagram which is said to elucidate the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4469.051" offset="17979538">In the first place, it omits and distorts the time dimension, the vertical transactions are all virtually simultaneous transactions whereas the horizontal and diagonal transactions take place at different times and so are not comparable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4484.433" offset="18041083">One firm cannot, contrary to Mr. Norton's assertion be a contract dealer and a not contract dealer at the same time with respect to the same fund of one for maybe a contract dealer as to one fund in a non contract dealer as to another fund but that's irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4501.041" offset="18107538">You can't be both a contract dealer and a not contract dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4504.231" offset="18120286">Second, since there is not and never has been a brokerage market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4510.190" offset="18144110">The drawing of this thing called broke over here is simply lies on the paper that doesn't correspond to any reality for the same reason the transaction label Y is simply imaginary because there isn't any such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4523.797" offset="18198549">Third place, the transaction marked by the same symbol X is not a secondary trading market transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4529.579" offset="18221641">It is clearly part of the primary distribution system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4532.735" offset="18234284">As part of the primary distribution system, the X transaction is subject to regulation by both the NASD and the SEC, both under Section 22 (f) and rule 26 of the NASD.</text>
            <text syncTime="4545.715" offset="18286216">The Government brief indeed admits at page 53 that Section 22 (d) permits the NASD and the commission to regulate price and sales loads in connection with the primary distribution market and the SEC is addressing itself to the inter-dealer market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4561.385" offset="18348910">Furthermore, transaction X is forbidden by rule 26 of the NASD which in effect provides that only contract dealers are entitled to discounts and that they shall purchase only in order to fill investor's orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.475" offset="18413275">Consequently, there's simply no economic incentive and no functional purpose served by transaction X.</text>
            <text syncTime="4583.555" offset="18437622">Now, since transaction Y is imaginary and non-existent and since transaction X is prohibited by rules which are not now attacked by the Government, there is simply no transaction shown on this diagram which is restrained by any conduct of the defendants which is under attack in this lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="4970.351" offset="19984802">I think the beginning of this case is to take a good hard look at the nature of the open end mutual fund business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4979.599" offset="20021791">Now, between the Government counsel and counsel for the litigants, private litigants, you had a rather full exposition of the way the market operates and quite a lot said about the legislative history but I think the starting point is perhaps even back of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4997.954" offset="20095143">The mutual fund shares are not marketed in the way that General Motors stock is.</text>
            <text syncTime="5004.587" offset="20121684">You don't buy it in the market place at an auction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5008.929" offset="20139133">The mutual fund makes a continuous offering of its shares which it has to do in order to meet the redemptions which the law requires it to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.471" offset="20185213">In order to make continuous sales of mutual fund shares, there has to be a primary distribution system that will hopefully keep up their new sales parallel with if not in excess of their redemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5036.765" offset="20250415">If you don't have that result, the fund is going to be forced into a gradual liquidation and eventually will have to go out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="5046.942" offset="20291166">I think that when you bear that in mind, it puts the importance of the primary distribution system that Congress has seen fit to try to protect in a much stronger light than you might otherwise consider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5063.175" offset="20356054">I think it's very important that we do take that into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="5068.170" offset="20376012">Now, I'd like next to touch upon one aspect of the Government's argument which I think is highly technical and exults form over substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5085.159" offset="20444035">They say that the contracts that exist between the fund and the underwriter and in turn between the underwriter and the contract dealers are not sustainable under Section 22 (f) as being restrictions on transferability.</text>
            <text syncTime="5107.885" offset="20534941">They say apparently that you have to have something that's written on the face of the stock certificate or expressed in some other way but as long as these contracts are filed with the SEC as they are and always have been since the 1940 Act was adopted and as long as they are incorporated into the registration statement I can see no basis for saying that they don't fully comply with Section 22 (f).</text>

            <text syncTime="5223.643" offset="20997935">But, the Commission has exercised cast surveillance in this whole area all throughout the history of the Investment Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5231.228" offset="21028237">The only thing it hasn't done is to adapt a specific rule under 22 (f) because it has never found occasion to take exception to the NASD's rules in this area which it has carefully reviewed and kept track of and commented upon from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5249.790" offset="21102529">Indeed, the Joint Appendix here contains some conferences between the representatives of the Commission in the NASD which show that there was mutual consultation on the limits of these things and what should be done in these areas.</text>

            <text syncTime="5593.975" offset="22479287">We're going to submit to Congress to -- too broad in our powers in some of these respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="5598.956" offset="22499244">And someone asked the question earlier in the argument as to whether or not we had any reaction from Congress as a result of the report we submitted last November, some 130 or 140 pages long.</text>
            <text syncTime="5613.373" offset="22556818">The answer is that there -- the committees of the Congress are still waiting for us to send over a draft to actual bills that do incorporate or implement some of these suggestions that are made in this report.</text>
            <text syncTime="5630.547" offset="22625573">So the commission is actively studying this whole situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5635.794" offset="22646575">Has some ideas of its own that indicate that maybe this system as it is now isn't perfect and maybe it needs some changes, maybe it needs some changes, maybe it needs some relaxing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5644.083" offset="22679698">But they want to go about it in a cautious, judicious manner and not just chop it off by an antitrust court decree that says the whole primary distribution system no longer needs any protection which is I think virtually where you might end up if you had an antitrust court decision in favor of the government in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5725.553" offset="23005602">And as far as it goes, I don't see it's an Act, it's word for word, the way our report reads.</text>
            <text syncTime="5731.742" offset="23030366">It says that an exaggerated fear of disorderly distribution should not be permitted before my pretext for avoiding the introduction of price competition which -- while perhaps difficult and even unprofitable for particular funds and their underwriters and certain dealers would be to the benefit of an investors and the mutual fund industry generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="5755.251" offset="23124407">Now, the thing that the Government's brief does not do is -- include the first word of that sentence which was however, it's a however sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="5930.693" offset="23826160">I'd like to address one comment by Mr. Loevinger.</text>
            <text syncTime="5935.508" offset="23845386">He said that these contracts have been in existence before and after the Investment Company Act that the only thing that happened was the enactment of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5947.399" offset="23892929">Well, it is true that investment companies study show that there were some such contractual restrictions in existence prior to 1940 did not indicate that they had become widespread and virtually the norm the way they are now.</text>
            <text syncTime="5963.997" offset="23959385">This is indeed part of count 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="5967.241" offset="23972342">Count 1 says that they have combined to restrain the development of secondary markets and one of the ways in which they have done it is to induce funds and underwriters to include these restrictive provisions in their vertical agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="5987.969" offset="24055202">So that -- we don't have a record first of all on what existed prior to 1940 but it is inaccurate to suggest that there is nothing since then that is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="5999.763" offset="24102431">We certainly do not withdraw.</text>
            <text syncTime="6002.701" offset="24114134">We have not withdrawn or abandoned count 1 in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6006.109" offset="24127822">What we have done is qualified one single allegation of count 1 which could've been read as challenging rules adopted by the NASD.</text>
            <text syncTime="6016.677" offset="24170036">It made it clear that that is not part of count 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="6019.349" offset="24180799">The balance of count 1 which is on page 9 of the appendix stands fully in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6028.069" offset="24215698">Now, with respect to 22 (f), commission had conceded that they have done nothing under 22 (f) as we have indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="6038.578" offset="24257703">But they also indicated that they thought that they could act with reference to not only protection of outstanding shareholders but protection of --</text>

            <text syncTime="6071.609" offset="24389778">And the complaint is not limited to brokerage markets involving contract dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6075.563" offset="24405661">Count 1 is unqualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="6079.102" offset="24419767">Now, 22 (f) does not, as Mr. North indicated refer in terms, the protection of the investment -- investing public who are not already shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="6090.022" offset="24463444">Now, another provision that should be borne in mind in considering 22 (f) is Section 50 of the Act which provides that nothing in the Act affects the jurisdiction of any agency or officer of the United States or any state with respect to any person, security or transaction except in the possible extent of any conflict with something in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6113.594" offset="24557798">Now, there is no conflict with anything in an antitrust suit and 22 (f) standing alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="6121.516" offset="24589458">So, we have the statute supporting us in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="6126.442" offset="24609102">I should suppose also that the mere fact that a restrictive -- that a registration statement discloses a merger for example that would plainly violate the antitrust laws would not mean that that merger is immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="6141.205" offset="24668244">I mean that is contrary to do -- the facts of life in the way this Court has applied the antitrust laws for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="6149.079" offset="24699695">So if a restriction on transferability precluded the sale to a black person, that would be a violation of the Federal Civil Rights Laws and maybe unlikely but with current activities in the investment world, various things may seem more likely than we would like.</text>
            <text syncTime="6170.983" offset="24787257">That would not be exempted from the Civil Rights Act just because it was disclosed in the registration statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6181.170" offset="24828008">The commission's require that this is sent to shareholders indicate that the fact that the document has been reviewed by the commission does not constitute approval of it and is not any guarantee of the adequacy or the accuracy of any representations therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="6201.843" offset="24910764">As an example of that, in government exhibit 8 on page 254, the standard legend which belies any notion of the commission's function in reviewing these statements is an approval function.</text>
