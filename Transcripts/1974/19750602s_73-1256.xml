            <text syncTime="14.593" offset="58305">This case comes to us from the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.441" offset="69695">The petitioner is a general contractor in a construction business in Dallas.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.809" offset="91220">The respondent is a labor union that had no collective-bargaining agreement with a contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.878" offset="119432">But the union, by picketing a construction project of the contractor was deemed to agree that in granting subcontracts for plumbing and mechanical work, the contractor would deal only with subcontractors who had collective-bargaining agreements with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.381" offset="209502">The contractor brought this action to annul the agreement as a restraint on trade under both the federal and state antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.376" offset="249417">For the reasons stated in our opinion filed today, we hold that the agreement between the union and the contractor is not immune from federal antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.286" offset="293094">We remand the case to determine whether in fact, this agreement was an illegal restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.837" offset="323291">We also hold that state antitrust laws are preempted by federal labor policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.527" offset="354011">Mr Justice Stewart filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Douglas, Mr. Justice Brennan, and Mr. Justice Marshall have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.880" offset="391419">Mr. Justice Douglas also filed a brief dissenting statement.</text>
