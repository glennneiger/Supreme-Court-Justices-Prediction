            <text syncTime="15.606" offset="62380">These are three appeals and a cross-appeal from a judgment of a three-judge District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania that declared unconstitutional the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 and enjoined its enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.039" offset="144091">The ground of the decision was that the Rail Act would affect a taking for public use without just compensation of the rail properties of the bankrupt Penn-Central Railroad because the Rail Act precluded a suit against the United States in the Court of Claims under the Tucker Act for a cash award in the amount of any shortfall from the constitutional minimum in the securities provided by the Rail Act to be paid for the rail properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.897" offset="283585">We reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.658" offset="290586">We hold that the Rail Act does not preclude a Tucker Act remedy for any shortfall that may occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.206" offset="320784">Mr. Justice Douglas dissents and has filed a dissenting opinion on three ground one of which is that the Tucker Act remedy is not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.789" offset="363102">Mr. Justice Stewart also dissents and has filed a statement agreeing substantially with Justice Douglas' reasons why the Tucker Act remedy is not available.</text>
