            <text syncTime="11.203" offset="148146">-- and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.749" offset="158386">This case is now before the Court to determine the coastline from which the measure of three geographical miles that was confirmed to Louisiana in the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.247" offset="204361">In 1969, this Court reaffirmed it prior position in the California case that the convention on the territorial sea and would control in determining this coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.031" offset="267473">And at that time, they report -- they re-appointed a Special Master, the Honorable Walter P. Armstrong and referred to him same issues to be determined preliminarily by Mr. Armstrong and report back to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.014" offset="323480">The report has now been filed with this Court and exceptions had been taken both by Louisiana and by United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.519" offset="361409">The first exception of Louisiana deals with the fact that the Special Master failed to find any historical inland bays along Louisiana's coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.743" offset="410311">The Master first written a preliminary report in which he found that there was no historic inland bays and to that report we filed a motion to ask him to find special findings of fact for the benefit of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.835" offset="478751">Since he had said that the evidence on Louisiana's historical bay claim was undisputed and the Appendix 1 to our brief is a motion that we file with the Special Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.299" offset="540609">Now, that resulted in the Special Master making 16 special findings of fact which were attached to his report as Exhibit B.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.108" offset="583764">Now, these findings of fact were made after the Special Master had already determined that Louisiana had no inland bays along its coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.227" offset="640293">As we read the Special Master's Report, he is saying that these bays along Louisiana's coast would qualify its territorial bays and not as inland bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.370" offset="688880">We feel that --</text>

            <text syncTime="148.560" offset="697657">That they qualify as --</text>

          <turn speaker="oliver_p_stockwell" startTime="149.670" stopTime="852.405">
            <label>Mr. Oliver. P. Stockwell</label>
            <text syncTime="149.670" offset="702046">As territorial bays, historic or territorial bays and not inland bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.431" offset="725138">Now, we feel that the Master made this determination or the origin with the Government that only the exclusion of innocent passage of foreign vessels was relevant evidence to establish historical inland waters even in a bay and we, and now in this case, before this Court, the United States has not defended that statement of law that they all give to the Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.128" offset="851884">They are saying that while that is an important factor that there are other relevant evidence that would show that these waters could be territorial inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.864" offset="906846">And we say that these facts that were found by the Master which included briefly that since 1870, Louisiana had been passing laws regulating oyster fishing along its coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.361" offset="964838">In 1886, Louisiana passed legislation reaffirming it titled in all these bays which was shown on all the published maps and this title were reaffirmed subsequent legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.049" offset="1023561">Louisiana, though the Master found that since 1900, Louisiana had been leasing part of these bays for oyster fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.444" offset="1061177">And in the early 1900s, Louisiana had been enforcing its game and fishing laws in these bays and using as a line to demark these bays, the outermost mud lump or other feature marked in to see what inference into these bays and three-mile seaward from that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.418" offset="1145083">And they were treating these bays as inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.411" offset="1156995">They were patrolled by armed vessels with armed personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.475" offset="1177266">They required anybody fishing on these bays to buy licenses from Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.206" offset="1196178">And evidence shows that Mexicans, Spanish, and various other foreign nationals purchased licenses to fish in these bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.707" offset="1234213">And they also, the Master found that Louisiana had closed seasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.280" offset="1256469">And that these foreign national recognized Louisiana's closed seasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.963" offset="1279248">In 1946, the Master found that Louisiana arrested Mexicans in these bays and the arrest was made more than three miles from the -- any territorial three-mile sea within these bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.173" offset="1344031">The Louisiana started leasing these bays for oil and gas in 1928.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.021" offset="1363466">Louisiana past Pollution Law in the 1930s and it enforced these laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.798" offset="1390529">And Louisiana has exercised and claimed jurisdiction over these bays from the time it was admitted in the State in 1812 to the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.488" offset="1433370">Now, and also the United States has taken an interest in these bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.920" offset="1455104">Around the Delta, there was a turnout of game reservation created by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1907 and that was before you had it in migratory game laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.252" offset="1508394">Now we say, that this evidence -- this evidence clearly indicates that Louisiana was asserting to the world by this legislative act and the other acts that it was claiming these bays as inland water.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.266" offset="1568475">The Master found that Louisiana's title to these bays had never been questioned by the United States in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.318" offset="1600658">And in this Court, in its brief, the United States now admits that it has questioned Louisiana's title to Caillou Bay as inland waters up till 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.878" offset="1650918">And if this Court accepts the Master's headlands for Line E in East Bay, then the waters in East Bay would have been a juridical bay to 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.051" offset="1699610">Now, we say that the fact that the Government now has not defended this position that you have to have direct evidence of preventing innocent passage into these bays, that a legal principle that they now see is what we've all get all along but you could show these acts against foreigners to show that this water was and inland bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.759" offset="1802428">Now also, we are ordered to this Court and we feel that that jurisprudence supports it.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.641" offset="1825938">The way you have an indentation, like a bay and you exercise jurisdiction and dominion over that bay and establish it as the historic bay that it automatically become an inland bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.070" offset="1879646">Now under Article of Geneva Convention where they deal with historic base and say that it's an exception to rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.681" offset="1914128">It has provided that any waters land whether they are closing line is inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.419" offset="1937011">Dr. Bloom in his book which we cite in our brief discusses this very issue and says, that there's no distinction between the waters behind the closing line in a juridical bay than there is in a historic bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.930" offset="1999078">Now, we feel like that one of the issue that the United States discussed is been urged before the Special Master was that you have to have acquiescence of funds to these acts of foreign governments to these acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.571" offset="2073684">Now, in this Court they don't defend that legal principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.752" offset="2090402">They say that you don't have to have acquiescence and another issue in the before that Master was the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.886" offset="2134915">They introduced evidence showing that the United States had purported this claim in a historic bays along Louisiana's coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.832" offset="2170650">All of those Acts were after 1940 when Louisiana's title had already ripened as we see by these past acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.372" offset="2204818">And anything that was done after that as this Court has said could not dispossess Louisiana of its title because it would be an impermissible contraction of territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.295" offset="2248600">So this evidence was introduced before the Master to urge that we have to prove our title of this waters which we have treated as inland waters from the initial statehood of beyond the doubt which is almost the same evident you need to have in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.024" offset="2323519">Now, in this Court, they don't defend that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.907" offset="2335013">They say that now you don't have to have that burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.031" offset="2355493">Now, we feel like that in the United States also before the Special Master that there were no waters along the Louisiana coast that would one time inland waters that would not now satisfy the juridical tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.130" offset="2427904">Now, of course that's not true now because they admit that each bay at one time was a juridical bay to its outermost headland in 1918 which should be the Line E, and also admit that Caillou Bay was inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.526" offset="2485478">Now, they will making that argument to the Court, to the Master to keep them, from have to decide, having decide whether Louisiana tied had already been vested by past events whether or not the Government could dispossess Louisiana of that type.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.187" offset="2556113">And we say that where these bays had been inland bays and recognized as inland bays by the United States until after the Submerged Lands Act, they remained inland bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.388" offset="2604910">Now, they argue to that the fact that these bays are once inland bays are the waters for inland waters that that shouldn't be was in no importance and determine the historical chart of this bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.306" offset="2664573">Even though Louisiana showed that it exercised enough jurisdiction (Inaudible) prior to the East Bay ceasing the beach bays if they have already don't bit the test and as continued to exercise that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.133" offset="2731865">They say that immediately, if they open a bay immediately would lose its juridical characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.184" offset="2756106">Say you had a slight change in the headland or slight change in the water area that the count -- that United States will lose thousand of acres of land and you could not acquire that as a juridical -- a historical bay to the exercise of jurisdiction and dominion for a period normally to acquire historical title whether you had any prior inland waters or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="687.402" offset="2852968">Now, we say that that -- certainly that has no basis for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.881" offset="2870941">It shown no area in the world where you've had bays that had been treated as inland bays to now open sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.692" offset="2902183">And they also, and Mr. Miller who represented United States at the Head Conference in 1930 urged that where waters were once on the dominion of the state as inland waters and you remained and you kept jurisdiction of them that they remained inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.341" offset="2980760">And this was in keeping with the arbitration keys between Norway and Sweden and the Grisbadarna case where they say that a state of facts that have long existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.799" offset="3026526">In International law, they are disturbed very little and we say that it doesn't affect the emulatory of question of the coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.680" offset="3066128">The emulatory feature of the coastline is primarily relates to that part of the coastline that is indirect contact with the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.276" offset="3100505">This is changed by erosion and accretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.960" offset="3111163">But when you have large bodies of waters such as bays and straits, that this -- that principle doesn't necessarily apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.966" offset="3143241">Now, we head back to Brushiet (ph) for the Netherlands and testify in this case and that was his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.123" offset="3171871">The United States argues that if they would adopt the evidence that we have introduced in an international court that an international court would not say this to inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.550" offset="3213563">We had back to Brushiet (ph) come over here and he listened to all the evidence and we profound it to him a hypothetical question similar to the evidence in Exhibit E that the Master found and asking what an international court would determine the waters of which these acts have been taken and he said there would be internal waters under the regime of historic bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.103" offset="3299767">Now, we feel that his opinion should have consideration by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.383" offset="3316903">He is a recognized authority of which this Court has recognized a massive authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.881" offset="3338846">The same -- so we feel that Louisiana has proven that these bays are historical inland waters and that therefore the closing line of the bays should be as Louisiana has indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.957" offset="3407182">There's no dispute as we understand between the government as to the closing lines if this Court will hold that the bays of the Delta.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.566" offset="3437589">Now the only bays that are involved, Mr. Justice White you have that map is around the Delta and at Caillou Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.112" offset="3467786">Now, these are the bays that we see are historical bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.216" offset="3484191">At this time, unless you have some question, I'd like to ask Mr. Ellis to talk on the juridical question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1154.199" offset="4720201">Monterey Bay is a bay along the California Coast which this Court decided in 1965 was well-marked was landlocked, it had identifiable headlands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.768" offset="4774431">Now, the Court decided in 1969 that islands within an indentation should be counted as part of the area of the indentation, even accepting Government arguments that to be counted what area had to be part of the area of the indentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.339" offset="4852694">The Court referred to the Master then two issues, the well-marked question and the landlocked question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.336" offset="4884668">During the testimony in this case, Dr. Hodson, the geographer of the Department of State testified that Ascension Bay was well-marked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.572" offset="4925628">His disagreement with the bay be in accepted as in closed in in-lock waters was based solely upon the landlocked issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.836" offset="4958751">However, as we demonstrate it to the Special Master by comparison to the Monterey Bay map by mathematical data by measurement experts, geomorphological experts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.338" offset="5000756">As we demonstrate it by comparison to Mare Ferd (ph) by comparison to Egmont Bay by comparison to bays that Dr. Hodson himself had recognized along the coast of Alaska, this bay was by any comparison subjectively or objectively landlocked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.186" offset="5072123">For example, it had a depth of penetration 50% greater than the depth of penetration ratio of Monterey Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.755" offset="5126353">It's rather interesting to note in this Louisiana environ that bays are formed by the natural bank or natural levee systems of the Mississippi River or its distributors or its former causes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.016" offset="5187480">At this locale, it is the former cause of the Mississippi by first on the left or the west side of the drawing the Mississippi on the right was Southwest Pass which forms the pronounced headlines which were marked the indentation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1312.262" offset="5352469">Dr. Hodson incidentally, in his testimony he recognized that this land and he was -- is the geographer of the Department of State that this land forms were indeed headlands that they were indeed identifiable headlands that they were indeed identifiable headlands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.112" offset="5399803">His only quarrel with the headlands that were -- that they did not relate to this bay but related to pocket bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.324" offset="5424671">We demonstrated however by an objective test that he said should control over his own opinion that it satisfied this object test and consequently, we also satisfied the Master on that point as well as using a number of other technical test which satisfied him fully at all of the alternative line claims of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.725" offset="5514324">The Master found that each of the alternative juridical claims within this bay was well marked, was landlocked and clearly identifiable headlands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.141" offset="5555911">He required actually a steeper burden of proof than this Court asks for when it required that they be identifiable headlands and he found they were all clearly identifiable by use of the technical tests photographs, over flights and a mass of map data and information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.854" offset="5642742">There's no time to cover the various alternative contentions which were thoroughly considered by the Master in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.356" offset="5668760">The principle problem here turns on area measurement -- area measurement under the semicircle test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.256" offset="5696345">It is Louisiana's contention that the latter in spirit of Article VII should be followed in requiring that the area for the semicircle tests be measured by following the low water line and additionally that islands within the indentation be counted as part of the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.748" offset="5770324">This is consistent with the ruling of an imminent British trial jurist who considered the same problem in the Thames Estuary which like this area contains title streams, title rivers, and he held that the history of the convention, the letter of it required that every stream, every river become it and be counted all of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.627" offset="5861857">And he found that the line in controversy, they are satisfied the semicircle test by so doing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.140" offset="5887979">We submit that the President of the British decision in these Thames Estuary case is very well-reason and should be followed by this Court also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.591" offset="5937716">The only substantial question then is whether he was correct when he decided that tributary waters should be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.891" offset="5970944">The Government withdraw a distinction and say well some tributary waters should be excluded and other should not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.039" offset="5995499">This is a change in a formal position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.713" offset="6006262">They would say, well perhaps rivers or streams should not be included in area measurements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.154" offset="6031966">Let us note right now that we do not in any of the measurements submitted by experts, the mathematics of which incidentally were not challenged at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.931" offset="6063104">We do not claim any part of the Mississippi River Passes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.296" offset="6080554">These passes as part of the area measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.084" offset="6095705">The system, our technical expert recommended was to use the tributary waters to the point where they cease to be tributary to this bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.532" offset="6129455">The passes were tributary to the Gulf of Mexico and thus ad absurdum arguments to the effect that one could by the system go to Canada simply have no application under the recommendation of our technical expert, Dr. James P. Morgan.</text>

            <text syncTime="1564.974" offset="6363303">Incidentally, this problem should be distinguished in this area of county and islands from problems of headland selection in connection with islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.716" offset="6450239">You will hear the Government contend that islands with an indentation should not be counted because they should be treated as part of the mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.793" offset="6486497">We would direct this Court's attention to the fact that when it decided that islands may be realistically treated as part of the mainland that this was done after considering that the convention language did not deal with the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.344" offset="6544697">But in this instance, the convention language is explicit and it is not a merely a matter of technical language, it is a matter of the spirit and of the reason for the rule for there is explicit legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.627" offset="6593912">For example we have an appendix, Appendix 1 where we deal with the international law commission history among many, many other items in that technical appendix where we point out that Mr. Fransua, the repertoire mentioned that of the international law commission whose work led to the Geneva Convention mentioned that the rule require islands to be counted as part of the area of the indentation did so because of the fact that the islands tended to link the area with the land more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.980" offset="6739257">This is a reason for count in and being liberal in the question of area measurement not a reason for being restrictive in the method of area measurement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.284" offset="6772485">Similarly, islands at the mouth of the bays, they found that these tends to link the water with the landmark and the more one links to water with the land, the more reason there is to treat it as inland water and this is just antithetical to the Government notion that would assimilate islands to the mainland for purposes of water measurement under the semicircle test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.160" offset="6864018">Turning to the other major category of problems, island headland problems -- oh!</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.129" offset="6887842">But before discussing those, let me point out one other problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.262" offset="6924413">We have in the sketches presented to this Court which the Government would have the Court rely upon instead of the massive large scale maps and other technical evidence presented to the Master.</text>

            <text syncTime="1728.118" offset="7015842">Unless, the government position go unanswered that one can form an opinion on the basis of these mass sketches, For example, at South Pass, the Government sketches leave off the islands that form the tip of line A.</text>

            <text syncTime="2298.659" offset="9298004">These depths in this bay incidentally which forms a -- the Government points to and claim this is a situation rather like Sta. Barbara channel, I believe you here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2326.045" offset="9407509">Depths here on either side of the whole that the Government points to as deep channel but it's merely a whole one sounding as 23 feet between this on hold less than 5-foot, a vessel drawn more than 5-foot of water could not navigate through here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.006" offset="9483368">In this area for example, these largest of the island opens, I see Your honors, in location C here, the water depth is less than a foot as the picture in the record of myself and my daughter I've had taken by technical witness is hang up on with a 20-foot mercury outboard motor cannot navigate a small becto, cannot navigate through these openings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.610" offset="9605831">Turning to the size considerations which the Master deemed important, he found this fact here that we have islands that on hold and Your Honors can see this a larger, a greater in distance than the water gap openings and data is not needed, it's quite evident graphically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.697" offset="9698200">We feel the foot “No Comment” was perhaps occasioned by the graphics of the Government brief which showed an extremely small scale sketch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.087" offset="9735711">We have tried to point out in our brief, that small scale sketches can be misleading accidentally and that it is necessary to concede as the convention requires the large scale charts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.788" offset="9798510">We incidentally have a great many other arguments that selectivity of time needs have required us not to elaborate upon but of course we do not waive them as such as the chart matters where we maintain that Cahoon (ph) Island for line C which the Master found existed until 1969 that this should control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.153" offset="9895999">We insist on these arguments and merely imagine this so that it will not be misunderstood that we are waiving any of these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.178" offset="9936123">Incidentally, a number of the headland claims are supported independently by the application of ordinary headland rules as well as Island assimilation rules, it will be recalled this Court mentioned in passing that rules for headlands applied to islands and we have a number of headland rules that are applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.267" offset="10028492">For example in the islands at Southeast Pass we look at which are substantially similar to other islands in the Mississippi Delta that are claimed as Bay headlands and we haven't argued all of these locations and interests of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.515" offset="10077393">They found the apex of the salient which are the natural banks of the rivers here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.909" offset="10102993">Some of these other islands our a good deal closer than the Southeast Pass mud lumps to each which I've directed your attention particularly as the Bucket Bend Bay where they're very, very close.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.820" offset="10142699">Others are most distant as that pass the loop but all of them have this unique fluvial character present in this Mississippi River Delta, a very, very shallow waters the deepest water found between the islands in the Mississippi Delta its water of four feet and this is at pass elute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.789" offset="10230575">Generally, the water between the islands is less than one foot mere inches a child, a five-year-old child could walk out these islands, that is how shallow the water is and incidentally, out at the exterior headland islands that were claimed in the land that is very substantial and firm because you receive sands there but in the interior portion, in the Joseph Bayou area, the land in here is very, very insubstantial, very mushy due to the differences in the geologic conditions associated with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.198" offset="10380204">They -- this area has become nothing but mere spoiled bank remnants which we maintain ought to be treated technically as what they are islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.715" offset="10438196">In this Caillou Bay area, it's interesting to note that the principle water gap there involved Caillou Bay, Dr. Hodson admitted in his testimony was England in character.</text>

            <text syncTime="2643.654" offset="10678000">In closing, let me mention that the errors we point to in the Special Master's Report are almost exclusively errors of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.908" offset="10718960">A question of the correct method for applying the semicircle test, a question of, did he require the correct standard of proof when he required that headlands be clearly identifiable, not merely identifiable, but clearly identifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.618" offset="10781863">Did he require, apply the correct rule when he converted we submit this Court's mere fact as mere considerations to use the word of this Court into cumulative rigid requirements if you miss one of them even if you have this tremendous fluvial characteristics we have here which this Court felt important enough to talk about the pages in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.241" offset="10880293">If even in the face of this, if one fact a size or distance is not present as he did in the case of some of these mud lump islands, he denies that uses headlands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.200" offset="10932224">We submit this was a misinterpretation legally of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.122" offset="10943822">On the contrary, the Government's position whether the Government would ask to reverse the Special Master's Report as on headland matters, landlocked, well-marked matters at Ascension Bay and that East Bay where the Master rule first the Government ask this Court to substitute his judgment on essentially factual questions not pointing effectively we think to any error of law upon which his reasoning was grounded.</text>

            <text syncTime="2747.367" offset="11092825">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, I'll attempt to deal first with Louisiana's historic claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.660" offset="11130023">I approached it in this way and I suggest it proper for the Court to approach with a bias against finding historic inland wateres.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.122" offset="11179865">I say that because it seems to me there is a presumption against such historic waters that do not conform to the rules of international law or the rules of the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.687" offset="11230124">To find the historic bay where there is no juridical bay, obviously encroaches on the first principle of maritime law which is freedom of navigation, freedom of the seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.524" offset="11277458">Secondly, it derogates from the rules of international convention which tell us how to define a bay if every time an area which look like a bay did not satisfy the technical criteria established by the international convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.065" offset="11339630">It could be claimed as historic waters, the convention would become a dead letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.140" offset="11359901">It would serve no purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.734" offset="11366275">One must be hesitant, one must be reluctant to find a bay where the rules of the convention say there is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.656" offset="11402010">Thirdly, to find historic waters on the American Coast contradicts the consistent and very long-standing tradition of American foreign policy which is to view restrictively, narrowly claims into the ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.319" offset="11480691">That has been the position of the United States in its foreign relations ever since the days of Thomas Jefferson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.982" offset="11515277">And finally, in this particular areas, East Bay and the rest, it is of course relevant that the United States has taken the position that this are not historic waters and its taking that position not for the purpose of this litigation solely but quite consistently in its international stands which the view to foreign relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.839" offset="11610676">There can be no claim in this case that the Government has taken one position where oil is involved and a different position where international relations are involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="2948.338" offset="11896769">Only to this extent Mr. Justice Stewart that in both of those cases, the Court took note of the federal disclaimer and gave it weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.668" offset="11934072">In the California case, it was said that such a disclaimer would be conclusive in the absence of overwhelming proof, that's such a claim had arrived.</text>

            <text syncTime="2984.113" offset="12039816">That if historic title had ripened to any of these areas before a federal disclaimer was made and we take that to mean before 1948 when the first of these suits was filed then it would be good title but one must be hesitant to make such a finding not only because of the encroachment on American foreign policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3172.989" offset="12795277">The first is that there has been an exercise of authority over the area which indicates a claim to that area as inland water not as territorial water but as inland water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.547" offset="12853582">My opponent said that the Master had found that East Bay was a historic territorial bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.103" offset="12891826">Now, that is simply not the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.555" offset="12901543">On the contrary, the Master explicitly found that issue the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.265" offset="12924426">He discussed whether Louisiana's evidence was consistent with the use of the waters as territorial waters that being of course a three-mile territorial belt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.833" offset="12966745">He also adverted to the possibility that one could obtain territorial water title to an extended belt but his conclusion and that conclusion is quite explicit is that the issue which had been presented by Louisiana is there a territorial, are there territorial waters in this bay?</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.050" offset="13063607">He said, the answer is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.163" offset="13076041">Now, that is a perfectly clear when one looks at the report, page 56, the paragraph 6 says from South Pass to Southwest Pass East Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.865" offset="13150856">Sub-paragraph E -- I got the wrong, page 56, I'm sorry.</text>

            <text syncTime="3304.450" offset="13321174">He answered that question and that is issue 1-E on page 22 of his Report when he said the Special Master has constrained to make some of the finding in instant case and therefore issues 1-D -- 1-E and so forth must be in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.089" offset="13415737">Now, we come to the second element which is the continuity of the exercise of authority over the waters indicating that England character which according from the U.N. publication juridical regime which this Court invoke in its last opinion must be so long continued as to have developed into a usage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.921" offset="13515107">And finally, and very important is the acquiescence of foreign nations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3483.373" offset="14036825">Well, one can't draw a conclusion if there's no reason to go into his bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.688" offset="14066082">Now what is the evidence that Louisiana has presented to come to?</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.769" offset="14086457">I think it's fair to boil it down to rarely two claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.057" offset="14107564">The first is that over some period it has exercised fishing regulation within this bay and perhaps some adjacent areas including in that oystering and shrimping.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.606" offset="14165765">And secondly, it invokes its mineral exploration and leasing in East bay and Caillou Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.930" offset="14199097">Now, when we get down to looking at that evidence, what do we find?</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.218" offset="14212263">With respect to fishing first, any fishing or fishing regulation or exclusion of foreign vessels within the three-mile territorial sea proves absolutely nothing relevant to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.692" offset="14270151">Because as a matter of international law, it's always had been the prerogative of the coastal state to exclude foreign fisherman within that territorial sea, or to regulate foreign vessels or to require them to take out licenses and pay a fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.777" offset="14342457">Indeed, even as a matter of domestic law, it has always been the prerogative of the states within constitutional limitations only which has to say the commerce clause and the privileges and immunity's clause to regulate fishing within that marginal belt of three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.034" offset="14439528">And even the California case which said the states they would own the belt did not take away from them the right to regulate fishing provided it was done in a none discriminatory way vis-à-vis of the U.S. citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.726" offset="14498252">And indeed, the Court so held in Toomer and Witsell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.792" offset="14514552">Of course since 1953, the Submerged Lands Act has clearly confirmed the rights of the states to regulate fishing within this three-mile belt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.411" offset="14556975">So nothing can be made of the activities of within the three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.338" offset="14584769">Beyond three miles, it's of course settled by early decision of this Court's (Inaudible) versus Florida that regulation with respect to its own citizens indicates no claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.172" offset="14648090">Now, what about regulation of foreign fishing or exclusion of foreign fishing beyond three miles?</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.641" offset="14685915">Even that may amount to no more than the claim of a wider territorial season three miles and indeed during all of this period, Louisiana was claiming a much wider territorial sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.698" offset="14742131">It was 27 miles between 1938 and 1954 and it was nine miles between 1954 and 1960 when this Court's decision came down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.379" offset="14792913">And as a matter of international law, one is free under the convention to claim its matches 12 miles which would eat up all of the area of East Bay if one took 12 miles from each side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.854" offset="14838784">The basic opening is approximately 18 miles wide of East Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.806" offset="14862608">Now, alternatively, regulation of foreign shipping or foreign shrimping or fishing or exclusion of their boats beyond three miles may amount to no more than the claim of the contiguous fishery zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.513" offset="14933452">Beyond the territorial sea, very far from a claim of England water that is precisely what the United States did in 1966 back to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.443" offset="14989145">It claims a nine-mile zone within which it can exclude foreign fishing or regulate it or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.159" offset="15024044">And other nations throughout the world had the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.807" offset="15038568">Indeed, in the 1960 opinion of this Court in this case, the Court noted that for fishing among other purposes, nations had for hundreds of years created belts of jurisdiction of the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.677" offset="15118085">And the Court referred in that case to a tabulation which should have been made during the Senate Hearings in 1951 in reference to the Submerged Lands Act legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.101" offset="15171793">I have lodged with the clerk for the information of the Court, should the details be of interest three-year tabulations of claims made in the world community of fishing zones that exceed the territorial sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.517" offset="15249429">One is from the Senate Hearings to which the Court itself referred in 1960 opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.180" offset="15272103">One is from the 1960 addition of Shalowitz which has been referred to by the Court and the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.886" offset="15302928">And the last is the most recent state department of publication published in 1974 which incidentally shows that no less than 36 nations have fisher zones either excluding foreign fishing or conservationers which go well beyond the territorial sea and which obviously not intended to imply any claim to inland waters, indeed not even to territorial waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.907" offset="15419016">I conclude therefore that the fisheries regulation would indicate no claim to inland water here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.471" offset="15461230">And that's on the assumption that there's some real evidence about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.665" offset="15478053">The truth of the matter is that we have a series of acts of the legislature entirely inconsistent and contradictory some placing a three-mile belt within this bay everywhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.929" offset="15543045">Some on 18-foot long and all three fathom line which is always within landward of the three-mile belt in this bay to east.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.712" offset="15586200">And some of them, apparently claiming East Bay on what's called the point to point basis between the two levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.954" offset="15627160">The evidence as to the way in which the statutes was actually implemented is also most ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.642" offset="15661955">First, we know that no lease was ever granted more than three miles from shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.415" offset="15681076">As to fishing and shrimping, there is evidence that for broken periods, there was a patrol that ran from one ended the southwest jetties to the end of the south past jetties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.404" offset="15740949">But it's perfectly clear that that was not a consistent practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3916.364" offset="15768848">What it meant even when it was used is not clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.133" offset="15791940">At times, the 18-foot line or the three-mile line were used instead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3930.508" offset="15825377">So we have fall from a long continued consistent usage developed on the issue of enforcement, even assuming that such a policy would prove a claim to inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.909" offset="15890996">As to the exclusion of foreign fisherman, when you look at the depositions on which those allegations submit, you discover that most of them in fact live locally for all we know citizens in any event seemed to have been from that residence of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.859" offset="15958810">And the notion that their acquiescence in this fishing license regulations got back to China or Japan or Spain or the Philippines is most unreal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3981.099" offset="16027773">Anyway, they agreed to by the $5.00 fishing license or shrimping license and it turns out when one looks at the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3989.955" offset="16063195">The place they seem to wanted to fish most was Calhoun Reef which is very close to shore and whether they bought it three miles out of six miles act not that little to them the interesting ground for shrimping was Calhoun Reef.</text>

            <text syncTime="4100.569" offset="16505605">Now, perhaps I ought to turn to the claim base on mineral exploration that can be dealt with quite shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4110.340" offset="16544684">I've had nothing about it this morning but Louisiana's brief makes much of a lease granted in 1928 which can be construed as covering all of East Bay and all West Bay and a great deal more.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.622" offset="16609886">It is clear in the record that the only map accompanying or relevant to this lease which is in fact a release they did in 1937 shows that the oil company to whom the lease at that time been assigned found unusable and therefore release any portion of beyond the certain boundary and that boundary happens to be pretty much the three-mile limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4158.944" offset="16739140">Well, inside of it at places generally following it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4163.482" offset="16757321">It is therefore perfectly clear that there never was any exploration much less any production from any lease granted by the state in East Bay before 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.828" offset="16826702">And indeed when the case was last here, Louisiana dated its claim based on exploration from 1947, only in this proceeding has that been changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4194.597" offset="16881768">By 1947, of course President Truman had claimed for the country the entire continental shelf and other nations seeing operations more than three miles from shore would not have cared or known whether this was done under the provident, presidential proclamation or because Louisiana treated the waters as inland.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.229" offset="16992319">It's also relevant that as soon as that drilling began in 1947, the United States filed suit against Louisiana and has consistently challenged those operations indeed the Chapman line in East Bay which was meant to carryout this Court's decree in 1950 follows the three-mile -- follows the contour of the coast and in 1956, this Court was required to issue an injunction against Louisiana to prevent the drilling in the East Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.035" offset="17159502">It would be a very strange army if by acting -- if by prolonging this lawsuit for so long, Louisiana were to be able to establish on historic claim to inland water in East Bay by invoking the very activities which have always been in dispute since 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="4291.293" offset="17268590">Now on the historic claim, I think I need to say no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="4296.585" offset="17289697">It's clear that there are no unequivocal actions which indicate a claim to these waters as inland rather than as territorial or as contiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="4310.346" offset="17344763">There is no consistent pattern which could reasonably be called the usage and there is no indication whatever that any foreign nation was ever notified or ever had come to its notice any of these claims that Louisiana now asserts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4329.245" offset="17420309">In those circumstances, the absence of protest is meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="4338.448" offset="17457194">We therefore think, the mass are quite correctly rejected to Louisiana's historic claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="4345.010" offset="17483421">I turn now to the juridical claims advance by the state and first to East Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4356.585" offset="17529710">Now, we take what is characterize this is simplistic approach here and suggest that you look at this area without any lines on it and reach an impression and that's all these matters come to whether this qualifies as a well-marked indentation in closing landlocked waters.</text>

            <text syncTime="4575.802" offset="18406588">Louisiana makes an argument about that's not natural because it's an artificial jetty but I take that argument to have been foreclosed by the previous opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4585.906" offset="18447026">It's happens that once you test that full bay, under the semicircle rule it doesn't satisfy this Court so found in 1969.</text>

            <text syncTime="4613.698" offset="18558203">You can't go back that way, you've got to find that there is a geographic bay not one that mathematically satisfies the test.</text>

            <text syncTime="4627.834" offset="18614732">The Court said there may be a bay, a narrow one, a smaller bay within the East Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4634.264" offset="18640436">We're not saying there is, we're not saying there isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="4637.053" offset="18651617">The Master I think misunderstood or at least you seem to take the view that he must assume that there was a bay somewhere in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4648.483" offset="18697279">After all with all these bay, there must be a bay.</text>

            <text syncTime="4654.695" offset="18722147">I think he also assumed that any line which satisfied the semicircle test was at least presumptively good enough to make the juridical tests of the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4669.587" offset="18781706">Now ,it seems to us that that was going about it backwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4673.738" offset="18798320">He should've first said to himself, now if the whole thing doesn't qualify, is there in fact anything else that is a separately defined bay within this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4686.752" offset="18850356">And when you look at the two shores which have essentially straight, there's nothing that jumps at you as the natural entrance point of a smaller bay.</text>

            <text syncTime="6009.840" offset="24142764">On the contrary, it comes out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6012.230" offset="24152273">It's convex not concave.</text>
            <text syncTime="6014.982" offset="24163349">It's just an arbitrary starting point.</text>
            <text syncTime="6019.179" offset="24180067">It can't be seen as anything else so we submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6023.538" offset="24197517">Now the other point, on the face of it, it seems you have a little more to recommend it but it is really nothing more than the headland for coming that a bay is.</text>
            <text syncTime="6032.711" offset="24234193">It doesn't advert the mariner or anyone else that's there's a huge bay to the East.</text>
            <text syncTime="6038.359" offset="24256763">It tells you where you're about to go in to a bay coming out of bay of the other entrance of which is the island to the East.</text>
            <text syncTime="6049.549" offset="24301589">Actually not the island because this whole complex is one coming out of bay so this quite obviously a bay but when you get to here to realize that is huge bay to your right is not realistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="6070.368" offset="24384867">Now, the Master also said it was almost a perfect semicircle.</text>
            <text syncTime="6074.415" offset="24401063">It's that close but substantially incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6080.940" offset="24427081">If one draws a semicircle on either of these lines, one notices how much land has to be equal into before the semicircle of water is satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="6093.374" offset="24476818">The only reason the bay satisfies the semicircle test is because this Court held in 1969 that these waters can be thrown in.</text>
            <text syncTime="6103.631" offset="24517883">But in terms of perfect semicircles is all of this of land -- this all of this of land showing that the depth is not even but of a semicircle.</text>
            <text syncTime="6116.225" offset="24568247">Now, the statement that a semicircle is the classic form of a bay is a gross exaggeration.</text>
            <text syncTime="6123.845" offset="24598758">It is the minimum for a bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="6128.519" offset="24617462">The classic form of a bay is more like a sea shape with a pincer with something that tells you that you're now entering internal waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="6139.858" offset="24662810">Something which does lack the waters inside the closing line, there is nothing here which makes the waters on one side of the line more landlocked than the waters on the other side.</text>

            <text syncTime="6172.505" offset="24793422">When one puts those two phrases together, I think one expects to find the classical form at least would be a pincer, a semicircle will satisfy the test but this is not a semicircle because it does not even come in on the west as a semicircle would.</text>
            <text syncTime="6192.478" offset="24873253">Now when it compares Monterey Bay, which is a pincer one sees what a classical bay does indeed look like.</text>
            <text syncTime="6202.079" offset="24911705">There's no question whether the natural entrance points of Monterey Bay that two headlands facing each other and the waters behind the line connecting them quite clearly or landlocked waters one knows that one is within a bay and has left the open sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="6224.009" offset="24999372">What is more Monterey Bay is only 19 miles wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="6227.299" offset="25012537">This bay is 42 miles wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="6230.140" offset="25023927">We suggest that when a bay is over large, there's all the more reason to require stronger indications that each one has left the open sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="6241.876" offset="25070843">One can't see across this opening therefore, there ought to be stronger pincers to cut-off the ocean from the waters inside if one is going to reach the conclusion that this are truly inland bay waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="6267.816" offset="25174601">I have time for one word with respect to Caillou Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="6272.128" offset="25191842">The short answer there is that this Court has already resolved that issue in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="6279.526" offset="25221517">There are enough issues in this case without this Court's is being tempted to accept the invitation to reconsider that ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="6288.667" offset="25258088">What the Court said in 1969 was that neither did Louisiana claim nor was it affect that the either (Inaudible) were assimilable to the mainland as but that they were on the contrary islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="6307.036" offset="25331545">The Court's other holdings which were that Islands can never form the entrance to a bay and that you don't push out a line for the purpose of including islands unless it's a bay to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="6323.192" offset="25396120">And here, it's very clear no bay if you don't anchor it on the islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="6328.480" offset="25417331">This area would never qualify as a bay unless when you use this as a closing anchor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6337.548" offset="25453589">Now, here we have Caluboka (ph) about a third of a mile, about 14 to 15-foot depth and a marked channel, a clear separation from the mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="6352.763" offset="25514402">No serious debate that this is an extension of the mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="6361.233" offset="25548257">What's more as I say, the courts already resolve the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6366.141" offset="25567901">Louisiana says, all but the United States until 1968 conceded that these were inland waters which is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="6376.347" offset="25608756">The Court in 1969 said the Government is not bound by that concession because Louisiana has suffered no prejudice from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6386.189" offset="25648149">On the contrary, this is received revenues from oil exploration to which it may not have been entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="6396.070" offset="25687646">Louisiana says we were prejudiced because this area wasn't surveyed as carefully as it might have been if that had been an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6404.857" offset="25722755">But the years that have passed since 1968 and the present have offered ample opportunity to the state to make any -- to present a further reference if they were useful evidence present.</text>
            <text syncTime="6418.536" offset="25777507">They did not even reserve the right to do so when they stipulated the maps.</text>
            <text syncTime="6425.607" offset="25805824">In any event, they haven't done so and the new evidence doesn't change the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="6432.483" offset="25833305">It doesn't narrow the gap between the islands and the mainland relevant gap being Caluboka (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="6443.749" offset="25878340">In all the circumstances, it seems to us that the Master's gratuitous invitation to the Court naturally supported Louisiana to reconsider it's ruling with respect to Caillou Bay also be declined.</text>
            <text syncTime="6461.538" offset="25949497">Now, I have sought to say to the Court that this is not a technical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6472.235" offset="25992338">And that the Court ought to view it freely without being burdened with the suggestion that the record is overwhelming and that special expertise is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="6485.555" offset="26045628">I suggest the Master's Report be confirmed in all respects except its finding at East Bay, its finding at Ascension Bay and its finding with respect to posture Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="6605.744" offset="26526386">But I think before that they were recognized before they had the 24-mile closing line.</text>
            <text syncTime="6611.462" offset="26549269">They were recognized as historical bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="6614.334" offset="26560658">Now, as far as Long Island Sound is concerned, the United States through the State Department furnished information to Mr. Griswold to enter interrogatories in their Alaska case instead there were some question about whether Long Island Sound was a historic bay and later Mr. Meek wrote Mr. Griswold to correct those answers and said he had found out that there had been an agreement between New York and one of its adjacent states fixing a boundary in the bay which was approved by the United States and therefore they considered it a historical bay and said it was no question of any dispute about.</text>
            <text syncTime="6657.659" offset="26734007">That was the only thing he has said about.</text>
            <text syncTime="6659.956" offset="26743202">They didn't say anything about jurisdiction and physical dominion or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="6664.697" offset="26762115">It all automatically became historical bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="6667.596" offset="26773713">So, we feel that with the long history of action, the Louisiana's take along these bays, along its course and that there've been no -- even though the State -- United States says evidence is not all that clear but the Master found that they had enforce this laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="6688.482" offset="26857305">Now when they talk about the fishing, there's a reason case filed with this Court 54 original in which the United States filed a suit against Texas and Florida to enjoin Texas and Florida from enforcing each fishing laws more than three miles from the coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="6709.220" offset="26940270">This suit is pending now.</text>
            <text syncTime="6710.888" offset="26946957">In other words in and the United States recognize in that court -- in that case that they permitted foreign nationals to fish three miles beyond its coastline and if the states had no right to prohibit the foreigners from doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6727.281" offset="27012472">Now of course we recognize in 66, Congress passed an Act creating a 12-mile fishing zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="6734.132" offset="27039848">We recognize it had a convention on the sea of natural resources same time it had a conventional or territorial sea in Continuous Zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="6742.537" offset="27073494">But we are talking about in 1948 when Louisiana said its title was vested by the historical acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6749.800" offset="27102542">There was no permission to fish beyond the three-mile territorial sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="6755.072" offset="27123649">And it was in Louisiana enforce those rules within its bay that they were setting jurisdiction against foreign nationals beyond the territory sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="6764.756" offset="27162415">And certainly would be acts to establish historical waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="6768.960" offset="27179238">Now Mr. Claiborne didn't discuss the fact that these bays were recognized at one time as inland bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="6776.113" offset="27207868">As a matter of fact, the Special master in East Bay, he found that the line E that you saw on Mr. Claiborne's map and the line B that all of the requirements of Article VII of the Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="6793.108" offset="27275786">But he said that it did not meet the semicircle test when you use his rigid water measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="6800.892" offset="27306924">But the Master realized he was wrong so he found those lines and said to the court that you might take it more liberal few water bays and if you do these lines meet objectively those depths.</text>
            <text syncTime="6814.728" offset="27362304">And we say that under the Convention in the prior ruling of this Court, (Inaudible) case that the Court should take and include the waters of the streams that attribute to the bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="6830.004" offset="27423431">Now, this exhibit that the Government put which was (Inaudible) they entirely put the (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="6836.133" offset="27447881">It doesn't show all of the waters entering East Bay from South Pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="6843.312" offset="27476616">It doesn't show the waters in the bay from Southwest Pass or none of the Johnson buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6849.575" offset="27501693">Of course, all of that makes a difference when you look at that B to see if you can find headlands or you can consider water area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6858.682" offset="27538056">Now you have -- the maps that are in the record, even the maps that the Court attach to its opinion shows of all realistic view of East Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="6868.090" offset="27575777">Now Mr. Armstrong gave considerable attention to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6872.798" offset="27594585">He gave as all pertinent time and he worked and listened to all the evidence and on all of these points, these headland points, there was extensive evidence only.</text>
            <text syncTime="6884.003" offset="27639411">There was -- it located them with exploit testimony and we say that what the Government is attempting to do and Louisiana is not attempting to do, we are not trying to upset its finding in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="6897.031" offset="27691447">We say legally and he realized that was a legal question as whether or not he used the proper area bays and if you disagreed with him, he had fixed these lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="6907.345" offset="27732720">Now, he did the same in Caillou Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="6909.931" offset="27743065">He said that he realize that in the including of this Court in prior briefs there were some question of whether it was admitted that these islands were not assimilated to the mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="6922.221" offset="27792280">But he said that if from the evidence in this case was produced before him, then he would say that Caillou Bay was a juridical bay that it met all of the tests and the rigid tests that he set down with reference to the assimilation of these islands to the headland.</text>
            <text syncTime="6939.670" offset="27862079">Now, there's a difference between assimilating islands for headland purposes and islands in a bay to be considered water area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6949.789" offset="27902516">The fact that islands are in a bay might be assimilated to the mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="6954.591" offset="27921742">It doesn't make them nevertheless an island for the purpose of water bay because in a bay it's considered that that whole area is territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="6964.164" offset="27959986">In other words, there's no difference between the land and the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="6968.204" offset="27976182">Now, the simulation of an island for headland is a question there whether this island is assimilated to the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="6976.547" offset="28009514">Now, whether an island is an actual island in the bay, or whether you'd see that island is assimilated to the bay and then you could use it for water that's not the test.</text>

            <text syncTime="6994.884" offset="28082866">Now, we say Your Honors that we feel that Louisiana has adequately proved all of these waters of being historical waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="7008.344" offset="28136782">And I want to make it clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="7009.544" offset="28141589">We're not asking this Court to treat Louisiana's fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="7012.852" offset="28154755">All we want is what the facts of this case in the law would give us.</text>
