            <text syncTime="25.049" offset="203525">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.259" offset="216377">Petitioners removed these Mississippi criminal prosecutions from the state court to federal district court pursuant to the Civil Rights removal statute 28 U.S. Code, Section 1443 which dates back to 1866.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.716" offset="270190">The state filed an answer and a motion to remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.585" offset="281684">The District Court held an evidentiary hearing on the state's remand motion, granted the motion, and remanded these criminal prosecutions back to the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.605" offset="317837">On appeal by the petitioners, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed and a divided court by a vote of ten to five with a very strong dissent by Chief Judge John Brown, denied a re-hearing en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.708" offset="370186">The question to review is whether petitioners engaged in peaceful free speech activity designed to eliminate racial discrimination, may remove state criminal prosecutions against them, to Federal District Court pursuant to the civil rights removal statute to protect their peaceful exercise of rights secured by the Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which is contained in the federal code under the title federally protected activities, and as codified as 18 U.S. Code, Section 245 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="100.118" offset="503829">I think it's undisputed and the state doesn't dispute this in its brief that at the time of the arrests the petitioners were and had been engaged in free speech activity specifically protected against official interference by 18 U.S. Code, Section 245 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="116.961" offset="571225">The police officers knew this and this activity formed the basis for these arrests.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.376" offset="592854">The petitioners all were arrested on identical arrest affidavits warranted by the chief of police, which charged with unlawfully and feloniously to bring about a boycott of merchants and businesses, in there promote, encourage and enforce acts injurious to trade or commerce, under Mississippi Code Section 97-1-1.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.998" offset="691388">Now, although the testimony of the police chief, who was the only witness to testify for the state, does contain reports and complaints that he had received that there had been some interference with the merchants and the shoppers, there is evidence at all in the record that any of these petitioners themselves are guilty of any of this unlawful conduct, guilty of harassing or intimidating any shopper or merchant, and the state cites none in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.302" offset="804551">The petitioners were arrested solely and exclusively because of their peaceful free speech activity designed to protest and eliminate racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.357" offset="848750">As the petitioner John Ferguson testified and his testimony was not contradicted when he was booked, he heard, Police Chief Brown of Vicksburg comment, “anybody on the street with a picket sign would be arrested” and that's what happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="264.990" offset="1163368">The federal statute does give them an unqualified right to engage in a free speech and peaceful assembly to oppose the denial of the opportunity to participate in the enumerated benefits and activities under the statute, including private employment without discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.688" offset="1242154">So, the defendants under this statute had an unqualified right to engage in free speech activity opposing racial discrimination and employment and that was the purpose of the boycott.</text>

            <text syncTime="303.810" offset="1318640">And certainly, even are going behind the charges, the testimony of the police chief himself when he asked what were these petitioners doing prior to their arrest responded, they were stopping people and telling people not to stop in the shore -- in the stores that there was boycott on and the purpose of this boycott as the testimony reveals was to protest racial discrimination of employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="408.841" offset="1738689">That is one of the tests that the Court laid down.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.122" offset="1747884">However, we don't believe that this is a necessarily test.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.736" offset="1758333">In other words, if the petitioners in Rachel had been charged with trespass, in Rachel they succeeded and the Court sustained the removal, if the petitioners in Rachel had not been charged with trespass, but had been charged with aggravated burglary for example, or murder, or rape, the result should have been no different because the facts of that case clearly showed and they are alleged properly in the removal petition that the charges were based upon their refusal to leave the restaurant after they were asked to do so because of their race and that's the purpose of the evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.462" offset="1893230">Rachel requires an evidentiary hearing in the District Court to establish the facts and permit petitioners to prove the allegations of the petition, and once they've done that and shown that the arrests are based unprotected activity then I have the right of removal under Rachel.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.034" offset="1967522">The testimony as I've mentioned -- the testimony of Police Chief Marion Brown himself indicates that the basis of these arrests were the free speech activity of the petitioners protesting racial discrimination, and that of course is protected specifically by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.276" offset="2032515">Now, these mass arrests as the testimony, uncontradicted testimony indicates, brought a complete halt to any picketing in Vicksburg designed to protest to eliminate racial discrimination and that complete halt at any racial protest picketing in Vicksburg continues down to the present day and I think from these facts the conclusions can be drawn are clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.411" offset="2124988">These arrests were made in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.608" offset="2133765">It was solely for the purpose of harassing these petitioners in the peaceful exercise of their federally protected free-speech rights to protest racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.140" offset="2175979">And they were made under a state conspiracy statute which is extremely questionable, punishes any acts injurious to trade and commerce, punishes any acts injurious to public health, public morals, using vague terms and over broad terms which can be easily used to suppress free speech rights as was done in this case, and this was done to the great and immediate irreparable injury of the petitioners and persons similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.470" offset="2289246">Now, the purpose Congress in enacting this removal statute, and it goes back 1866, it was reenacted in 1870, reenacted in 1871, and Congress in 1964 took another look at the removal statute and provided an appeal to strengthen its provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.469" offset="2357269">Congress has over the past century intended to provide a federal forum in instances in which a conduct by state officials, violates equal civil rights of the petitioners and those rights are denied or cannot be enforced in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.697" offset="2430203">In enacting the civil rights removal statute, Congress carved-out a narrow but expresses an exception to the usual doctrine against the federal court interference with state criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.377" offset="2476910">Under 1443 removal of state criminal prosecutions of the Federal District Court, this is justified where petitioners can rely upon a right under law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens and Rachel construed this to mean and stated in specifically in terms of the racial equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.858" offset="2558830">So, we're not arguing that the Court include in this civil rights removal petition a broad spectrum of what we generally classify as civil rights or constitutional rights or civil liberties.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.679" offset="2606059">This is a very narrow statute, can be narrowly construed but covers this case because this statute undeniably and the Fifth Circuit held that Section 245 (b) clearly deals with equal civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.189" offset="2660080">This statute undeniably is a statute providing for equal civil rights stated in terms of racial equality and that's indicated by the legislative purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.378" offset="2704906">In our opinion, the Fifth Circuit completely ignored the legislative history and the legislative purpose of the statute because the committee reports and the quotations which we include in our brief indicate that the Congress intended to protect persons engaged in free speech activity protesting racial discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="774.749" offset="3202382">The initial charge was under 97-1-1, that is a conspiracy to restrain trade or commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.671" offset="3246059">That was the charge that was initially lodged and then later on appeal they change that, but it's clear to us that the notion of the restraining trade and commerce is sufficiently broad to cover the free speech activity which is protected by the federal statute because a civil rights boycott which we had in this case in which various merchants are accused of racial discrimination in their employment practices and persons are urged to not to shop in these stores, this can be considered by the state a restraint of trade or commerce, that is the costumers stay out of the store as part of the boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.412" offset="3404988">But even though it might be restraining trade or commerce under the state statute, it's protected by the -- by Section 245 (b) because it is free speech activity protesting racial discrimination in private employment and that's specifically covered by the statute -- by Section 245 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="848.381" offset="3496939">The other part of the removal section that we have to show, is that petitioners are denied or cannot enforce their rights -- their equal civil rights in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.490" offset="3545318">Now, the statute invoked is -- is very specific on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.273" offset="3560469">It prohibits whoever whether or not acting under color of law and this specifically refers to law enforcement officers by force or threat of force and this refers to any threatening conduct willfully injures, intimidates or interferes with or attempts to injure, intimidate or interfere with, the exercise of protected rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.758" offset="3650435">Now, of course if these mass arrests, based on the free speech activity of the petitioners, are not intimidation or interference, I don't know what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.889" offset="3698918">So from the very instigation of these arrests, the arrest affidavits were attested to by the city judge, these petitioners are denied and they cannot enforce in state courts their rights because the statute involved here, the federal equal civil rights statute provides a right as the statute did in Rachel, not even to prosecuted for the exercise of protected activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.442" offset="3809155">It prohibits any interference, any intimidation including arrests and prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.601" offset="3853772">The removal, we contend, is based, grows out of the Court's decision in 1966 in Georgia and Rachel.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.543" offset="3885537">Georgia and Rachel involved Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.708" offset="3906226">Title II is the statutory scheme which is very close and very closely resembles Section 245 (b) which we're invoking in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.313" offset="3944573">As I indicated, the Court held that you have to rely on a statute of federal law providing for equal civil rights stated in terms of racial equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.310" offset="3980622">The Court in Rachel held that Title II qualified because it prohibited racial discrimination in places of public accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.248" offset="4016358">Similarly, the statute invoked here, Section 245 (b) clearly qualifies of such a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.091" offset="4043734">It clearly deals with the equal civil rights as the Fifth Circuit itself acknowledged.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.054" offset="4063587">It prohibits forcible interference because of race with the enumerated activities mentioned and it clearly provides a right on the part of the petitioners to be free of any interference from official sources with their free speech activity protesting racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.949" offset="4131192">Now the Fifth Circuit held that Section 245 (b) as a criminal statute is not a law which provides for equal civil rights, but this holding is completely contrary to the purpose and intent of Congress in enacting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.452" offset="4205171">The legislative history indicates to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.877" offset="4214888">On August 15, 1967, Representative Madden at 113 Congressional Record 22670 said, referring to the statute, “the pending legislation will provide the means and weapons to effectively enforce the provisions set out guaranteeing all American citizens equal rights.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1364.480" offset="5561344">Well, there were two issues in the removal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.585" offset="5569703">The first was the factual issue whether the petitioner's activity was protected and the second one was that even if it was protected as a matter of law can Section 245 (b) provide a basis for removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.874" offset="5622888">Now, the Fifth Circuit only reached the legal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.264" offset="5632397">The Fifth Circuit only held as a matter of law that removal cannot be provided under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.999" offset="5655385">We believe that that was an error of law and is contrary to the intent of Congress as revealed by the quotes that we've indicated in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.422" offset="5685060">Now, the factual issue has yet to be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.892" offset="5698957">The two-judge court rule doesn't apply because the Fifth Circuit didn't review the facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1406.239" offset="5728319">First alternative is that this Court can take independent, make an independent examination of the record and determine the facts as in Cox versus Louisiana, or can reverse the Fifth Circuit on the issue of law and send it back and let them resolve the facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1530.062" offset="6223600">The Fifth Circuit seemed to take the view and we only suggest this to the Court, the Fifth Circuit seem to take the view that petitioner's activity was protected because it starts out its opinion by saying, no one questions the right of petitioners to engage in picketing and free speech activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.706" offset="6302177">So that implies to us that the Fifth Circuit believed that the petitioners' activity was protected and therefore was required to rule on the legal issue and we think that a fair reading of the record will support that contention.</text>

            <text syncTime="1598.979" offset="6499244">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.426" offset="6517112">I would first like to address myself some of the facts brought out by counsel opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.812" offset="6546578">While it's quite true that we admitted in our brief that that there was at one time or another activities which might border on free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.651" offset="6585971">That was not why these individuals were charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.251" offset="6600391">They were charged for other activities not for free speech at one time or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.039" offset="6631528">Next, it was brought out that they were charged initially under 97-1-1 of the Mississippi Code of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.512" offset="6665383">That is true, but while on remand by the District Court, and before the appeal was perfected, the grand jury of Warren County, Mississippi met in session on March 12, 1973 and charged these individuals under 97-3-83 and 97-23-85 which specifically addressed themselves to secondary boycott activities and threats or force in the use of affecting normal and lawful business activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.141" offset="6815953">This is clearly a case of interpretation of Rachel and Peacock, may it please the Court and in that sense it is interesting to note that the individuals rely on 18 U.S.C. 245 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.803" offset="6886588">In doing so, throughout their brief, they cannot cite a particular case either in the Circuit Courts of Appeal or in the District Court, which in and of themselves effect removal that is triggered under 1443 (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.966" offset="6963284">We think that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.568" offset="6969657">It cannot be analogized with 1443 (1) requirements because it is not a civil statute, it is a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.643" offset="7009991">It protects, it does not provide and in that protection it actually protects rights which have already been granted either by statutes of the United States or the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.935" offset="7067146">This is clearly brought out, may it please the Court in the congressional history of this particular statute, first by the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.785" offset="7106539">In the initial statement which we allude to in our brief by Congressman Cellar, he speaks of four objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.594" offset="7137782">First, that it protects individuals in the sense of force or interference in civil rights that is force itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.981" offset="7187310">Secondly, that it spells out those particular activities which would be protected in this -- by this criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.776" offset="7222523">Thirdly, it brings individuals who are participating in activities within the protection of the criminal nature of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.556" offset="7257631">And fifth and more importantly, twice in the statute, it spells out the penalties which are assessed, if it is found by a jury that an individual has been participating in these activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.579" offset="7321684">It's quite true as counsel opposite said that a jury must find, but we think that is in a criminal nature of itself and not in a civil nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.322" offset="7360658">The Senate in the Majority Report 791 specifically states that it is to protect individuals against acts of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.011" offset="7407365">There's no indication that this particular statute is for the ongoing of criminal processes of a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.032" offset="7439548">And of course individuals should be acting lawfully, which these individuals were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.337" offset="7464730">The language of the statute itself is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.111" offset="7479777">It is codified in the US Code as a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.450" offset="7493151">It begins in Section (a) by speaking that it does not in and of itself cut loose the state processes which might be charged under this particular statute, and that if no charges, no charges shall be brought under this statute by the Attorney General, by the Department of Justice without first the written permission of the Attorney General of the United States or its deputy and a conclusion that ,that particular charge is in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.466" offset="7641213">18 U.S.C. 245 is criminal, therefore, it does not meet the prerequisites of either Rachel or Peacock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.096" offset="7687711">Rachel has two prerequisites.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.562" offset="7697638">First, that the statute must provide for equal civil rights stated in terms of racial equality and secondly that it must proven and clearly predicted that that particular right will be denied or cannot be -- can be denied in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.257" offset="7780394">Like we said in the first instance, this is a criminal statute which provides protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.140" offset="7803904">It does not provide new rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.979" offset="7815293">245 (b) spells out specific instances, ten in fact which are protected by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.081" offset="7851656">Therefore, it does not come within the 1866 model as this Court projected in Rachel, in a decision by Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.648" offset="7893974">For in the 1866 model, it granted and therefore guaranteed new rights to citizens of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.173" offset="7944025">There has been some argument about whether or not this particular statute grants or removal protects the rights of one who is engaged in First Amendment or Fourteenth Amendment rights such as picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.146" offset="8004002">If this Court were to decide this, it would seem to be cutting back or reversing the dictates of Rachel and Peacock in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.685" offset="8042141">For in those two cases when read together, this Court decided in 1966 that the broad panoply of First Amendment rights and Fourteenth Amendment rights are not protected by removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.844" offset="8114761">As I mentioned previously, this appeal is now constituted of six individuals who are now under indictment by the Warren County grand jury in Warren County, Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.842" offset="8162722">They are charged with criminal conspiracy in effecting a secondary boycott and they are charged with use of force and intimidation to affect that in.</text>

            <text syncTime="2581.221" offset="10428270">First of all, the indictment is contained on 142 and 143.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.763" offset="10442376">There is the boiler plate language with force and arms but that's not part of the factual recitation in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.503" offset="10469334">The indictment simply charges them with promoting and encouraging an unlawful boycott, so as to prevent by black persons from trading or doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.713" offset="10502248">But the testimony of Police Chief Marion R. Brown indicates that his notion of preventing black people from doing business is telling them that there's a boycott on.</text>

            <text syncTime="2614.234" offset="10560345">He was actually participating in the boycott and in fact the beginning, he was very actively participating in it, that's the chief of police.</text>

            <text syncTime="2640.057" offset="10663581">Now, the state maintains that a criminal statute, a federal criminal statute providing for equal civil rights cannot be a statute providing for equal civil rights under 1443 because it's a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.441" offset="10713109">It doesn't compare with the 1866 model.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.281" offset="10728469">The 1866 model, the original removal petition statute was a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.331" offset="10756681">In Section 2, it provided criminal penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.419" offset="10769011">It was reenacted in 1870 as a removal statute and providing criminal penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.824" offset="10790640">The model 1866 was a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.865" offset="10802866">A criminal statute can provide for equal civil rights.</text>
