            <text syncTime="38.861" offset="258800">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.754" offset="274369">Mr. Gonzalez brought this action -- challenge against his creditor Mercantile National Bank, challenging the constitutionality of the repossession and resale provisions of the Illinois Commercial Code, and against the Title Officer to the State of Illinois the Secretary of State challenging the constitutionality of those provisions of the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code that authorize and compel the involuntary transfer and -- termination and transfer of her certificate of the title.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.998" offset="411355">A three-judge court was convened and subsequently dismissed the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.103" offset="435806">A direct appeal was then brought to this Court and this Court postponed the question of its jurisdiction pending this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.659" offset="469974">Mercantile has raised two objections to this Court’s jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.676" offset="490036">First, that a three-judge court was not properly convened under Section 2281 and second that a direct appeal does not lie pursuant to Section 1253.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.312" offset="544580">Because of the nature of the jurisdictional questions, a brief review of the underlying facts and a summary of the lower courts actual holding is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.885" offset="590869">Mr. Gonzalez had purchased a used automobile pursuant to a retail installment contract which was in turn assigned to Mercantile.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.114" offset="627858">When Mercantile repossessed the automobile they had received an amount in excess of what was then due and owing on the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.092" offset="667773">Although Mr. Gonzalez had not made one payment, Mercantile had received an insurance rebate which they were required to credit to Mr. Gonzalez.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.304" offset="712600">Mercantile however, credited the rebate to the final payments not to the current one and repossessed the automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.422" offset="761083">Upon consideration of these facts, the three-judge District Court found that Mr. Gonzalez was not in default at the time his automobile was repossessed and they thereupon dismissed the case for lack of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.094" offset="819702">They held that the challenged statute provide for repossession only in the event of default and since Mr. Gonzalez was not in default, Mercantile violated the statute rather than acting pursuant to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2306.234" offset="9328306">The Insurance Company cancelled the insurance on the 18th of April with respect to the two accidents one occurring on March and one occurring in April, and rebated $229.94 of the unearned premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.167" offset="9404061">The repairs were $542.68. Mercantile repossessed the repaired automobile on the 25th of April and paid the repairmen at that particular time, his repair bill of $542.00 so was required taking of possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.248" offset="9492355">Now, it is alleged in the complaint and since the case was disposed of on the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.878" offset="9510849">It is alleged on the complaint that Mr. Gonzalez was not in default at the time of the repossession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.811" offset="9546585">If you take the figures, it would appear that probably not so, that he was in fact in default but for the disposition of this case the case was taken on the plea and so it is presumed on the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.873" offset="9606875">There’ve been no proof taken on this case at whatsoever that at the time of the repossession Mr. Gonzalez was not on default so as a -- on the pleadings it was a wrongful taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.578" offset="9657657">So it was a breach of 503 and 504 because 503 and 504 permits self-help only if there is a default under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.419" offset="9725053">The Mercantile having repossessed under the Illinois statutes dealing with issuances of certificate of title which do not affect -- those certificates do not in fact affect actual title and the statute so provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.461" offset="9789210">The certificate of title is issued for the purpose of recording for keeping track of the car from a police standpoint and that sort of thing and driver’s license and that kind of made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.039" offset="9843545">It’s a ministerial act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.088" offset="9855770">A repossession license was issued under the Illinois statute here again not affecting actual title.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.480" offset="9889311">Now, notice of the sale of the automobile use repaired used car was given to Mr. Gonzalez by registered man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.937" offset="9931107">He did not act, took no action whatsoever and the automobile is then sold to a bona fide purchaser and that bona fide purchaser acquire actual title, as provided under the statute and also under the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.907" offset="9999026">That purchase in turn sold to a second party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.887" offset="10010937">Now, whether the automobile will be sold again, we don’t know but at least we know of those two sales that are all alleged in the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.534" offset="10041553">Now, after all this had occurred -- after all of this had occurred Mr. Gonzalez then intervene in a pending suit, the Mojica suit which is not involve here and for the first time on September 28, 1972 after all these months that time had passed he filed the intervening complaint which is a subject matter before Your Honors on this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.756" offset="10158373">So at that particular time, the title of the car could not be reclaimed in any form or fashion or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.601" offset="10189824">No relief sought the three-judge District Court unless we urge it, no relief whatsoever could be granted to Mr. Gonzalez at the time he filed his suit that would be of any possible benefit to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.079" offset="10251682">Now, to a dedicated and able young lawyer as Mr. Latturner is with the Legal Services Group in Uptown Chicago, it appeared to him that here was a case in which issue, broad issue of the constitutionality of the Uniform Commercial Code re. self-help repossession provisions could be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.012" offset="10339453">And so he filed the claim with that particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.293" offset="10356590">Now, the District Court three-judge dismissed this case because of mootness and lack of standing and that’s the first point Mr. Justice White.</text>
