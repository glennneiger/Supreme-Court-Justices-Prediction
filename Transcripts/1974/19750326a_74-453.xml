            <text syncTime="117.843" offset="574777">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.691" offset="586167">The central question presented on this appeal and writ or certiorari is whether New York is compelled to subsidized the shelter cost of an individual who is neither an applicant, nor a recipient to public assistance because he shares a dwelling with recipients of aid to families with dependent children with recipients of home relief, New York State and locally financed program.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.854" offset="678745">We will not consider today the proceedings below, except in passings, since they are set forth in detail in our main brief, and it is not contended by either the appellants or the appellees that there were any procedural bars to this Court's consideration of dependent Social Security Act claims raised on the petition for certiorari and wherein the appellants seek of judgment of affirmance, and/or to this Court's consideration of the constitutional claims raised on the direct appeal from the three-judge District Court in which the appellants seek a reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.426" offset="817089">Nor will we consider, except in passing, the subsidiary issues briefed in appellants' main brief at points 4, 5 and 6 and in appellee's brief on the merits at 4, 5 and 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.302" offset="868603">In New York, shelter is a separate component of assistance that every individual receives.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.872" offset="894830">The other component that the recipient receives is a per-person flat grant for food, clothing and incidentals.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.767" offset="930461">The amount paid for shelter or the shelter allowance is variable and depends on two factors: the actual rent on the dwelling in which the recipients live up to maximum established by number of rooms or number of recipients who in fact live there, and two; it is based on the percentage of recipients in relation to the total number of individuals who live in a particular dwelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.908" offset="1027009">The result of the computation of shelter allowances in light of these factors results in the finding that in New York, every recipient receives 100% of his per capita standard of need, or his individual shelter need determined in light of his actual participation or his share of the dwelling in which he lives and in relation to the actual or maximum allowed rent on that dwelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.240" offset="1148322">Under the system, no New York recipient can receive the entire cost of a dwelling unless he is in fact the exclusive occupant of that dwelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.250" offset="1188342">Since to do so, would be to attribute or transfer the needs of the other individuals who live there to the recipient.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.853" offset="1222823">Equally, no New York recipient receives a fixed or averaged allowance based on the shelter needs of a hypothetical recipient, such as are provided under flat grant systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.932" offset="1283114">To assure the court that in stating that New York needs 100% of the per capita standard of need of its recipients in terms of their shelter, and to assure you that we are not asking the realities by omitting consideration of the substance of the standard of need, we note that the maximums involved -- the maximums under which the -- the maximum which provide the sealing under which the shelter allowances are computed are provided by the 58 local services, social services districts which comprise the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.600" offset="1413726">That is intended by the state Department of Social Services as expressed directly in its pertinent regulation that the maximums be set at levels which provide shelter for recipients in conformity with local standards, and that the maximums are updated from time to time as appears on the face of them, in the appendix at pages 523 to 603.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.653" offset="1509961">And that the maximums themselves are subject to exceptions in favor of the recipients which are commonly made by local authorities to assure that shelter is in fact provided to the recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.011" offset="1563460">The point is demonstrated most clearly by the uncontested statement in the record below that approximately 93% of New York recipients received shelter allowances equal to their full cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.942" offset="1607137">Thus, the standard of shelter need is actual cost for the vast majority of New York recipients.</text>

          <turn speaker="judith_a_gordon" startTime="413.314" stopTime="926.911">
            <label>Ms. Judith A. Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="413.314" offset="1756662">That is wholly state and locally financed.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.061" offset="1779649">The question of whether New York must subsidize shelter cost of the non-recipient who shares a dwelling with the recipient of AFDC or home relief is presented in the specific context of appellee's challenge to Section 352.30 (d) of the social services Title of the New York Code of Rules and Regulations, and is limited to the portion of the regulation which prorates the actual of maximum allowed rent for a dwelling share between recipients and non-recipients when that recipient pays less than $15.00 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.604" offset="1921755">This non-recipient is called a non-contributing or nonpaying lodger under the terms of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.524" offset="1949445">The result of the proration under this portion of the regulation is the determination of the per capita cost for each individual who lives in the dwelling, and the payment of shelter allowances equal to the per capita shares or needs of the recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.636" offset="2025932">While no public subsidy is provided in the form of a shelter allowance or by other means for the needs of the nonpaying non-recipient lodger.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.093" offset="2067728">Sections 352.30 (d) contains an additional provision for contributing lodgers, who are defined again as non-recipients who share dwellings with recipients, but as individuals who pay $15.00 or more or $60.00 or more per month, depending on whether they are simply lodgers or boarding lodgers.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.739" offset="2150379">The contributing lodger's payment is income to the recipient and results in a pro tanto reduction of the total assistance benefits paid to the recipient, with the exception that the recipient is permitted to retain the first $15.00 or $60.00 pay as an income exemption or disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.330" offset="2228642">Notwithstanding, the permanent injunction contained in the judgment in order of the District Court against this contributing lodger portion of the regulation, the appellees did not place this provision in issue below and concede it to be valid in their brief before this Court, at pages 94 to 95.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.898" offset="2310980">As stated, the lodgers in both categories where the nonpaying or contributing are non-recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.072" offset="2339610">In addition, under the terms of the regulation, these non-recipients are individuals who do not owe the recipients with whom they live any duty of support, and concomitantly, the recipients and thus the state who is supporting the recipient owes the lodger no duty of support.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.058" offset="2415574">However, the lodger, like all other individuals, bears the primary responsibility for his own support, and this responsibility attaches to him regardless of whether he lives in a separate dwelling or whether he just shares a dwelling with recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.965" offset="2483284">It continues until such time as the lodger receives assistance, when that primary obligation is assumed by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.101" offset="2519751">In this sense, the lodger is in fact and is viewed under the terms of the regulations, as having the same obligation of self-support as all individuals in society who are not on assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.484" offset="2569279">It is this primary responsibility or legal obligation of the lodger that is recognized by the regulation and no other.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.382" offset="2624867">In light of the holding of the District Court -- of the three-judge District Court majority, to the effect that the nonpaying lodger provision presumes diminished shelter need when that might not in fact be the case, and appellees' repeated assertions that the regulation necessarily results in reduced shelter allowances, is appropriate to review briefly the two factual situations in which the nonpaying lodger provision operates, which show in effect that both these contentions are incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.250" offset="2760391">First, when an individual is added to a dwelling after recipient shelter needs were originally budgeted, under these circumstances, the preexisting per capita costs of the recipient shares must be reevaluated to reflect the fact that the shelter needs of an additional individual are being met, and that the actual or allowed rent is now allocable among the increased number of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.056" offset="2883584">Two results follow: a reduction in per capita shelter need and cost of the recipients, and a consequent reduction in shelter allowances.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.450" offset="2921200">Now, this result occurs regardless or whether the individual who is added to the dwelling is a non-recipient herein a lodger, or whether he is indeed a recipient individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.568" offset="2973654">As illustrated by the example -- by taking the example of the situation where we have for example a group, both AFDC recipients living in a dwelling, a point in time comes when a home relief recipient is added to that dwelling unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.619" offset="3033840">The result under the New York program is to reduce the per capita shelter cost of the AFDC recipient, and to pay the proportionate share now held by the home relief recipient from the home relief program.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.436" offset="3105102">Now, under the specific terms of the regulation in issue, when the individual that is added to the dwelling is a non-recipient and nonpaying, we recognize these facts in the regulation by not providing a subsidy for the non-recipient, and by recognizing as well that since that recipient is nonpaying, per force, a share of that shelter cost will remain unpaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.144" offset="3235924">The fact that the shelter cost, a share will remain unpaid does not mean that the preexisting shares were not in fact reduced when the lodger moved into the dwelling, since the lodger is in fact meeting his own needs by his additional beneficial use of the premises, nor does it mean that the lodger's, the recipient's shares can be increased if the lodger doesn't pay by transference of these -- the lodger's shelter needs to the recipient group.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.802" offset="3362565">The second situation in which the nonpaying lodger provision operates, but does not reduce allowances is shown by the facts since support of the appellee Taylor's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.419" offset="3405093">When AFDC recipient share dwelling with home relief recipients and one or the other recipient group looses its eligibility, and thus maybe become a nonpaying lodger under the terms of the regulation, the per capita cost of that individual is again not compensated.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.304" offset="3488580">However, since the number of individuals in the dwelling remained the same, the valuation of the preexisting shares also remains the same, and there is no reduction in the recipient's -- in the shelter allowances payable to the remaining recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.704" offset="3562141">Thus, when appellee Taylor and her minor child received AFDC and appellee's sister received home relief, the maximum allowed rent for the apartment was prorated two-thirds to AFDC and one-third to HR for appellee's sister.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.494" offset="3633298">When appellee's sister lost her home relief eligibility and became a nonpaying lodger, appellee and her minor child continued to receive exactly the same shelter allowance, two-thirds from the AFDC program and without any reduction obviously.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.625" offset="3713860">The nonpaying/non-recipient, appellee's sister, the valuation of the share of the nonpaying/non-recipient remained again, the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.412" offset="3765060">The only difference between the home relief and post home relief situation is that that share to with Virginia Taylor share was not being paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.805" offset="3806542">The fact that the share --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="926.911" offset="3811035">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.206" offset="3812185">It meant that the Taylor is the other and what about mother and son had to -- were stuck with the entire rent, although they were getting -- although the total group was getting one-third less shelter reliefs than before?</text>
            <text syncTime="942.135" offset="3871953">That's about it, isn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="judith_a_gordon" startTime="943.814" stopTime="1004.254">
            <label>Ms. Judith A. Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="943.814" offset="3878640">That's exactly the point I was coming to Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.935" offset="3887104">The fact that the lodger share remains unpaid does not, I believe and I think we can illustrate, result in eligible or drastic consequences for the remaining recipient.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.496" offset="3937364">Rather it places the recipient and the lodger herein plaintiff -- appellee Taylor and the sister in a situation where they may choose among several alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.092" offset="3975711">First, the lodger may pay his share of shelter cost or possibly somewhat less and obtain the benefits of the contributing lodger side of the regulation which we cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.328" offset="4012701">Second, if the lodger is truly needy, as it was claimed Virginia Taylor would, she or he may apply for assistance which is made available in New York to everyone and at 100% of the standard of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.209" offset="4076231">Now, in terms of applying for assistance, the individual obtains a grant or allowance measured to meet his own need, which of course include the shelter cost and the per-person flat grant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1036.709" offset="4250206">I don't think it would bear on the statutory question because the statutory question is limited in this case to the AFDC program and the consistency of this regulation with the AFDC program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.649" offset="4306004">I don't think it would be material to a determination of that consistency whether under other programs, other individuals could get aid, and we will come to a discussion of the relationship of the AFC statutes to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.384" offset="4356890">Now, in terms of constitutionality, while I believe that a regulation which had a uniform rational and fair operation would obviously be sustained under a due process or equal protection argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.800" offset="4422614">It might be an argument under that -- under either clause that since, there was no avail -- if in fact, there were no availability of the supplemental fact of assistance in New York that the operation might operate -- the regulation might operate so harshly as to be so arbitrary and capriciousness as to deny due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.719" offset="4510281">However, that is not in fact the case since we do apply, we do have the supplemental assistance program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.725" offset="4566288">Now, returning to the alternatives available to the recipient who lives with the nonpaying lodger; as I was noting, the individual -- the nonpaying lodger may obtain his own share of assistance, and thus provide the -- himself with his own means of support and generally, increase the maximum allowed rent available to the combined unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.949" offset="4663150">Now, this course of action was in fact followed by the former lodgers in the Otay claim and by Virginia Taylor, who I should not in response to your question Mr. Justice Stewart, is lost her original eligibility on home relief, apparently through her own fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.040" offset="4727515">The record shows that the status of the record on it is not extensive, but the record does show an affidavit of Morgan Rocklein from Nassau County that she failed to comply with continuing eligibility requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.732" offset="4782268">She thereafter, having lost her home relief, but assistance reapply but aid to the disabled has been since transfer to the SSI program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.129" offset="4819884">The third alternative is that the lodger may leave the dwelling, and thus remove the basis for the diminution of the recipient's allowances, if in fact his addition to the dwelling caused the diminution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.200" offset="4872129">Fourth, he may stay in the dwelling and hope to have the recipients meet his shelter needs from the balance of the assistance funds provided from themselves; namely, the per-person flat grants for food, clothing and incidentals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.671" offset="4926046">Now, Mrs. Delicio, an applicant for intervention below stated that this is the course of action that she would choose in order to hold her lodger in her home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.209" offset="4964185">However obviously, in view of the three other alternatives which we've just noted, this course of action is not the inevitable or even the intended result of the operation of the regulation, and it is doubtful that it could be long pursued consistently with the goal of the AFDC program and the state's responsibilities under it; namely, the protection of the children, or even as a practical matter, if the lodger in fact paid nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.651" offset="5069928">Now, we are compelled to note that appellee's position in this action does not alleviate the alleged harshness of this alternative to with the lodger staying in the house and eating and living of the flat grants provided for the recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.861" offset="5134817">As noted on the Delicio claim, the situation is brought about under the facts of these cases because it's claimed that the lodger is destitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.848" offset="5178807">However, on appellee's view which would eliminate proration of shelter allowances, for any -- under all circumstances where the, as appellees would characterize it, where the individual lodger refuses to apply his available resources to meet his own needs, and thus because he is the destitute lodger and the rich lodger as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.457" offset="5281207">Now, given that appellee state that the refusal to apply his available resources to meet his own needs, or the refusal to obtain such resources from the public assistance program, the result of the combination of those two factors is that the lodger who remains in the home on appellee's view still must obtain the balance of his support from the flat grants provided for the recipient individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.187" offset="5404087">Now as we've noted Section 352 functions essentially in two factual situations, both of which look at the lodger after the recipient shelter needs were first budgeted, and generally where the recipients were the first to tenants in the dwelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.376" offset="5468871">We've also noted that the computation of a shelter allowance under the New York program depends in part on the percentage of recipients who live in the dwelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.277" offset="5508472">Thus, we come to an additional regulation in the same Title of the State Code of Rules and Regulations, Section 352.3 (c) where, if the recipients move into a dwelling occupied by a lodger, they in their turn again receive prorated shares of the shelter cost of that dwelling up to an appropriate maximum to meet their own needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.750" offset="5602408">Thus, in factually similar circumstances, we have factually similar regulations, both of which are designed to meet the individual needs of the recipient wherein the individual needs of the recipient regardless of whether he lives with a lodger or if a lodger lives with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.499" offset="5677328">Indeed, proration is itself illustrated between recipients and recipients on the Taylor claim as we noted Mr. Justice Stewart when we pointed out that when Virginia was on the home relief program and the appellee and her child were on AFDC, there was in affect they proration as between those two programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.720" offset="5778265">Now, in subsidizing the shelter needs of the recipients and withholding a subsidy for the shelter needs of the nonpaying lodger, Section 352.30 (d) is a direct expression of the Social Security Act provisions providing for aid to families with dependent children, related states statutes and with implementing legislation in new -- under the -- with, pardon me -- and state statutes implementing the federal program, as well as state statutes governing the home relief program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.197" offset="5904175">We do not even reach in this case the traditional question presented on the statutory side of AFDC cases; namely, whether the challenged state regulation imposes an additional condition of eligibility inconsistent with the federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.691" offset="5978154">Indeed, the condition of eligibility required here qualified recipient status is the exact same condition imposed by the AFDC program itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.690" offset="6022144">Now, the federal legislation setting forth the AFDC program is set forth in some detail in our main brief at point one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.679" offset="6066134">In sum, that legislation defines the class of aided individuals for AFDC in a manner which excludes the nonpaying lodger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.286" offset="6104482">This is so principally because the lodger has not demonstrated his eligibility for assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.687" offset="6126111">In short, he is not paid because he is not a recipient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.009" offset="6143457">Appellees point that in addition and interestingly that the lodger could obtain assistance under the AFDC program, as he could obtain assistance under home relief, and this in fact true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.575" offset="6205628">He can obtain assistance as an essential person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.757" offset="6218376">Indeed, the facts Mrs. Delicio alleges would have made her lodger HN conceivably an essential person under AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.239" offset="6252335">They fail to know however that the major criterion for an essential person is of course that criterion which is applicable to all AFDC individuals; namely, demonstration of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.097" offset="6307715">Now, the federal and state statutes and regulations recognizes well, what is obviously commonsense and in fact true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.026" offset="6335509">That people who receive AFDC and indeed people who receive home relief, may well choose to live with non-recipients and then when that set of circumstances occurs, it is necessary in order to follow the mandate of the legislation to separate the needs of the non-recipients, or the person who does not come within the aided classes under the federal program from the needs of the recipient.</text>

            <text syncTime="1634.099" offset="6639783">As I was noting, the federal legislation notes that which obvious; namely, the dwellings maybe shared in common, and that when if that is in fact the case, it is necessary to separate one need from another in order to compensate only those needs of the recipient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.550" offset="6709582">Now, this matter is usually accomplished in New York, which as we noted at the outset treats shelter as a separate item of need, a matter again with HEW approval, and with reference to this record established by a document called Simplified Methods of Determining Needs, published in 1964, and indeed, these statutes and the regulations recognize and the program material recognized that shelter allowances maybe computed on an individualized basis such as the system in which New York effectively has adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.657" offset="6866004">Proration with the result of withholding the non-recipient share, is again expressly recognized by HEW, in that same 1964 document, and has been recognized with expressed reference to this regulation by the approval of the HEW Region 2 Commissioner, extended to this regulation specifically in the course of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.815" offset="6970598">Indeed, HEW's policy has continued then to date, and is shown in the most recent document we have available to us; namely, Guidelines for Development of Consolidated AFDC Standards wherein HEW provides some recommendations for states who wish to shift to a flat grant, noting that the affect of a flat grant system is to average away differences caused by proration between recipients and non-recipients, thus, stating in effect that for system -- for states who do not adopt the flat grant system, that proration of rental policy is still of course in effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1827.641" offset="7413948">In fact, I was just coming to the portion of my argument where I was about to state that the regulation here involved is not a man in a House rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.784" offset="7446549">This is apparent first by the terms in the regulation, and the facts in support of the Otay, Taylor and Olosi claims, which show that the lodger category is not confined to paramours but may include sons, sisters and male and female friends of various kinds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.654" offset="7506004">Second and more importantly, unlike King and Lewis, it does not depend, that is this regulation does not depend, on a fictitious obligation of support running from the lodger to the caretaker relative or to the children, to the extent either of their entire needs as in King or the extent of the lodgers' available resources as in Lewis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.975" offset="7599313">Rather, two obligations are considered by the regulation, or perhaps one is a lack of obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.214" offset="7620211">The lack of any legally imposed obligation on the part of the caretaker to support the lodger, and indeed, the obligation as we previously noted of the lodger to support himself; at least primarily and until such time as he comes to the state for assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.446" offset="7693145">In light of these facts, appellees' repeated use of the term “payment for the family expense” is a complete misnomer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.015" offset="7731388">The expense involved is that of the lodger, and his prorate of share is that share which is assigned to meet his own needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.782" offset="7770467">Now, turning briefly to the constitutional -- principal constitutional issue presented, we find that the nonpaying lodger provision does not depend on any irrebuttable presumption in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.112" offset="7827832">This claim must be viewed in light of the fact as we've noted that we are concern here with a system of individualized shelter needs which confronts the realities of the real world in terms of the recipient's needs in that world, that the regulations involved expressed directly or at least clearly complement the federal AFDC legislation involved, and indeed, the federal HEW program material, and -- which, if they do not mandate, certainly allow the exclusion of the lodger's needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.461" offset="7965236">And again, we are confronted with the situation where the federal regulations and statutes, if they do not mandate one particular system of determining shelter allowances, certainly allowed this system and possibly a system based on average demands as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.283" offset="8052485">Now, none of the federal legislation here, and indeed, the major state statutory provisions are challenged as unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.812" offset="8082578">In short, the underlying legislation which provides the basis on which this system operates is conceded by appellees to be constitutional; it doesn't violate the Due Process Clause at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.833" offset="8138689">We then come to their point where they say “but these regulations which either directly implement or complement the system violate the Due Process Clause.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.017" offset="8175470">Now, in terms of presumptions, we must add one further fact and that is this entire shelter allowance program, and indeed, regulation 352.30 (d) operates in the context where a hearing is in fact provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.772" offset="8238477">And that hearing is provided following at a recipient's request and following the investigation of the facts at every cert -- every case, in which a proposed reduction in the allowance is about to take place, and follows this Court's decision in Goldberg versus Kelly, and indeed, it is a pre-reduction hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2577.566" offset="10413641">Appellants are one because they only make one payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.945" offset="10423150">Now, it is true that in some circumstances, we make one payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.660" offset="10437987">For example, an AFDC caretaker and her minor children get one payment because she is the person of majority and they are all minors, anyway, put it so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.152" offset="10476022">Therefore, when we say in your example, the thirds, they each get a third.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.681" offset="10494098">Now, that third also reflects their beneficial used of the dwelling, right, in thirds.</text>

            <text syncTime="2940.521" offset="11865422">In 1968, this Court in King versus Smith held that the Social Security Act prohibited the State of Alabama from denying needy and dependent children of AFDC assistance because the caretaker relative associated where the person had no legal obligation to support the children and who in fact provided no support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.836" offset="11962702">This Court held that the Alabama substitute parent rule in effect defined the term “parent” in a manner that consisted with Section 606 (a) of the Social Security Act, and left Alabama's needy and dependent children without meaningful protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.759" offset="12038457">The New York lodger or the so called lodger, has the same relevant characteristics as Alabama substitute parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.493" offset="12081298">He is also a person who has no legal obligation to support the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.704" offset="12102196">He is also a person who has in fact provided no support.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.783" offset="12118497">Both the Alabama rule and the New York rule operate without regard to the family's actual needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.205" offset="12152142">The only difference between the substitute parent rule in King versus Smith, and the New York lodger rule, is that whereas Alabama completely denied AFDC children -- AFDC assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.703" offset="12218180">The New York rule works a reduction in the AFDC grant because the caretaker relative has chosen to allow another person to reside in the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.635" offset="12265932">We submit that this Court in King versus Smith did not imply, and we submit did not intend that needy and dependent children can be denied part of their AFDC assistance based upon the fiction that their needs have diminished because the caretaker relative associates with the person who has the same characteristics as the substitute parent in King versus Smith.</text>

            <text syncTime="3234.604" offset="13041768">Now, this regulation in essence provides that the inclusion in the AFDC family, where the presence in the home of any person other than a person who has a legal obligation to support the AFDC family is in the words of the regulation, not an acceptable basis for a finding of an eligibility, which would be basically a codification of the holding in King, the regulation goes on, or as, or for assuming the availability of income by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.888" offset="13190875">I submit that this regulation was designed to ensure that needy and dependent children are not denied and do not receive a reduced grant of assistance, solely because the caretaker relative has invited a person without a legal obligation of supporting to the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.585" offset="13265690">Indeed, this Court's decision in Lewis versus Martin makes it clear that the state cannot reduce the grant, even where the person residing in the home has some legal obligation of support, but way this legal obligation is something less than that of a natural parent, and secondly, even where the person residing in the home has available income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.608" offset="13361821">So, we submit that what New York is attempting to do here is to accomplish by the double assumption that (a) the so called lodger has available income, and (b), is applying the assumed available income to meet the family's needs, even though Lewis versus Martin in Section 233.90 will prohibit the states from even assuming that income which the lodger in fact has is available to meet the family's needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.356" offset="13492746">I think it is clear that the regulations in fact are based upon the assumption that the so called lodger is paying his share of the rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.990" offset="13539349">First of all, the lodger regulations themselves are on their face state that the available income and resources of the so called lodger shall be and applied in accordance with, and then comes a reference to proration in the grant and in addition, the lodger regulations on their face deem the person residing in the home to be a lodger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.363" offset="13640808">Now the term lodger, I submit connotes a person who is paying his part of the rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.970" offset="13671215">In addition, I think the operation of the regulation substantiate that they are based on the assumption that the lodger is paying his part of the rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.837" offset="13714683">The family's rental obligation is of course fixed initially by its agreement with the landlord, and the defendants themselves compute the family's shelter allowance in a manner that is designed to reflect and meet the shelter needs of the AFDC family unit, which in most cases would mean a shelter allowance efficient to meet its actual rental obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.942" offset="13827114">Now, these shelter needs and rental obligation do not automatically decrease of course by the fact that a caretaker relative has invited another person to reside in the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.616" offset="13873821">They would only decrease if the person invited into the home in fact pays part of the rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.062" offset="13903600">But I submit that it is this assumption of payment by the lodger, which is the very assumption of payment which is prohibited by this Court's decision in Lewis versus Martin and by Section 233.90.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.457" offset="13973191">In response to Mr. Justice Stewart's question, New York in fact, as one of its predecessor regulations to the present lodger regulation, had a regulation that queue conflicted with Lewis versus Martin, and it is set out in full in our brief at page 43, I will not take the time of the Court to read that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.840" offset="14062738">The reduction in the grant is not based upon any assessment by the state that the family shelter needs have decreased, and I think, this is brought out by the dialog between Mr. Justice Marshall and my adversary, and it's clear that if the lodger moved out of the home, the full shelter allowance would be restored.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.010" offset="14159391">In addition, if the family moved to a smaller apartment, no matter how small this new apartment was, no matter how low the rent was in the second apartment, the defendants would continue to provide a prorated share of the rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.131" offset="14227937">I think this is made clear by the factual situation of one of the applicants for intervention, Loretta Claque, that she lives with her five children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.913" offset="14270986">So, it's a family of six, and their rental expense and obligation is $75.00 per month, which is certainly I think a minimal amount for a family of six.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.397" offset="14316962">But because Mrs. Claque has invited another person to reside in the Claque household, the state continues to provide a reduced amount to meet their shelter needs.</text>

            <label>Mr. Martin A. Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="4485.324" offset="18044635">Well, I don't believe that the lodger would be a proper party in the neglect proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4491.532" offset="18069504">I don't think he has any interest in the issues relating to the welfare of the child, which are the proper subject of a determination between the state and the caretaker relative as determined by the family court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4506.273" offset="18128436">I do not believe that the lodger would be a party to that proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4510.235" offset="18144319">I misunderstood your prior question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4512.605" offset="18153827">The New York law is under Section 18 (b) of the judiciary law, and as established by the New York Court of Appeals decision in matter of Ella B there is a constitutional right to assign counsel that the mother has in the neglect proceeding, not the care -- not the lodger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4534.738" offset="18242330">Finally, our equal protection claim boils down to the fact that with the lodger regulations do is to create two classes of equally needy families.</text>
            <text syncTime="4547.793" offset="18294575">One class consists of the families in which the all persons in the home are recipients of public assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4554.584" offset="18321742">The second class of families consists of families in which the caretaker relative has invited a non-legally responsible person to reside in the home, and solely because the caretaker relative has invited the so called lodger into the home the second class of families receives a reduced shelter allowance and receives a shelter allowance which is insufficient to meet the actual shelter needs and rental obligation of the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="4583.789" offset="18438562">Now, we contend that the caretaker relatives' decision or choice to invite the lodger into the home is constitutionally protected by the related rights of privacy and association in the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.276" offset="18508466">These rights have been recognized by such decisions of this Court as Griswold versus Connecticut and Eisenstadt versus Bad, which create a zone of privacy in the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="4618.033" offset="18575548">The lodger regulations penalized the family that -- the family and the caretaker relative for exercising this right by reducing the allowance solely because the caretaker relative has invited another person to reside in the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="4636.058" offset="18647646">We submit that the state does not have a compelling interest to justify the infringements of the rights of privacy and association.</text>
            <text syncTime="4643.223" offset="18676276">It could reasonably accomplished its interest by making case-by-case determinations of whether the lodger has in fact made a contribution, whether the family in fact has excess space.</text>
