            <text syncTime="37.501" offset="253367">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.962" offset="267264">These cases are here on writs of certiorari to the District of Columbia Circuit, and they present a question which was left open by this Court in the Gissel Packing case in 395 US.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.187" offset="328077">In Gissel, the Court sustained the Board's authority to require an employer to recognize and bargain with a Union that based its claim to represent to the status on the possession of Union authorization cards where the employer had engaged in independent unfair labor practices that tended to preclude the holding of a fair election.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.594" offset="417729">The Court found it unnecessary to decide whether a bargaining order based on cards or some other showing of employee support other than a Board election is ever appropriate in cases where there's no interference with the election processes.</text>

            <text syncTime="97.531" offset="493484">There wasn't any occasion for the Court to address that question at all in Gissel, was there?</text>

            <text syncTime="112.292" offset="552521">But it was outside the scope of the case in controversy then presented to the Court, wasn't it?</text>

          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="117.257" stopTime="128.076">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="117.257" offset="572374">That is correct because, there, there were unfair labor practices which tended to preclude the holding of a fair election.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="128.076" offset="615633">And that was the fulcrum of the decision.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="129.967" stopTime="294.905">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="129.967" offset="623261">That was the fulcrum of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.247" offset="632351">However, we believe that the rationale in the Court's reasoning is relevant to the problem that we have here, as I will get to in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.791" offset="682506">There are two Board cases here which were consolidate for purposes of briefing an argument in the Court of Appeals on the Board's petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.504" offset="725347">The first involves the Linden Lumber Company which manufactures prefabricated homes and the second involves Wilder Manufacturing Company, a manufacturer of cooking utensils.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.645" offset="777906">The essential facts of both cases are similar and I'll briefly sketch them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.017" offset="803401">In both cases, the Union, the teamsters in Linden and the textile workers in Wilder, signed authorization cards from a majority of the company's employees in a unit later found to be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.830" offset="862647">There are 11 out of 11 plus the card of 1 employee who was found to be a supervisor in Linden, and 11 out of 18 in Wilder.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.499" offset="905383">The Union requested recognition, and in Linden, the company that request with a petition of the Board for a representation election.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.971" offset="939238">In both cases, the company denied the recognition request.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.642" offset="957942">In Linden, the company did so and refused to consent to an election on the Union's petition because of its belief that supervisors had assisted in the Union's organizational effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.172" offset="1008097">The card signers included Schaeffer and Marsh whom the company contended were supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.115" offset="1035786">The Board subsequently found that Marsh was not a supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.620" offset="1057834">That Schaeffer was, but that his conduct did not taint the Union's majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.930" offset="1087091">In Wilder, the company refused recognition because of its belief that the unit was larger than 18, which was ultimately found to be the appropriate unit and, thus, the Union did not have a majority in the larger unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.543" offset="1145501">And, before the Board, there was a contest as to whether seven technical employees whom the company claimed should have been included in the unit were in fact in the unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.839" offset="1182699">The Board resolved that against the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.073" offset="1199626">In Linden, the Union withdrew its representation petition and, in both cases, the employees struck and established picket lines in front of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.709" offset="1242258">In Linden, 8 of the 11 card signers participated in this activity, at least at the outset, and in Wilder, all of the 11 original card signers did.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.111" offset="1335777">Mr. Come, I think you took-- as I remember, when Gissel was here, the Board told us that its view now was that the employer, even in circumstances like these, was entitled itself to insist upon an election.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="324.479" offset="1401292">Yes, but the Board also took the position that the employer was no required to petition for an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.156" offset="1439953">That if the employer merely rejected the card showing with no comment, it would not-- he would not be guilty of a refusal to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.880" offset="1506931">That he could file a petition if he wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.410" offset="1521037">The Union, likewise, could file a petition because, in the Board's view, an election was the most reliable and the quickest way of resolving the situation.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="368.997" stopTime="372.563">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="368.997" offset="1579342">And what's the difference of these situations?</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="372.563" offset="1593657">There is no-- the difference here is whether or not, at least as I understand the difference between the parties, the fact that the employer had knowledge independent of the cards that was provided by the picket line showing should be enough to make a difference in the bargaining obligation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="403.022" stopTime="407.747">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="403.022" offset="1715493">You mean the picketing is sort of a demonstrative election, is that the idea?</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="412.205" offset="1752168">Now, has that always been the Board's position?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="415.899" stopTime="498.427">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="415.899" offset="1767006">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.614" offset="1769827">That has not always been the Board's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.845" offset="1778709">As-- when we were here before in Gissel, we pointed out to the Court that the Board's position under the Wagner Act was the Joy-Silk position, and that was also the position during the early days of Taft-Hartley.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.885" offset="1854882">Joy-Silk position made good faith doubt the touch stone at the bargaining obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.364" offset="1888841">In other words, the Union came forward with a card showing or a card showing plus a picket line showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.733" offset="1930324">The burden was on the employer, if he rejected a bargaining request, to come forward with reasons to show why he doubted the Union's majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.562" offset="1997615">The Board, over the years, had great difficulty in applying the good faith doubt concept because it involved, in many cases, a probe into the employer's objective motivation.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="498.427" stopTime="510.874">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="498.427" offset="2097089">So that's when the Board went to the idea that if they wanted to refuse the cards and insist on an election, whether they file their own petition or not, they could do so without committing an unfair labor practice.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="510.874" stopTime="511.605">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>

            <text syncTime="511.605" offset="2149752">Now, when this change is now-- you are now presenting it.</text>

          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="519.126" stopTime="721.873">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="519.126" offset="2179845">Now, at the time of Gissel, we pointed out that the Board had abandoned the Joy-Silk Doctrine and had virtually ended up as the Court said in Gissel.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.098" offset="2255809">Under the Board's current practice, an employer's good faith doubt is largely irrelevant and the key is the commission of unserious unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.117" offset="2295829">Thus, an employer can insist on an election with no comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.973" offset="2319235">The Court added, however, that the Board had a qualification that-- of the independent knowledge that if the employer knew through a personal poll, for instance, a majority of his employees supported the Union, that would make a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.979" offset="2447339">Now, what has happened here is that the Board, subsequent to Gissel, has concluded that the independent knowledge exception is subject to the same problems in it that led to the abandonment of the good faith doubt principle to begin with because, how are you to know whether the employer has an independent knowledge?</text>
            <text syncTime="623.675" offset="2598118">As the Board put it, that would require us to reenter the picket of good faith doubt that we told the Court that we had abandoned in Gissel.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.156" offset="2640018">The Union says, however, a picket line showing is something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.877" offset="2670843">The Board concluded and the Court of Appeals agreed with the Board that a picket line showing should not be entitled to definitive weight because a picket line showing is very often the result of a bandwagon psychology.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.424" offset="2777109">There may be peer pressures that would induce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.370" offset="2800828">And, to find out whether the employees really meant it or didn't mean it, you're going to have to probe subjective motivation and, therefore, the cleanest thing is to adopt the clear-cut principle that if an employer keeps his hands clean and does not commit unfair labor practices which would interfere with the holding of a fair election, he's entitled to reject a showing less than a Board election.</text>

            <text syncTime="1355.250" offset="5524355">They also believe that if the employer petitions, he-- it's going to be faster because there's-- it's much-- there's much less likelihood of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.966" offset="5607215">Now, we submit that that is not entirely valid because even if the employer were to petition, unless he were willing to consent to a hearing, that would not speed things up any because an employer petition would not preclude the employer from litigating unit questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.575" offset="5713690">For example, in the Wilder case, there was a question of whether the seven technicals were included in the unit or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.909" offset="5775026">Now, even if the employer were forced to file a petition, it is most unlikely that he would've waived his right to go to a hearing on that question because that could well make a difference in the Union's majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.409" offset="5845034">Similarly, in Linden, there was a question of supervisory assistance in the Union's organizational drive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.308" offset="5900622">An employer petition would not have cut out litigation of that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.844" offset="5922774">So, we submit that the assumption of the Court of Appeals that an employer petition would invariably speed things up would not, we submit, preclude an employer who had either a legitimate or either-- or an illegitimate basis for seeking to litigate issues still continuing to litigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.116" offset="6035832">So, with that in mind, the Board has concluded there's no warrant for distorting the scheme of the statute and then requiring an employer petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1607.868" offset="6534875">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.103" offset="6547832">We agree with the Labor Board that where an employer does not commit unfair labor practices and preclude a fair election, a bargaining order based on either cards or picket lines or both or other secondary indicia of employer's-- employee support should not issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.100" offset="6611780">At the heart of this issue, as the Court of Appeals noted, is really a fundamental disagreement as to the direction and policy of our National Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.935" offset="6643127">Let me try and summarize what I believe the Union's position is this-- is thusly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.310" offset="6660577">The Unions argued not only the cards or picket lines should be an interchangeable substitute with elections, that actually they should be preferred to elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.588" offset="6701746">The Unions argue that the policy of our Labor Act at the time of the Wagner Act has remained unchanged, that it is to promote unionization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.256" offset="6732361">That elections, since they take longer, since Unions loose more elections than they do in a case of obtaining cards, should not be used unless there is a bonafide dispute as to whether the cards or the picket lines evidence employee support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.446" offset="6789204">Where there is a bonafide dispute, then there should be an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.642" offset="6801951">Where there is no bonafide dispute, then the cards or the secondary indicia should speak for themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.739" offset="6826297">We disagree with this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.211" offset="6832253">We think it's contrary to the intent of the Taft-Hartley amendments to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.145" offset="6847927">We think it's contrary to this Court's reasoning and the logic of its opinion in the Gissel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.571" offset="6873631">At least since 1947, the Board has never, and I emphasize “never,” held that cards or sec-- or picket line activity, in it of itself where there's no unfair labor practices, is the basis for a bargaining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.786" offset="6934549">Since the Taft-Hartley amendments were added to the Act, the policy of the Act has been not to promote unionization but to promote three reasoned, informed employee choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.155" offset="6980002">That was the entire thrust of the Taft-Hartley amendments to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.324" offset="6996720">An election, as we thought this Court made clear in Gissel, is the preferred means, not other means, and other means are only to be used where, in the language of the Franks Brothers case, to prevent an employer from profiting by his own wrong doing or where an election is not possible because an employer is precluded by his unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.166" offset="7079999">Where an election is possible, where a free election is possible, then that ought to be the Courts that's used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.943" offset="7107166">There are many indications, we think, of this congressional intent and this change in the direction of the Act at the time of Taft-Hartley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.854" offset="7138826">First of all, and the real thrust of the law which now, as this Court stated last term in the Savair case, is one of neutrality to our collective bargaining, not promotion of collective bargaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="1767.538" offset="7173517">I gather, Mr. Cohen, this argument suggest that Joy-Silk were wrongly decided by the Board.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence M. Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="1771.784" offset="7190549">No, I think that Joy-- the question really is, in Joy-Silk there were unfair labor practices, the question that's really before the Court is a gloss on the Joy-Silk Doctrine in a sense of whether where there are no unfair labor practices standing alone, the so-called Snow &amp; Sons independent knowledge question, if in Joy-Silk there were unfair labor practices and the Board, at all times after 1947 with the exception of the renege type situation that Mr.-- which was actually Snow &amp; Sons that Mr. Come alluded to, except for that kind of renege exception, the Board uniformly did ever issue bargaining orders where there was no unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.105" offset="7339760">That was Secretary of Labor Wirtz's position when he testified during the amendments to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.138" offset="7359927">That was the position that the Board expressly stated in 1966 in the Aaron Brothers case that this Court referred to in Gissel and has been, in as far as we've been able to research in any other commentator, the uniform position of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.936" offset="7411127">One commentator, as cited in our brief, said that no Board member has even suggested going as far as the Unions would propose at any time since 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.098" offset="7443728">So, in our opinion, there's no change in direction of the Board policy in this case, merely a reaffirmation of what it has been long-standing Board policy required by the congressional intent manifested in Taft-Hartley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.890" offset="7490957">Taft-Hartley added, for example, Section 9 (c) (1) (b) to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.808" offset="7506631">This provision, as this Court stated in Gissel, fully supports the Board's present administration of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.329" offset="7532648">Before an employer can insist on a secret ballot election unless, in the words of the Board, he engages in contemporaneous unfair labor practices, likely destroy the Union's majority and impede the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.750" offset="7578415">So, 9 (c) (1) (b) does not, as the Unions argue here, detract from the Board's policy nor, as the Court of Appeals argues, should it impose an independent requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.168" offset="7624077">It supports the Board's policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.835" offset="7630764">The employer has an option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.408" offset="7637034">He can let the Union file a petition and do nothing or he can, if he wishes, go in and file his own petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.092" offset="7663783">There was an addition in Taft-Hartley, Section 8 (c), added to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.935" offset="7679143">It is-- the purpose of Section 8 (c), we submit, is to permit an employer to articulate his views on the reasons why employees should not choose Unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.457" offset="7713207">It wish to inform employees and permit them to consider the question in a light of an election with the knowledge of both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.488" offset="7741315">There is also the expressed writing added in Taft-Hartley that employees can-- may refrain from unionization, that the Unions cannot interfere with that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.826" offset="7778722">Taft-Hartley, as well as the Landrum-Griffin amendments to the Act, curtailed recognition picketing, secondary boycotts, use of Union power to try and obtain recognition and there was also the requirement added that certification could only issue in the purpose-- in the case of an election and decertification and so on as we've spelled out in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.937" offset="7851133">The thrust of all these changes was not to promote and cur-- continue to promote unionization but to, instead, direct the Act at employee free choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.347" offset="7884779">It was to channel claims for recognition into the election area unless there was either voluntary recognition or unless the employer preclude the use of election machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.758" offset="7930441">Since ha-- Taft-Hartley, as I've indicated, the Board has repeatedly recognized this principle.</text>

            <text syncTime="2040.727" offset="8266271">Contrary to Mr. Come, we would take the position that the Board has no power even if it wanted to, which it has not, to require an employer to file an election petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.603" offset="8309739">That would impose an obligation no required by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.732" offset="8326248">9 (c) (1) (b) permits but does not require an employer election petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.253" offset="8348400">In fact, that idea was suggested at the time of the Taft-Hartley amendments and rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.414" offset="8368985">To quote a couple of sentences from a Fourth Circuit decision in Logan Packing, “it was made plain of the Taft-Hartley Committee reports that an employer, after receipt of a demand to bargain from a Union claiming to represent a majority of employees, need not petition for an election.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.487" offset="8433351">He had the alternative of waiting for the Union to invoke the Board's election process, but he was assured of an election at his own petition if the Union sought to obtain recognition by a means other than an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.213" offset="8476191">The second defect in the Court of Appeals' position, as Mr. Come has pointed out, is that it resurrects the good faith doubt test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.353" offset="8504822">“When should an employer have to petition?</text>

            <text syncTime="2180.749" offset="8826337">I mean, I don't think the Act requires either party to petition for an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.080" offset="8843682">I think that's demonstrated by the 8 (b) (7) Section that Mr. Come alluded to, 8 (b) (7) presu-- permits recognition picketing to go on unless either party files a petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.523" offset="8889448">Now, if the Court of Appeals is right that the employer has to file a petition, that option is lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.473" offset="8905226">The employer can't simply sit back, let the Union engage in recognition picketing, and do nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.927" offset="8923094">He's required to go in and file a petition which automatically removes the time bar, the 30-day period, in Section 8 (b) (7) (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.001" offset="8951411">It's inconsistent to say, on one hand, employers can sit back and let the Union picket for 30 days and then it's over if a petition hasn't been filed and, second hand, say the employer must go in and file a petition which, in effect, removes the 30-day time bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.026" offset="9011493">To answer Mr. Justice Blackmun's question, why do Unions want employers, let's say, to file a petition?</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.335" offset="9036675">Well, first of all, it removes the 30% interest showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.526" offset="9049527">Unions can-- if an employer files a petition, the Union doesn't have to have any interest showing and the result is that, at that point, election is held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.406" offset="9080978">The Union could win the election without ever having established the 30% requirement that it would have to do if it filed its own petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.855" offset="9110758">It enables, secondly, a Union to control the timing and the duration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.917" offset="9127058">Unions frequently demand recognition and proposed with-- at the peak of their organizational campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.063" offset="9151613">So that, if an employer is required to file as soon as a Union demands recognition, there's no time hiatus between the filing of the petition and the Union's demand for recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.132" offset="9187871">Now, the-- and, any alter-- any possibility that the employer, during that period, can engage in campaigning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.344" offset="9212740">Unions traditionally want to speed up the election process because, as soon after they have organized as possible, they would like the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.724" offset="9242311">Employers traditionally take the opposite point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.989" offset="9251297">The more time that elapses, the more opportunity employees have to hear the other side, the better the chance of employer's success and the better-- the less chance the Unions are going to win the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.285" offset="9296541">So, the thrust of the Court of Appeals' argument is that this supposedly would avoid delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.658" offset="9317961">Well, it doesn't do so because of the Union file-- if the employer files a petition, the Union can say “we don't want that unit,” and the Board will then dismiss the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.461" offset="9353174">The Unions may still say “well, we're willing to take that unit, but we have some disagreement over the composition of the voting unit.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.355" offset="9376789">Again, what would happen in that case is there's a hearing required, and the hearing would be the same kind of hearing with the same Boar processes as would take place in the case of an employer petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.257" offset="9424436">So, the problem with an employer required petition is, first, it's not required by the Act, it's contrary to the committee reports, it doesn't avoid delay, and it's unfair to employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.408" offset="9469053">And, for all these reasons, we get back to the basic principle which we have argued to this Court that, unless there are unfair labor practices, one should look to the primary function of an election which is the whole thrust of the Act to resolve the question “do employees want or don't want a Union?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.706" offset="9530180">And, looking to that primary thrust, it's only when the employers precluded it that the Union should not have to test its claim in the crucible of an election.</text>

            <text syncTime="2591.917" offset="10471006">I'd like to pursue the inquiry that it seemed to me that Mr. Justice White open with his question, and that inquiry is, what are specific statutory materials that are relevant here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.311" offset="10528580">It's our view that, in accord with normal practice, we should start with the language of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.642" offset="10561912">The language set out, among other places, in page 2 of our brief and what the language does is make it an unfair labor practice for an employer “to refuse to bargain collectively with the representative designated or selected by the majority of the employees in an appropriate unit.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.958" offset="10667238">The only open-ended words there are “designated” and “or selected,” and it's perfectly plain that those words are not the equivalent of “certified.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.035" offset="10711542">And yet, the Board in our view, has, in effect, changed those words even though Congress refused to do so in 1947 to make them read “certified.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.779" offset="10758457">We think that this language says, and says quite clearly on its face, that if the Union secures the status of majority representative which it secures by being designated or selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.052" offset="10811538">The employer has an obligation at that point, a duty, to recognize.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.176" offset="10844035">The Board says “no, he has a privilege, a privilege to require the Union to petition for and secure a certification.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.388" offset="10888965">That privilege is subject to certain conditions subsequent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.588" offset="10913729">It can be lost if the employer commits unfair labor practices or it can be lost if he voluntarily agrees to some test of the Union's majority, but it is a privilege nonetheless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.672" offset="10970049">It is an absolute privilege subject to those conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2742.944" offset="11075166">Let me digress to try to reach the point of what was the Court of Appeals' judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.508" offset="11097422">The Court of Appeals opinion on page 35 of the NLRB's petition, there are two petitions here, states the Board's view of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.919" offset="11167013">It says the Board has adopted a voluntarous view of the duty to bargain which is that, absent unfair labor practices or an agreement to determine majority status through means other than an election such as a poll, the employer has no duty to recognize the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.121" offset="11247888">That's the Board's absolute privilege position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.122" offset="11259904">Then, on pages 36 through 37, the Court of Appeals says “we reject that absolute privilege position because it is contrary to the statute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.712" offset="11310268">The paragraph on the bottom of page 37 says “these statutory provisions plainly contemplate employer duty of recognition even in the absence of election and give a safeguard to the employer who has doubts about majority status by assuring him the right to file his own petition for an election.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.932" offset="11391143">There is no clear-cut answer, however, either in the text of the statute or the legislative history to the question of when and in what circumstances an employer must take evidence of majority support as convincing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.737" offset="11446314">So, there are two questions, one, is the Board right in saying that an employer never has a duty to bargain with the Union, that he has an absolute privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.348" offset="11484766">The Court of Appeals answered that question, “no.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.293" offset="11496573">The next logical question is under what circumstances does the employer have a duty?</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.763" offset="11522382">The Court of Appeals did not answer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.325" offset="11532622">It did not enter a bargaining order here and, from pages 38 through 50 of the petition appendix, it discussed the question of possible rules that the Board could adopt as long as it recognized the one limitation very clear on the statute, that it couldn't require the Union to petition for certification in every case no matter what its showing had been.</text>

            <text syncTime="2975.280" offset="12004498">We thought it best to deal with the Board's flat position, never, at this point, and leave it to the Board to deal with that which it can deal with because it is our view that this question which is here is when that the statute answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.234" offset="12072312">But, it is our view that there are options opened to the Board in answering the secondary question when hav-- when, if ever-- I mean, when does the employer have the duty to recognize the exact circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.490" offset="12133334">In other words, there are a variety, even though it isn't clearly acknowledged here, there are a variety of ways the Union can prove its majority.</text>

            <text syncTime="3019.172" offset="12180041">Another would be, as in this case, through cards plus a strike by the card signers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3229.301" offset="13020557">That's been the law and, from 1935 until 1947, it must have come forth, rightly stated, it was perfectly well settled that the employer had an obligation to bargain with the Union when the Union presented convincing evidence of majority support that he could not insist that the Union petition for an election and, indeed, it was perfectly well-settled prior 1935 that he had no right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.997" offset="13127346">The employer had no right under any circumstances to petition for an election when there was only one Union in the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.254" offset="13156394">That was the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.195" offset="13164126">Now, to get back to the language of the statute, the language of the statute imposes a duty on the employer to bargain with a Union which has the status of having been designated or selected by the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.963" offset="13235179">Congress did not, in 1935, use the word that the employer only had a duty to bargain with a Union which had been certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.602" offset="13277811">Now, let me talk about the precedence from 1935 to 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.824" offset="13306650">Early on in the Act, Judge Leonard Hand, in the Remington Rand case which is cited on pages 9 and 10 of our brief, said that the employer was not completely at the mercy of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.017" offset="13387421">The Union could not come in and say “we represent a majority.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.610" offset="13401840">The employer would say “show me some evidence of that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.703" offset="13418141">The Union would say “we don't choose to show you any evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.489" offset="13433292">In fact, we represent a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.988" offset="13443323">We don't choose to show you any evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.563" offset="13449592">We're going to file an 8 (a) (5) charge against you and prove it at the hearing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.047" offset="13467564">Judge Hand said that it's permissible to look at the statute as requiring the Union to come up with some evidence and, on the other hand, if he does not, the employer could say that he has a good faith doubt since the Union hasn't shown him anything to back up its claim and, on the other hand, Judge Hand made it perfectly clear that the employer-- that because of this option for the employer, it does not mean that the employer, no matter what the facts are, can say he only thing we will accept is a certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.255" offset="13632345">He says “it does not follow from that immunity, the immunity based on good faith, it does not follow from that immunity that the employer need be satisfied with no evidence except the Board's certificate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.749" offset="13694412">Later on in Dahlstrom Metallic Door which is cited in pages 6 and 7 of our brief, a case in which there were no employer unfair labor practices, Judge Charles Clark, also Second Circuit, said the contention that bargaining was not mandatory until the Board had accredited local 307 as bargaining agent is frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.760" offset="13794408">An employer is under a duty to bargain as soon as the Union representative presents convincing evidence of majority support.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.543" offset="13833592">We've cited other Board cases as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.810" offset="13854595">We-- I don't how law could be more clearly settled that an employer does not have-- that, prior to 1935, an employer did not have-- prior to 1947, an employer did not have the option to say to a Union, “no matter what evidence you show me, the only thing that will satisfy me is a certificate,” or in practical terms say the same thing by saying “I will not bargain with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.675" offset="13962115">You can go to the Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.975" offset="13967235">You can do whatever you want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.609" offset="13973817">I am not going to bargain with you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.373" offset="13980818">I think that that was a thoroughly discredited view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.047" offset="13995551">I know of not a single case, prior to 1947, which can be cited to support the proposition that an employer had such an option.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.419" offset="14041004">And, yet, that is what the Board would give to an employer today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.778" offset="14058454">Then, in 1947, the Taft-Hartley amendments were passed and Congress specifically addressed itself to the question of whether Section 8 (a) (5) and 9 (a) should remain as they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.646" offset="14117909">The House which, by in large, took the position which was less favorable to Unions and more favorable to employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.786" offset="14158555">Then, the Senate passed a Bill which said that an employer who had failed to bargain with a Union currently recognized by the employer or certified as such through an election under Section 9 was the only one who was guilty of a Section 8 (a) (5).</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.669" offset="14238072">The practical effect of that would've been to repeal the law as it had been understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.092" offset="14275688">The Senate would not accept that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.345" offset="14296795">The Senate insisted that Section 8 (a) (5) and 9 (a) stay as they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.835" offset="14322709">The only change was that Section 8, what had previously been Section 8 (5), became Section 8 (a) (5) because of the addition of the 8 (b) Sections creating Union unfair labor practices.</text>

            <text syncTime="3569.232" offset="14380283">The proposed amendment is reproduced on page 15 of our brief, the rust-colored brief, and the House proposed to amend Section 8 (a) (5) and 9 (a) which, as I've indicated, together impose a duty to represent the-- I mean, to recognize the representative designated or selected with an obligation imposed on employers to fail to bargain with a Union currently recognized by that employer or certified as such through an election under Section 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.888" offset="14538898">So, the employer would've been free of the duty as it had been understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.013" offset="14555408">His only duty would be to recognize a Union that had been certified or one that it had already recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.029" offset="14599502">In the conference agreement-- I mean, in the House conference report, and this is a House conference report I'm talking about now which, again, is reproduced on page 15 and I emphasize the word “House conference report” because the printed document which came out of conferences at that time was prepared by the House Managers and signed only by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.787" offset="14686542">Therefore, simply because of human nature and nothing else, it has to be taken with somewhat of a grain of salt where the House receded and there is an indication in the House conference report that they really hadn't given up as much as would appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.664" offset="14754043">On the other hand, it seems to us to be terribly persuasive when the House says that we have gone along absolutely with the Senate view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.057" offset="14787584">And, this is what the con-- the House conference report says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.971" offset="14803257">The conference agreement follows the provisions of existing law in the case of Section 8 (5) which makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to refuse to bargain collectively with the representative of his employees subject to the provisions of Section 9 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.468" offset="14873266">Now, if that isn't a congressional ratification of at least the broad outlines of the laws that stood before and, as I said, the law as it stood before was whether or not employer committed unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.915" offset="14927078">If the Union presented him with convincing evidence, he had an obligation, some obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.882" offset="14954872">The term “what was convincing evidence” wasn't flushed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.775" offset="14970441">That's why we say that that question is open to the Board on remand, but the essence, the objective essence, of the good faith standard seems to us to have been quite clearly ratified by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="3769.977" offset="15183287">And, in the Senate report, it explained what it was intent upon and we've reproduced the relevant portion of that explanation on page 17, and it said “the present Board rules which,” and I interject here, “which allowed employer to petition for an election only where two Union, who were seeking representative status, discriminate against employers who have reasonable grounds for believing that labor organizations claiming to represent the employees are really not the choice for the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.533" offset="15333543">And, what our view of what Section 9 (c) (1) (b) was intended to do was to deal with a situation that the pre-1947 law didn't really deal with, and that situation is the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="3819.735" offset="15382340">The Union appears on the scene and says “we represent a majority of your employees.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.465" offset="15413269">The employer says “give us some proof,” and again the Union says “we will not give you some proof, but we're going to engage in outsider picketing or minority picket,” which was lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.250" offset="15468335">The employer said “well, I will recognize if you could prove up your majority.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.070" offset="15487666">At-- in that type of a situation, the employer could not get to the Board and we think Section 9 (c) (1) (b) says if he has a reasonable doubt, if the Union hasn't fulfilled its obligation of coming forward with convincing evidence, if the employer has fulfilled his affirmative obligations as the law was prior to 1947 to investigate the situation in determining whether or not the Union had convincing, then the employer could file his petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="4219.053" offset="16979571">Starting with Joy-Silk Mills, the Board took a subjective view to the good faith doubt standard that was in the law prior to 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="4230.617" offset="17025860">We read the pre-1947 cases as attemptings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4234.097" offset="17039757">Painstakingly, it may be, but it nevertheless is attempting to evolve a series of objective criteria to measure good faith doubt.</text>

            <text syncTime="4264.995" offset="17163368">There was criticism of the Board's position in two respects.</text>

            <text syncTime="4275.623" offset="17205896">Secondly, there was intellectual criticism chiefly from Judge Friendly and from others, interestingly enough, going all the way back to an opinion after 1947 by Judge Leonard Hand, again on the Board's view, that it was logical to impute bad faith in denying recognition from subsequent unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="4302.823" offset="17314670">Judge Friendly put the point that it was just as logical to believe that an employer could make sure that the Union didn't grant-- gained a majority by committing unfair labor practices as that he believe the Union already had a majority.</text>

            <text syncTime="4665.928" offset="18767078">I was discussing the 1947 amendments and, to what I've already said, I simply wish to note a citation, as I've mentioned, the only document we cited in our brief is the House conference report because we take it as a complete acknowledgment by the House that they had receded.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.167" offset="18876061">We'd also like to call to the Court's attention that in the two-volume legislative history of the NLRA at page 1539, Senator Taft inserted his explanation of the conference agreement and, there, he said the language of the conference agreement is identical with the corresponding provisions in the Senate amendment since the Senate conferees refused to yield to the House with respect to the provisions contained in the House Bill amending the provisions in Section 8 (2) relating to company-dominated Unions and subsection 8 (5) relating to collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="4733.695" offset="19038124">This means that the five unfair labor practices contained in the present NLRA remain unchanged.</text>
            <text syncTime="4742.412" offset="19073024">Now, I th-- it's our view that this situation is, therefore, the same as the Curtis Bros. case in 362 US 24 which is reviewed in our brief at pages 22-24 and quoted therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.584" offset="19133733">There, the Board, after 1947, attempted to make recognitional picketing by a minority of vile and unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.887" offset="19178872">They did so in the face of a conference report which said there's no intent to make recognitional picketing an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4776.803" offset="19210533">They're justification was we're only making minority recognitional picketing unlawful and, in conference, all they said was that they were not going to prohibit all recognitional picketing and it leaves us this smaller area in which to undermine, if I may, the congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4798.899" offset="19298931">And, the Court said, “absolutely not.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.779" offset="19318471">This is the same argument that's being presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4806.778" offset="19330487">The argument being presented here is that he conferees only wanted to continue the power of the Board to issue bargaining orders where the employer committed unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="4819.581" offset="19381687">There's not a word in the conference report to suggest that indeed, as we say, when you put all the pieces together the language of the Act which creates a duty and which doesn't relate it to violating other obligations imposed by the National Labor Relations Act by the law from 1935-1947, by the language of the House conference report, the language of Senator Taft in the Senate, what they were doing was cuing to the line that had been established in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="4854.220" offset="19520240">We think the Board has to cue to that line, not in any particular, not as to whether cards are enough or something else is enough, but so as not to make what was once a duty into a privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.758" offset="19570395">That, we think, the Board cannot do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4870.473" offset="19585233">I wanted to say some other things about Gissle.</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.357" offset="19604773">Most prominently, the fact that Gissel cites with approval Mine Workers versus Arkansas Oak Flooring, a case in this Court, a preemption case but a pre-garment preemption case which is cited and discussed at 25-27 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4894.453" offset="19681155">There, the Court stated the law as it understood it at that time after 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="4902.080" offset="19711666">They said, under Sections 8 (a) (5) and 9 (a) and by virtue of the conceded majority designation of the Union, the employer is obligated to recognize the designated Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4913.872" offset="19758895">“Conceded” there was used in the term of uncontroverted, as we indicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4920.924" offset="19787107">How Gissel can be thought to close the door on us here, in light of its discussion and citation of Mine Workers, we don't understand, nor do we think that there's any logical implication from the fact that Gissel says that where there are serious unfair labor practices there shall be a bargaining order, and where there aren't serious unfair labor practices there shall not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4949.397" offset="19901001">The Court in Gissel was discussing the remedial power of the Board to remedy a Section 8 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="4957.263" offset="19932453">As I started to say, the evolution had been to criticize the Board's good faith test insofar as that test made the existence of other unfair labor practices a basis for a finding of good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="4972.074" offset="19991698">And, what Gissel did and what the Board did at about the time of Gissel was to clean up this area and to say that, logically, what we are doing is entering an order to remedy the other unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.427" offset="20037047">We're really not making a finding of fact as to whether the U-- the employer had good faith doubt in refusing recognition in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4994.447" offset="20081142">And, at pages 32 and 33 of our brief, we cite and discuss a case called Steel-Fab Inc., a very recent Board decision, which the Board says precisely what I'm trying to say here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5005.360" offset="20124818">That what Gissel did was talk about the Board's power under Section 10 (c), it's power to remedy illegal discharges, illegal interrogations and so on, but it didn't say what 8 (a) (5) means.</text>
            <text syncTime="5017.738" offset="20174346">And, what the Board is really trying to do here is to say that 8 (a) (5) means nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5022.770" offset="20194408">There is no obligation on an employer strictly by 8 (a) (5), no obligation to recognize the Union selected or designated, only an obligation to recognize a Union certified, not only certified but a Union that has gone and gotten its certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.525" offset="20261491">And, why do we care?</text>
            <text syncTime="5041.178" offset="20268074">I think that's really the last question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5043.499" offset="20277373">I think that everything I've said thus far indicates that we're right on the law, but why do we care?</text>
            <text syncTime="5049.133" offset="20299943">And, the reason we care is that the law that the Board has adopted that the employers want here creates employer free choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5058.711" offset="20338186">The employer has a free choice to decide whether or not there will be an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="5063.026" offset="20355427">If he wants an election, there'll be an election.</text>

            <text syncTime="5067.349" offset="20372773">That is an employee free choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="5234.490" offset="21041298">There are cases in which employees are willing to manifest their desire to be represented in a way in which the employer can check.</text>
            <text syncTime="5244.989" offset="21083303">Where that is the case, we think that Congress has determined by keeping the words “selected or designated” by ratifying the pre-1935 law to let them do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5255.823" offset="21126666">That it hasn't gone to the proposition that its policy has not yet moved to the point of requiring an election no matter how strong the Union's proof is.</text>
            <text syncTime="5267.586" offset="21173687">I want to say one word in my few remaining seconds on Section 8 (b) (7).</text>
            <text syncTime="5275.334" offset="21204720">This is the second case this term where Section 8 (b) (7) has been dragged in by its heels, by counsel on a post-Taft basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5284.501" offset="21241396">The first was the important case which was argued a few months- a month or so ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="5290.186" offset="21264071">In that case, the Board relied somewhat on 8 (b) (7) even though the Board decision had not touched 8 (b) (7), and even though the Union argued that there was no picketing there but only hand-billing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5306.882" offset="21330944">Here, there is an explicit Board holding at page 171 of the NLRB petition appendix that 8 (b) (7) is irrelevant here because there is no-- because 8 (b) (7) does not relate to situations in which the employer has illegally refuse to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="5328.401" offset="21416939">Nevertheless, both Mr. Cohen and Mr. Come have stood up here and argued that Section 8 (b) (7) supports their view of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5336.597" offset="21449749">We think that that's completely impermissible.</text>

            <text syncTime="5368.407" offset="21577017">At page 591 of the Court's opinion in Gissel, the Court describes the Board's current practice as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="5382.546" offset="21633546">When confronted by a recognition demand based on the possession of cards allegedly signed by a majority of his employees, an employer need not grant recognition immediately but may, unless he has knowledge independently of the cards that the Union has a majority, decline the Union's request and insist on an election either by requesting the Union to file an election petition or by filing such a petition himself under Section 9 (c) (1) (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="5412.643" offset="21753919">Now, it is that description of the Board's current practice that the Court later on, in Gissel, found to be in accord with the policies of Section 9 (c) (1) (b) and, furthermore, later on in the Gissel opinion, in meeting the employer's argument that he's between Sila and Caribdus (ph) when faced with a card check because if he accepts it and the Union doesn't have a majority, he's guilty of a violation under Bernard Oaklin (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="5450.007" offset="21903444">But, if he attempts to question to find out whether it is in fact a majority of the employees supported, he'd be guilty of an 8 (a) (1) violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5465.397" offset="21964988">The Court, again, states that under the Board's current practice the employer is not obligated to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5474.225" offset="22000306">He can simply decline the recognition request.</text>
            <text syncTime="5479.123" offset="22019845">So that, insofar as what the Board's policy was at the time of Gissel, that was it and the Board made it perfectly clear that the employer was not obligated to file a petition under 9 (c) (1) but could invite the Union to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5498.031" offset="22095496">Now, secondly--</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="5499.628" offset="22101870">Well, did that reach independent knowledge?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="5502.674" stopTime="5705.238">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="5502.674" offset="22114095">No, it did not reach independent knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5505.320" offset="22124648">However, the Court in Gissel recognized, we submit, that the Board could reject the good faith doubt test and the Board, on reflection after Gissel, concluded, and we submit reasonably so, that the independent knowledge element would plunge the Board into the same good faith doubt picket that it was in under Joy-Silk.</text>
            <text syncTime="5541.229" offset="22268322">Now, with respect to the legislative history, the Board's position does not ignore the fact that Congress, in 1947, decided not to adopt the House proposal that would've made a Board certification the only basis on which you could predicate a bargaining obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5576.639" offset="22409906">The one exce-- one situation where that is not so is in a case of voluntary recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5585.665" offset="22446059">The second exception, which is the principle situation because that's where most of the card-based bargaining orders are found, are in a situation where the employer's unfair labor practices have precluded the holding of a fair election.</text>
            <text syncTime="5605.452" offset="22525158">If the House amendment had been adopted, you couldn't sustain a Gissel bargaining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5614.039" offset="22559535">You would've needed a certification notwithstanding the fact that the employer had engaged in all kinds of unfair labor practices that would've precluded the holding of an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="5625.775" offset="22606451">The third situation where a car-- a bargaining order can be predicated on a showing less than a Board election is in the Snow &amp; Sons situation where the employer agrees to a means other than a Board election and then doesn't like the results and reneges on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5648.353" offset="22696835">Now, therefore, we are in-- not in an area like Curtis or Insurance Agents where Congress had said “this is as far as you can go” and the Board is going further, but we're in the area where, and the Court of Appeals agrees on that point, where Congress did leave room for Board discretion, namely what sort of-- what situations are you going to permit a showing less than a Board election?</text>
            <text syncTime="5688.991" offset="22859316">And the Board, we submit, is reasonable in concluding that, short of the three situations that I have just outlined, an election is the means that is most likely to effectuate the overall policies of the Act.</text>
