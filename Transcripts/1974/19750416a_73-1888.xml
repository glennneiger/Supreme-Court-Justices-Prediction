            <text syncTime="17.994" offset="175313">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.857" offset="194748">The issue is whether a disputed area in lower Cook Inlet in Alaska constitutes historic inland waters as the state claims or constitutes areas of the high seas as the United States maintains.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.792" offset="250546">The issue arose in the following context.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.563" offset="261622">In March of 1967, the State of Alaska offered for a competitive oil and gas lease sale 2500 acres of submerged land in the portion of Cook Inlet in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.743" offset="318360">The United States brought suit shortly thereafter in the United States District Court for Alaska to quiet title and for injunctive relief arguing that the state had no authority to lease submerged lands in area of the high seas.</text>

            <text syncTime="80.682" offset="426088">My understanding is that that disclosing all the details that the idea was not the burden of this Court with the -- what appeared to be at the time a quite simple case.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.428" offset="477080">Unfortunately, I think that -- I think that prediction was not a very good one.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.566" offset="497664">And the case is now here.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.019" offset="515427">Alaska claimed that in response that Cook Inlet is a historic inland waters and therefore the state had title to the submerged lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.167" offset="560044">The District Court compiled a -- in the District Court, the parties compiled a record and after an eight-day trial, the District Court issued a memorandum opinion holding for the State of Alaska dismissing the United States complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.890" offset="634964">The Court instructed counsel for the State of Alaska to prepare findings of fact, conclusions of law which counsel did in Court subsequently signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.678" offset="674043">The United States appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.525" offset="681462">On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in a per curiam opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.327" offset="708629">The Court of Appeals subsequently state its mandate regarding foreign fishing under disputed areas of Cook Inlet on motion of the United States matter which I'll discuss later that the case is here at all, that there's any question whatsoever about the status of Cook Inlet is a function of its size and for convenience, I'd like to refer the Court to the map in the back of our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="587.485" offset="2453295">Under the convention, there's no question whatsoever that Cook Inlet is a bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.574" offset="2473671">The convention in Article VII defines bays as well-marked indentations whose penetration is such in proportion to the width of the coast that they contained landlocked waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.324" offset="2516720">Cook Inlet meets that definition but under the convention, just because a body of water can be defined as a bay, it does not mean that it contains inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.538" offset="2557576">The convention prescribes a geographic test for determining whether a body of water is inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.190" offset="2580146">The geographic test is whether the distance between the natural headlands and the natural headlands here at least the Court -- the District Court said were 47 miles wide that is the net line is not shown on the map.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.717" offset="2634271">It's from Cape Douglas to Cape Elizabeth.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.620" offset="2641899">It's approximately 47 miles and so if you drew a line across the natural headlands of Cook Inlet, one would not come to the conclusion that this is a juridical bay and you'd have to use a fallback line.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.075" offset="2695711">You'd have to move a 24-mile line up into the penetrate -- the Alaskan Coast until you reach Kalgin Island and at that point, you could draw a 24-mile line in closing the maximum area of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.750" offset="2750360">So the question -- if one looked only at those provisions of the convention, one would come to the conclusion obviously that the area in dispute here does not comprise inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.610" offset="2793827">However, the provisions of the convention on Article 7 to which I've just referred have as a last paragraph the foregoing provisions do not apply to so-called historic bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.881" offset="2846908">The question therefore is although Cook Inlet does not comprise a juridical bay in the area that we're talking about, does it nevertheless comprise an historic bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.940" offset="2899153">In determining that question which is one of international law, this Court has looked to a comprehensive United Nations study entitled the Juridical Regime of Historic Waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.760" offset="2946382">Three broad factors have to be taken into account in determining whether an area is historic waters, historic inland waters, one that exercise of authority by the claiming nation to the continuity of that exercise whether it's been done for a considerable length of time and three of the attitude of other nations, acquiescence by other nations in the exercise, the question becomes somewhat unreal before this Court though because what we're talking about is really a domestic dispute and it's difficult to talk about the attitude of other nations and claims being opposed when it's really an internal dispute within the United States, between the state and the Federal Government and therefore this Court has instructed that in looking at these questions, one must treat them as if made by the national sovereign and oppose by other nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.383" offset="3152854">In that sense, this Court approaches the problem as if it were an international tribunal adjudicating a claim asserted by the United States and opposed by other countries and the rest of the countries in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.432" offset="3197053">In that light, it's quite important to observe that the longstanding United States foreign policy has been to limit national claims, territorial claims in the oceans of the world, whether made by expanding inland waters or by extending the territorial sea or in any other matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1162.355" offset="4752802">They were in territorial seas and maybe that seizure was proper at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1418.201" offset="5776175">This was the clearest assertion of sovereignty over Cook Inlet, this particular incident that I refer to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.330" offset="5800730">Now, beyond that, there are other fishing regulations that are involved in this case that applied to the Cook Inlet area from the years 1906 until Alaska became a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.353" offset="5852766">The one important factor that I like to bring about them is that not a single time in the entire history of this inlet, the disputed portion of this inlet was a foreign vessel or a foreign national ever arrested, ever, not one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.403" offset="5920998">Now, could be, one could say that nevertheless, there could be an assertion of sovereignty because Cook Inlet was so well recognized, so well respected by the other nations of the world that date and no nation dare to enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.821" offset="5970631">No nation dared put its ships into Cook Inlet without seeking specific permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.615" offset="5989857">That's not the case in regard to Cook Inlet because the fact of the matter is that there has been foreign fishing by Canadians for halibut, within the inlet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.702" offset="6026219">It's documented in the record for 1943 through to 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.683" offset="6046072">Now, I'd like to refer to the Court, the one finding of the District Court's opinion because we don't dispute it but I think it's rather misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.089" offset="6071777">It's on page 101, or finding 101 on page 44 (a) of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.749" offset="6134366">I'm sorry, petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.620" offset="6157876">101 says that the -- the finding 101 says that the fishing for halibut by Canadians was de minimis because there were possibly only two undetected instances before Alaska statehood 1959 and after that, careful with the language, only five Canadian vessels have fished for halibut in Cook Inlet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.051" offset="6243558">That's absolutely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.237" offset="6248364">What the Court has not mentioned is that happened on 20 different occasions for a total of 115 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.122" offset="6283891">Nevertheless, the point of the Court's holding in this regard that one can disregard the entry of Canadian vessels into Cook Inlet because of their infrequency is in our view a direct contradiction of international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.655" offset="6338017">The juridical regime that the Court has referred to points out that it may be that no action is necessary but whenever any action is necessary in order to prevent -- in order to assert sovereignty over a particular area, that action must be taken or historic title cannot ripen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.749" offset="6426415">So therefore, Canada or the Alaska or the United States when the United States have this territories, is fair to take any action against the Canadian vessels, we think stops, prevents historic title from ripening.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.952" offset="6475212">Now, the District Court pointed out, nevertheless, there were a great many instances of action against Americans, United States citizens that were fishing in Cook Inlet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.612" offset="6521814">Let me point out that throughout the entire findings of fact in the District Court's opinion, in the 9th -- in the 20th century, the District Court documented six arrests of American citizens prior to statehood within the disputed area of the inlet, just six.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.429" offset="6589106">After statehood, on one day, July 6, 1970, the District Court documented two arrests of the United States citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.552" offset="6621602">There are some testimony in the record and we think the District Court could not rely upon this of officials at who had various times patrol Cook Inlet who were asked, what would you have done had you seen a foreign vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.079" offset="6675728">They testified, “Well, we would have seized it or we would have done this or that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.373" offset="6692864">The District Court, we think improperly relied upon that testimony, the requirement of international law is that an assertion of sovereignty be open and notorious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.947" offset="6731212">It has to give other countries of the world an opportunity to respond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.371" offset="6748871">The inner intentions of officials who patrolled Cook Inlet, we do not think rises to that kind of open and notorious action and the District Court properly relied upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.831" offset="6802683">As far as fishing is concerned in general, the fact that the United States regulates fishing of its own citizens even on the high seas is of no consequence whatsoever for determining whether internationals sovereignty, sovereignty as over inland waters has been asserted over a particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.274" offset="6876453">The United States can exercise sovereignty or exercise authority over its own United States citizens regardless of whether they're in the territorial sea, the contiguous zone or even on the high seas itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.556" offset="6925563">The fact that in the middle of Cook Inlet, United States citizens, six of them were arrested in the 20th century, to us is meaningless, to the District Court, quite important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.111" offset="6963806">We think that was clear error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.197" offset="6972165">The Court also relied upon various other particular actions, the Alien Fishing Act that was passed in 1906.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.355" offset="7000795">The District Court said this was a clear assertion, the earliest clear assertion of sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.911" offset="7018977">I invite the Court to look at the Act when it says that no alien can fish within the waters of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.116" offset="7043845">That doesn't tell you where the waters of Alaska are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.999" offset="7055339">It doesn't tell you whether the United States exercised jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.319" offset="7068609">Before I leave this point, I think the most important, one of the most important facts is that in 1952 and again in 1953, before Alaska became a state, there was a controversy or question developed within the bureau of fish and wildlife that was patrolling the area about whether they could arrest the foreign vessel within the middle of Cook Inlet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.579" offset="7157739">They said and they determined Director Day who was then the national director of the Fish and Wildlife Service determined and instructed the people in Alaska that they could not because the middle of Cook Inlet was high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.535" offset="7209462">Again, I think that undercuts any idea that this is a claim of sovereignty and it was error for the District Court to rely upon these facts which occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="1867.812" offset="7574653">The maps were drawn by two Department of Interior employees which makes it suspect immediately how could that be that one would suspect that the geographers of the state department would set the international boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.504" offset="7617390">But beyond that there are not even straight baselines in conformity with the convention because the convention requires for straight baselines that the lines touch land each time a straight line is drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.569" offset="7661693">If you look at this map, you'll find islands that are ringed by square lines.</text>

            <text syncTime="1898.403" offset="7697011">In point of fact, the District Court relied upon this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.639" offset="7709968">We think it was a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.187" offset="7716133">I won't mention the disclaimers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1920.452" offset="7785200">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.069" offset="7807666">In the short time that I presume to take this morning, I would like to ask the Court or invite the Court's attention to two points, two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.380" offset="7872867">The first issue maybe fairly stated I think in this inquiry has there been an expressed or explicit claim of jurisdiction over Cook Inlet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.348" offset="7948727">If so, and Alaska claims it is so, then the two following elements we think fall easily into patent, the continuity of the assertion, the acquiescence of foreign nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.334" offset="8028662">In 1924, Congress enacted what is popularly known as the White Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.627" offset="8069831">The purpose of the White Act was to protect the fisheries of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.256" offset="8104417">The Act authorized the Secretary of Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.046" offset="8131584">In Subsequent years, the Secretary of Interior, and I quote, “To set a part and reserve fishing areas in any of the waters over which the United States has jurisdiction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.102" offset="8219773">These are the key words, “any of the waters over which the United States has jurisdiction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.043" offset="8263555">These words set the stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.894" offset="8282990">For what thereafter, the Executive Department of the Government was to do was it to set apart Cook Inlet as waters over which the United States claimed jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.710" offset="8354252">Was it to set aside only a part of the waters, for example three miles from the coastlines?</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.216" offset="8388211">What did the department, the Executive Branch do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.434" offset="8421125">It set apart 12 fishing areas, geographically by name, by definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.996" offset="8471385">In the 11 of those 12 areas, the secretary was careful to limit jurisdiction claimed by the use of the words territorial, coastal waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.276" offset="8564485">It might be helpful to the Court to look at just how this was done, page 1171 of volume 2 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.482" offset="8621328">Look at the definition for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.799" offset="8642539">I'm selecting this at random, of Bristol Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.603" offset="8669811">The Bristol Bay area is hereby defined to include all territorial, coastal and tributary waters of Alaska from Cape Newenham, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.551" offset="8733550">Look at the definition of the Kodiak area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.643" offset="8749955">The Kodiak area is hereby defined as to include the waters of the mainland shore extending and so on and the territorial coastal and tributurial waters of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.928" offset="8819127">Now, traditionally, the Solicitor has argued this, both here this morning and in his brief and we don't dispute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.432" offset="8861132">The United States sets it's delimited its claim of territorial sea to the breadth of three miles and what then is the significance of the use of this language territorial coastal waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.168" offset="8943992">Secretary of Interior, Udall, in a letter dated April 20, 1962 to the Secretary of State explained the significance of these words and he said that the use of the territorial coastal waters indicated an intent to limit the claim of sovereignty in those districts to three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.565" offset="9081605">We may agree that's in line with this traditional assertion of three miles for territorial sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.210" offset="9132178">I have said, this was done in 11 of the districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.495" offset="9157360">Look at the definition of Cook Inlet, the 12, page 1171, definition Cook Inlet area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.805" offset="9210546">The Cook Inlet area is hereby defined to include Cook Inlet is tributary waters an all adjoining waters, north of Cape Douglas and west of Point Gore, the Barren Islands are included within this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.865" offset="9318797">Notice the absence of the words territorial coastal waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.351" offset="9368743">In talking about territorial coastal waters, Secretary Udall and probably so said the use of that islands and no I'm quoting, “Negates any assertion of jurisdiction over the entire waters.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.985" offset="9435303">But what about Cook Inlet?</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.947" offset="9447111">We suggest and the Government has never answered this argument that if today, the federal government was the author of that definition, was given the chore of asserting jurisdiction overall of Cook Inlet, he could not have chosen clearer or more precise words, are more encompassing words than the words “all of the waters.”</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2369.165" offset="9580022">But you say this argument was Mr. Phillips?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas M. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="2371.990" offset="9591306">This -- this Mr. Justice Brennan is the regulations put out each year for 33 years by first the Department of Commerce, Secretary of Commerce and later years, the Secretary of Interior, defining as the Act required him to do to set apart certain areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.007" offset="9719411">In the lower court, the Government's chief witness was a man named Howard Balso who had testified that he have some experience and expertise in drafting these definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.175" offset="9800077">We've asked him if he could draft one so far as Cook Inlet was concerned that could use words that would more clearly assert jurisdiction than the language I've read to you and of course he said he could not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.441" offset="9865174">Now why, the Court may ask was Cook Inlet singled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.291" offset="9900492">It's not an accident because it was done year after year, after year for 33 years, from 1924 to 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.174" offset="9944064">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.011" offset="9951378">There are three reasons and they're undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.101" offset="9967783">First, there was judicial precedent for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.750" offset="9986382">In 1892, a Federal District Court sitting in Alaska had held that no part of the waters of Cook Inlet were international waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.813" offset="10046673">Secondly, as a reason, Cook Inlet unlike any other of the submerged lands cases that this Court has said and considered though it be enlarged body of water, is uniquely surrounded by the lands of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.312" offset="10152626">If the Court please, here as I point, is Cook Inlet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.254" offset="10196407">We look at the whole map of Alaska as we take it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.241" offset="10228381">You see this area that I am pointing to, Cook Inlet, almost surrounded by the lands of Alaska and this geographic fact undisputed was of significance to the District Court in the Kodiak decision in 1892 and it is dealt with that length by the lower court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.833" offset="10346663">A third reason why Cook Inlet was singled out, the evidence is undisputed and the lower court found in these findings of fact that from the very beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.848" offset="10426807">All of the waters of Cook Inlet have been vital to the interest of the inhabitants of the shores of Cook Inlet.</text>

            <text syncTime="2592.328" offset="10472678">So, what you're telling us about the effect of White Act is certainly a strongly controverted by the secretary entrusted with its enforcement that is and the Secretary Udall back in April of 1962 who says these regulations were not intended to enlarge or extend the territorial waters of Alaska in a legal or jurisdictional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.668" offset="10582079">He also says that they were enforced only three years, 1957, 1958, 1959 and never enforced against any foreign nationals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2636.634" offset="10649893">Now, in the first place, you'll notice that he's not talking about Cook Inlet and he's stressing as I pointed out a moment ago the use of the words territorial coastal waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.727" offset="10706317">Now, if it's fair for him to say these words limit jurisdiction and it is fair for him to say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.586" offset="10745710">It's fair for us to say when those words are not put in the definition of Cook Inlet but the words are “all the waters”, then I think Secretary Udall's reasoning enforces the claim, Mr. Justice Stewart that Alaska makes here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.278" offset="10824495">At least that's our argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="2730.329" offset="11024697">Yes, salmon was the important fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.033" offset="11039535">The third reason that Cook Inlet was pointed -- was singled out was that which the trial court found and based on undisputed evidence as far as we're concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.932" offset="11095124">Now, accepted by the federal government is that if this fishing had not been controlled for the benefit of the American people, those fishing areas would have been destroyed to the economic disaster of out of people of America and the citizens and residents of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.992" offset="11199300">One final point, Chesapeake Bay is a historic inland bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.855" offset="11238797">It has substantially the same words that were seized upon by a Court that recognized Chesapeake Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.658" offset="11293968">The language that described a revenue district, Chesapeake Bay overall the waters, shores, bays, harbors and inlets comprehended within the line drawn from Cape Henry to the mouth of the James River.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.024" offset="11379440">If it's logical that Chesapeake Bay was held to be by this language, a historic inland bay by the same language is logical that the trial court found that Cook Inlet was a historic inland bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.258" offset="11476407">Let me pass to the second issue that I want to talk about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.056" offset="11499604">The claim like all out Alaska has done has been approved that this is a historic territorial sea rather than a historic inland bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.965" offset="11559267">We say that argument is wrong both legally and factually.</text>

            <text syncTime="2888.101" offset="11655816">The juridical regime points out that a state which forbids foreign ships to fish therein undisputedly demonstrates by such action as desired to act as a sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.922" offset="11743065">Well, of course, where a nation's laws have been so clearly stated as a judicial regime also recognizes the foreign nations can recognize those laws and not come in that event of course, there's no occasion to enforce the law and the findings bear on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.164" offset="11848077">Let me legally address that argument however, the argument that we've shown only a territorial sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.946" offset="11883186">The dominant -- the juridical regime states that the dominant opinion is that when you talk about historic bays, you are talking about inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.261" offset="11944417">The convention on territorial sea and contiguous zone, Article 7 permits a line to be drawn between the entrance points of a bay where the entrance points are not farther than 24 miles apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.299" offset="12020590">That line encloses inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.315" offset="12036681">Section 6 accepts historic bays from that 24-mile restriction so that if you draw a line across the entrance points on the exception of historic bay, that line necessarily encloses inland waters.</text>

            <text syncTime="3075.692" offset="12406157">As this Court is aware and as there is no dispute, there are three criteria evidentiary wise upon which a bay's status is characterized as historic, that is to say, the exercise of sovereignty over a considerable period of time with the acquiescence of foreign nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.366" offset="12492884">With respect to sovereignty, the striking fact of this case is that witness after witness, without objection by United States incidentally relative to this petition for writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.039" offset="12563519">No objection was made as to the introduction of any of this evidence in the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.815" offset="12586611">Witness after witness testified to continual patrols, continual arrests, continual boardings of vessels and continual vessel arrests from the year, if we begin with the Kodiak case, 1892 up through 1971 and the boardings and patrols were testified too by the principal witness of the United States, Mr. Howard Balso as being a very significant act of enforcement and what was the enforcement to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.618" offset="12741883">Principally, two things:one, witness after witness, uncontradicted and the Court so found testified that Cook Inlet from the line drawn by the Court, that is to say Point Gore, Barren Islands, Cape Douglas, was patrolled for the purpose of enforcing the Alien Fishing Act, an Act which specifically prohibited aliens fishing in waters of Alaska under the jurisdiction of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.444" offset="12873122">The United States would tend to disregard this evidence and say that the definition of waters of Alaska was unclear in the Alien Fishing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.887" offset="12914918">But it is important to recognize that the Act was passed only six years after the Kodiak decision of which Congress must have been presumably aware of which defined all of Cook Inlet as inland waters of the United States not international waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.986" offset="12991300">That definition was incorporated into the Alien Fishing Act and enforced by agents and patrol officers of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.154" offset="13031946">It is important that testimony on this point is clear and uncontradicted and the lower court found this to be so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.336" offset="13072697">Secondly, as to continuity, two expert witnesses called by the State of Alaska testified that based upon their historic research again uncontradicted and found by the lower court that the usage or that the activities by the United States over all of Cook Inlet were such as to have developed into a usage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.330" offset="13184711">This is the criteria specifically set forth by the legal document which no one to this date has objected to and all agree as the criteria by which historic bay status is achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.665" offset="13246046">That is the jurisdiction of the United States had established a usage over all of Cook Inlet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.167" offset="13276035">Two expert witnesses in the area, in the field of history again Alaska complied with what this Court had set to be the evidentiary standard and cases of this sort that is, they are principally factual cases left to the discretion of a trier of fact to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.925" offset="13371120">Based upon unrefuted evidence, the trier of fact in this case found that the sovereignty of the United States had been exercised, had developed into a usage over all of Cook Inlet for a considerable period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.880" offset="13446875">Perhaps the most interesting feature of this case is the third requirement and that is the requirement of acquiescence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.299" offset="13496613">First, I would like to deal since it was dealt at length in the Solicitor's argument with the Shelikof Strait incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.737" offset="13554291">Contrary to the United States' position and this is undisputed again in the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.126" offset="13587832">Consistently throughout this case, both in the trial court, the Court of Appeals and now this Court, the Government has refused to recognize the significance of this incident with respect to Cook Inlet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.695" offset="13650108">One need only refer to the Japanese note of protest which appears at page 3 (a) of the appendix to the United States' brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.839" offset="13698696">The Japanese, notwithstanding what the United States now says certainly believed that the sovereignty asserted by the State of Alaska was over Cook Inlet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.701" offset="13754180">They certainly believed that the agreement entered into by the Japanese fishermen not to fish in Shelikof Strait and Cook Inlet applied to Cook Inlet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.877" offset="13806843">The note itself says, the commitment made by the east specific fisheries company to the Alaska state authorities to abstain from operations in the Shelikof Strait and the Cook Inlet was made without knowledge of the Government of Japan.</text>
