            <text syncTime="263.659" offset="1158040">Exhibit Two in the supplemental brief to be found starting on page 25 is a draft order of the Supreme Court of the State of Louisiana implementing the intention of the convention.</text>

            <text syncTime="2090.885" offset="8466892">One, it's administratively convenient to exclude the women as a class, and the other is we must be concerned with family stability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.991" offset="8511300">As far as the administrative convenience of a lump exemption of an individual project excuse is concerned, this Court's decisions in Reed v. Reed 404 U.S. and Frontiero v. Richardson 411 U.S., should be dispositive administrative ease is not sufficient to justify legislative resort to a gender criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.134" offset="8603878">With respect to ensuring the care of dependence, particularly small children, the women only exemption is a appallingly overbroad, and stereotypically underinclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.937" offset="8647137">Overboard because it includes the childless woman, the woman whose children are grown, the woman who can provide without hardship or care consistent with her family's needs while she's away from home and underinclusive because it does not encompass men among them without fathers husbands with incapacitated wives whose presence at home maybe essential to the family's well-being, but the total rationality of the Louisiana classification is demonstrated by census data and labor market statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.058" offset="8795617">Focusing on the statistics for Louisiana set out at pages 18 and 19 of our brief, in 1970, 59% of Louisiana's total adult female population had no children under 18 and of the 41% with children under 18, 37% were in the labor force.</text>
