            <label>Mr. Jerome B. Falk, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="47.516" offset="293386">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.731" offset="306343">The issue which this case presents is whether an indigent defendant who under controlling state law is not free to select the counsel of his choice, and who must permit the lawyer appointed for him to control presentation of his defense, whether such a defendant is entitled to forego counsel and represent himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.293" offset="380531">Although no holding of this Court squarely controls decision, this Court has on several occasions spoken of a right of self-representations in circumstances which fairly can be described as considered dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.981" offset="435284">The California Supreme Court in People versus Sharp two years ago decided that there was no constitutional right under state or federal law to representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.094" offset="475721">And this case was decided pursuant to that controlling decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.761" offset="490454">This petitioner was originally allowed by the trial court to represent himself having been quizzed at some length by the trial judge, and found to have voluntarily and knowledgeably waived his right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.042" offset="539564">Then the Sharp case intervened and some six days later, the trial court called petitioner before it, asked him a series of questions not concerning -- not addressed to his waiver, but addressed to his ability to represent himself as a defendant without a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.408" offset="609050">He answered those questions, I would -- he answered them rather well in most instances, but at the conclusion of the colloquy, the trial court found him to be inadequately prepared to represent himself, and terminated his right to represent himself and appointed the public defender.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.952" offset="683133">The Court of Appeal affirmed on the authority of Sharp and the California Supreme Court denied a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.860" offset="706853">This case has to be seen in light of the California law -- in three aspects of California law which bear on a defendant and his representation by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.946" offset="755127">In the first place it is clear that under California law, a defendant who is indigent and who seeks the appointment of counsel takes the lawyer assigned to him by the court be he be public defender or a private attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.618" offset="809880">The defendant has no right under any circumstances which I know of, under the cases to select the lawyer of his choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.247" offset="836315">He may therefore get a lawyer who he does not choose and whom he may have no confidence.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="187.909" offset="855019">Nothing unusual about that.</text>

            <text syncTime="189.200" offset="860139">No, Your Honor there is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.231" offset="868289">And in fact in none of the three respects I'm about to speak to is California law unusual, and I ought to say further that in none of those three respects do we quarrel with it as applied to a voluntary attorney-client relationship.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="205.022" stopTime="216.757">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="205.022" offset="923460">Do you -- would you think there was anything unusual about people of modest means and not always getting the lawyer they would like to have?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jerome_b_falk_jr" startTime="216.757" stopTime="264.788">
            <label>Mr. Jerome B. Falk, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="216.757" offset="970376">No, Your Honor and I perceive no constitutional right to pick ones own counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.484" offset="993259">I have no quarrel with California law in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.276" offset="1004440">I merely describe it because it does bear on the consequences when the defendant is unhappy.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.286" offset="1032547">The second feature of California law is that once a lawyer is in the case, that lawyer runs the show.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.074" offset="1055640">And again I don't quarrel with this in the normal voluntary relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.111" offset="1071835">But the lawyer under California law has the broadest powers with respect to decisions in the course of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.312" offset="1096600">There are only three exceptions that I know of. One is the decision to plead guilty, second is the decision whether or not to have a jury, and the third is the decision whether or not to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.651" offset="1149994">Say for those three exceptions, the lawyer makes all decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.699" offset="1162219">Yes sir?</text>

            <text syncTime="265.925" offset="1167026">Whether or not to testify, Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.241" offset="1176325">Counsel can not keep his client off the stand against the client's desire to testify.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="272.685" offset="1194088">Those standards, they're consistent of the standards established by the American Bar and Criminal Justice Project, do they not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jerome_b_falk_jr" startTime="279.073" stopTime="378.025">
            <label>Mr. Jerome B. Falk, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="279.073" offset="1219688">They are identical with the ABA standards Mr. Chief Justice and I again don't quarrel with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.920" offset="1243094">I think a lawyer has to run this show and the consequence however is that when the lawyer runs this show, he makes decisions for his client, which directly affect constitutional rights, whom to cross-examine, whether or not to call a particular witness, whether to make a motion to suppress allegedly a legally obtained evidence, whether to seek a continuance and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.259" offset="1324387">Again, where the relationship is voluntary, we see no difficulty with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.787" offset="1342568">Finally, the third aspect of California law, again one which is not unusual is that there is extremely limited appellant review of the performance by a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.117" offset="1383842">The standard is set forth in our brief. It essentially boils down to egregious cases reducing the trial to a farce or a sham.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.954" offset="1423235">Now, when the defendant and his lawyer are coerced in their relationship with one another, then these three concepts become manacles on the defendant's presentation at his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.881" offset="1478928">This is so even if it has an objective matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.849" offset="1490735">The lawyer is a very competent lawyer, and I prepared to believe that most are, California and elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.365" offset="1520828">But where the lawyer is less than competent or where the defendant perceives him not to be competent, the relationship becomes a terribly difficult one.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.362" offset="1560848">And I have certainly no desire in this case to put the legal profession on trial, but some realism has to allow consideration for the fact that not all lawyers are able, that there are some lawyers practicing criminal law in California and elsewhere who are far less than able and --</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="378.025" offset="1615496">That's true even of retained counsel, isn't it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jerome B. Falk, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="380.164" offset="1624064">That is true even of retained counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.996" offset="1635349">And as I'll mention in a moment, one of the interesting things is that the California court solicited with respect to a defendant's presentation of his defense that was asserted here does not carry over into the area of retained counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.370" offset="1692818">In fact the California Supreme Court has gone so far as to hold in the case called Smith versus Superior Court that a appointed lawyer who was found by the trial court to be incompetent cannot be replaced over the objections of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.808" offset="1758647">The California Supreme Court decided that case in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.583" offset="1769723">It's still a good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.177" offset="1776097">Of course if the performance proves to be incompetent, there may be a reversal, but the trial judge must leave that relationship undisturbed even if the trial judge comes to the conclusion that the trial counsel is incompetent.</text>

            <text syncTime="430.445" offset="1825102">Does the, under the California judges, ever in that situation apply it to yet another lawyer to act as a friend of the court and assist?</text>

            <text syncTime="441.151" offset="1867943">I have never heard of them doing that where there is a lawyer in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.199" offset="1884139">They can and do appoint standby counsel in cases where defendants seek to represent themselves, or at least they did before the Sharp case.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.472" offset="1913292">There have not been many instances of self-representation since the Sharp case to my knowledge.</text>

            <text syncTime="457.031" offset="1931473">Of course in mid trial it would be kind of hard to either replace the man who was assigned and it would be kind of difficult to get a new man in on the third day of the trial who could do much good, wouldn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="468.447" offset="1977135">The Smith case actually was a case that had not yet commenced trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.604" offset="1993749">It had been a case in which the lawyer -- it was a really quite an extreme case.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.883" offset="2010885">The lawyer had been appointed previously, represented the man on a previous trial, had been reversed, sent back.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.934" offset="2039097">In the meantime the lawyer had been found incompetent by a federal judge in another case and the judge, in the Smith case, was sufficiently concerned that he inquired and replaced the trial counsel before trial started.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.057" offset="2087581">California Supreme Court issued a writ in that case and ordered the trial court to replace the original lawyer, even though the trial court had found him to be incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.771" offset="2130422">And so the California courts -- the lesson from this is that the California Supreme Court and the California courts intervened very little in the presentation of a defense leaving that to the defendant and his counsel, except in one instance and that is this instance where the defendant seeks not to have a lawyer.</text>

            <text syncTime="548.961" offset="2299173">I mentioned all of these aspects of California law because they make clear that compelling a client relationship does more than the California Supreme Court recognized in the Sharp case.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.307" offset="2352567">That is, it does more than give the defendant layered on to what he had before.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.257" offset="2372420">Give him more than a benefit even though he may not want it.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.191" offset="2384123">It takes something away from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.511" offset="2389452">It takes away from him his rights which we deemed to be granted him by the Sixth Amendment to present the defense as he sees fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.018" offset="2423411">It's that mistake in conceiving of the way the issues arise in this case which led not only the California Supreme Court in our opinion, but also quite recently the Third Circuit to reject the right of self-representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.145" offset="2483911">Attorney General has sent to the Court a slip opinion of the Third Circuit which follows although without citing, it follows the Sharp precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.762" offset="2514422">It reasons as did the California Supreme Court that all that is at stake here is the right to reject that which the Right to Counsel Clause of the Sixth Amendment grants.</text>

            <text syncTime="700.742" offset="2906363">I think that drafting it that way would've left that kind of discretion in the trial courts and the framers surely didn't intend that.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.619" offset="2937814">I really need to elaborate, I think, on the point I left hanging a moment ago which is how we see the right of a defendant to present his defense in the confrontation and cross-examination clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.651" offset="2985984">The Attorney General's position with respect to that is that the right to present a defense, the right to confront, the right to cross-examine is a right that can be exercised for a defendant by an agent, by a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.210" offset="3036244">If that were so, then the right to be present, which this Court held on -- has held on many occasions to be a part of due process and part of the Sixth Amendment, would not derive from the Sixth Amendment because a defendant could confront his accusers and cross-examine through a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.217" offset="3120253">But the Court held in Illinois versus Allen following a long line of cases, the Sixth Amendment gives the defendant the right to be present.</text>

            <text syncTime="786.114" offset="3247835">I should also say that this defendant was entirely respectful on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.268" offset="3260479">There was not any instance of that in this case, nor in any of the 76 other reported appellate cases involving the right of self-representation in California which we've collected in appendix to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.316" offset="3304678">That kind of outrageous conduct that the courts in Illinois versus Allen and in Mayberry versus Pennsylvania is a rarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.575" offset="3333622">But in the right to be present cases, the court has seen the right of self-representation as involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.215" offset="3368208">In Snyder versus Massachusetts, the court explained the right to be present, as deriving from the defendants right and I quote “To give advice or suggestions or even to supersede his lawyers altogether and conduct the trial himself.”</text>
            <text syncTime="830.557" offset="3425573">So that is part of why we see the Singer case is not controlling because Singer involved simply the right to reject a protection of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.612" offset="3465801">And this involves another part of the Constitution, a right to present a defense, but there's another reason too why Singer doesn't control here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1952.053" offset="7911633">The issue of whether or not a defendant has a constitutional right to represent himself without counsel, and whether this exists in criminal trials, has been described in the words of the Second Circuit as to whether or not a defendant has a constitutional right to go to jail under his own banner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.502" offset="7989373">I submit Your Honors, that the defendant has no such right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.500" offset="8005360">Rather he has a right under the Constitution to a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.567" offset="8021661">A good working definition of a fair trial was set forth in the California case of People versus Sharp in 7 Cal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.984" offset="8047261">3d defining it as follows “proceedings which will accord him the fullest opportunity to preserve all trial rights and successfully defend against the charges.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.638" offset="8109955">A fair trial is the definition of due process, and to mandate that a defendant has a constitutional right to defend himself without counsel could have the opposite effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.832" offset="8162722">A good example is this case, and I must differ with petitioner in his interpretation of the taking away of the appropriate privileges in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2185.274" offset="8844518">Correct, under the federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.397" offset="8852982">And under the common law, self-representation was not a right but was a tyrannical practice enforced by crown and the kings to ensure victories, and to ensure the dissidence would kept down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.018" offset="8903450">And this of course was a hallmark of the Stewart's, now, the colonies when they begun having their own various states and colonies, had their own individual types of charters and constitutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.800" offset="8962591">Four states Pennsylvania, Vermont, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire made provisions for both counsel and self-representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.082" offset="8999685">The Judiciary Act of 1789 was debated at around the same time of the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.313" offset="9032600">The Judiciary Act of 1789 gave both a right to counsel and a right to self-representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.486" offset="9061334">Yet the Bill of Rights of the Sixth Amendment gives no such right of self representation while giving a right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.970" offset="9099264">Thus, it appears that the framers purposely did not want to make self representation a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.696" offset="9130193">A similar type of inference and a similar type of logic was made in the case of Singer versus United States by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.151" offset="9156002">Well, the Court had held that a right to waive a jury does not spring from the right to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.407" offset="9180975">And the Court stated “Indeed, if there had been any recognition of such a right, i.e. the right to waive jury, it would be difficult to understand why the Sixth Amendment was not drafted in terms as recognized an option.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.594" offset="9237713">380 U.S. at 31.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.443" offset="9249102">Thus, we submit the history gives no right and in fact the changes in history, cases such as Gideon and the recent cases of Sodo in the Third Circuit, and at People versus Sharp in our own state -- my own State of California seems to show a greater reliance on the necessity of counsel and questions any possible right of self-representation as being a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.485" offset="9357354">Due process does not give a right to represent oneself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.057" offset="9371564">Rather it is a right to fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.123" offset="9383894">A fair trial is fair if there are fair and efficient court procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.309" offset="9408658">Times had changed since the last hundred years and defenses are becoming more and more complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.939" offset="9431124">It's no longer the simple “Did you do it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.084" offset="9443662">A man can shoot somebody in front of a thousand witnesses yet have a perfectly good defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.501" offset="9473337">In California for example, we have a very complex defense known as diminished capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.871" offset="9490892">And this defense is more or less that of a defendant can not attain a certain state mind to commit a certain offense by reason of mental deficiency or disease or intoxication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.052" offset="9547630">He cannot be guilty of that offense or that degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.781" offset="9562467">Now, it would be almost impossible for a defendant in pro per to raise this in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.663" offset="9585977">Because one, he would have another law and the law is very technical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.137" offset="9603950">Two, you'd have to know how to examine and cross-examine experts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.712" offset="9622235">And three, perhaps most important of all, he would need to have an objective understanding and appreciation of the applicability of the defense of diminished capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.341" offset="9664763">Furthermore, defendant should know -- would have to know the complex motions to suppress by reason of search and seizure and proper forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.579" offset="9709693">Also, a defendant could be under drugs or withdrawal, and by reason of this, not be able to defend himself properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.669" offset="9734040">For example on this particular case, the attorney for Mr. Faretta said that at the time of the commission of the offense that the defendant, Faretta, was involved in dangerous drug activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.575" offset="9781687">This is found on page 64 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.416" offset="9801017">Therefore, because of the defenses and because of the mental problems that may face the defendant, there would be no right to self-representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.875" offset="9838843">Furthermore, the law is changing rapidly and because of these rapid changes, this would mandate the use of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.036" offset="9871548">Recently, this Court has come down with the decisions of Illinois versus Allen, Taylor versus United States, the former stating that if the defendant becomes disruptive, he could be removed from the courtroom, the latter saying that if the defendant should leave in the midst of his trial, the trial can go without him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.762" offset="9942392">If a defendant does not have counsel and either of the two aforementioned events takes place, the proceedings would unintentionally become an inquisitorial proceeding where no defense is tendered at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.567" offset="10005608">Again, I would submit Your Honors that due process requires a fair trial and not subject to whims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.706" offset="10042180">To say otherwise might encourage the cynical view that is more important that the accused believe that he is getting justice, rather than actually get justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2526.497" offset="10209364">As to -- I know, well I know no right which is not specifically enumerated in the Constitution which can be to my knowledge constitutionally waive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.632" offset="10253876">There have been no cases as of yet to my knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.809" offset="10266624">Singer is the perfect example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.563" offset="10293582">Petitioners pointed out that counsel in California make binding decisions, but these decisions which he list in his brief are very complex indeed, and are in the purview of a technician.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.898" offset="10343006">Thus, we need technical minds to best direct that offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.777" offset="10358471">The purpose of our legal profession, the training involved is to insure that trained individuals can be advocates in protecting the client's interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.827" offset="10398699">Now, petitioners argued that indigents may get a -- may not choose counsel in California and may not get along with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.260" offset="10432449">However, I think that this can be countered because first of all the trial is not a popularity contest to be won by smiles and handshakes, but rather is a serious business necessitating the best technical minds available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.910" offset="10483022">Furthermore, the defendant could possibly be a sociopath or mentally ill and not get along with any person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.356" offset="10504756">Thirdly, an attorney will have an objective understanding of the case which the defendant might not have because of his personal involvement in the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.842" offset="10550732">The purpose of due process as supported by the use of counsel, the court has recognize this in such landmark cases as Powell versus Alabama and Gideon versus Wainwright.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.373" offset="10592841">Again, as Singer has pointed out, there was no right to a jury trial waiver and this lack of a jury trial waiver did not violate any constitutional right because the Constitution guaranteed the defendant a right to jury, which was what the defendant got.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.108" offset="10655848">In the same manner, there's no right to appear without counsel and since the appellant -- since the petitioner receives the trial with counsel, he received what the Constitution guaranteed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard J. Schwab</label>
            <text syncTime="2663.112" offset="10755845">I'm not positive as to the court, but I know for sure the prosecution must also waive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.789" offset="10794506">Petitioners argued that since there's a right to counsel, there must be a correlative right for self-representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.400" offset="10828988">As mentioned before, there's no historical source of such a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.331" offset="10844662">Secondly, he mentions such cases as Adams versus United States ex rel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.119" offset="10863888">McCann, which has dicta on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.065" offset="10879666">However, these cases came down before the cases of Gideon and of Singer which have supported the necessity of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.234" offset="10920312">The Singer doctrine also came down after these opinions and thus because the defendant may be able to waive counsel would not mean that he has a right to waive counsel because as this Court said in Singer “the ability to waive a constitutional right does not ordinarily carry with it the right to assist upon the opposite of that right” 380 U.S. at 3435.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.538" offset="11013517">Thus, the correlative argument falls on its face because the Constitution guarantees a right to a fair trial and a right to due process, and it would be absurd to say that there be a correlative right to an unfair trial and to a lack of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.237" offset="11080286">Thus, Your Honors in conclusion, I submit there is not right to self-representation under the federal constitution or under either a historical Sixth Amendment or due process interpretation, rather what is mandated is a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.336" offset="11140681">As the trial court cautionly said in this case to Faretta, “I have seen more people represent themselves, convict themselves where if they just sat down and let somebody who knew what they were doing do it could well have won the lawsuit.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.572" offset="11213615">Thank you Your Honors.</text>
