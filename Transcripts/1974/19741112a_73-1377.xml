            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="45.047" offset="283564">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.756" offset="294431">These cases are here on writs of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.205" offset="320240">Each is in action seeking to compel the administrator of the Environmental of Protection Agency to increase allotments he has made under Title II of the Water Pollution Control Act Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.706" offset="374157">I had best described the statutory process which is deeply involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.736" offset="402265">This act provides federal funds to pay 75% of the cost to states and municipalities of the construction of sewage treatment facilities and the act -- the funding process the operations several stages.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.942" offset="463182">First, Congress must enact an authorization for appropriations of a certain size.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.150" offset="487946">Now, that is not an appropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.748" offset="494320">It's more of a statement of intent to appropriate on a later date and that begins this process.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.915" offset="519084">Second, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency working within that authorization allots various amounts to the states on a formula suggested by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.199" offset="572165">When that has been done, when the allotments has been made, the states make proposals for construction of water treatment facilities, sewage treatment facilities that they think are most pressing, and if these are approved, thus meeting with criteria, that approval by the administrator constitutes an obligation of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.779" offset="646457">And all that remained to be done is for the grantees to make the expenditures, Congress appropriates the funds and they are paid over to the grantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.907" offset="683029">Now, the issues we have today are two, and the first is whether the President acting through the administrator has discretion at the second stage of this process, that is the allotment stage, to allot the states amounts less than Congress has authorized to be appropriated.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.195" offset="764113">And second, if he has such discretion, whether that discretion is reviewable in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.746" offset="794311">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that there is no discretion at the allotment stage but there is some discretion at the obligation stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.187" offset="824090">The approval of plant, the Fourth Circuit assumed that there was discretion at the allotment stage, because the respondents, plaintiffs below in that case conceded it, and the District Court had found that and the Court of Appeals remanded for a trial de novo of whether assuming the discretion, the administrator had abused it or exceeded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.561" offset="905592">In a word, I think everybody agrees in this case that the President has discretion at some stage of this process.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.121" offset="935894">Now, I would like to make it very clear to at the outset to remove any element of drama from this case.</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="266.521" stopTime="665.665">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="266.521" offset="1169429">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.946" offset="1171205">We are making no constitutional argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.491" offset="1185311">I should also say that these statutes under which impoundment has occurred in the past, in many of which I think impoundment is no longer occurring, common of wide variety of shapes and forms and processes, so that these cases today before us are quite unlikely to settle the issue of withholding of funds under other statutory programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.767" offset="1286457">This statute is unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.532" offset="1301504">Well, to get to these cases, Congress authorized the appropriation of not to exceed $5 billion for fiscal year in 1973, and $6 billion for fiscal year 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.735" offset="1358346">The administrator of EPA at the direction of the President allotted for those years respectively two and three billion dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.817" offset="1390634">A total allotment of $5 billion as opposed to the $11 billion authorized for appropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.585" offset="1421667">Now, I should also say that the remainder, the administration position is that the remainder of these allotments will be made in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.608" offset="1457821">So, that this case concerns a rate of spending, rather than the total amount to be spent on this program over time.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.549" offset="1493556">I would address first the issue raised by the City of New York which is the stage of the process at which discretion maybe exercised and then I will discuss the issue raised by Campaign Clean Water, the case in the Fourth Circuit, the scope and reviewability of the discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.691" offset="1566177">When it gets clearer that the President's discretion is to be authorized at the allotment stage, and we have for that the rather mundane reason that that is what the statute says, and that we agree with Campaign Clean Water on that point and disagree with the City of New York on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.660" offset="1633991">Now, City of New York makes much plain of the fact that in the debates, various Congressmen who were engaged at that point in stressing the legitimacy of the President's impoundment of funds under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.289" offset="1700551">However, in stressing that discretion, that the President was to given used words like discretion overspending, discretion over obligation and it's almost entirely from that slim foundation, that the respondent tries to argue that Congress deliberately ruled out discretion at the allotment stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.941" offset="1779127">We think that in the face of the explicit language of the statute, that argument is altogether too thin.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.658" offset="1802010">And it's worth noting I think that this is a very natural way to talk about in impoundment issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.845" offset="1818728">Indeed, public discussion generally talks about the President's ability to control spending, even when under a technical statute, the discretion is authorized at some other stage than the actual payment of the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.047" offset="1879542">And that's an accurate way to speak because when the President directs the administrator not to allot the full sum, the result of course is a deferral of obligation and deferral of spending as well, and that's what the discretion is all about, ultimately the federal spending.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.179" offset="1944116">So, naturally Congressmen talked about it in those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.619" offset="1957804">And we can't place all that much weight on their failure in these debates constantly to use the quite technical terms of a very noble process, which this Act contains.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.526" offset="2009527">What we do know, unmistakably from the debate in the legislative history is that Congress intended to give the President discretion and that it did that, its vehicle for giving discretion, where the amendments proposed by Representative Harsha, who was a chief sponsor of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.001" offset="2091342">And those amendments were proposed to Sections 205(a) and Section 207.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.819" offset="2114644">Now, Section 205(a) which was amended for this purpose, is an allotment provision, and it's plain to us therefore that the discretion given is in making allotments.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.285" offset="2176502">As originally drafted, the House Bill said this, in Section 205(a), the allotment provision, it said, “All sums to be appropriated pursuant to Section 207th shall be allotted by the administrator.”</text>
            <text syncTime="534.177" offset="2240031">And Section 207 released authorized the appropriation of the amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.285" offset="2256541">Now, that language about allotment sounded quite mandatory to some.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.682" offset="2282141">All sums authorized shall be allotted.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.267" offset="2300426">Explicitly, to make sure that the President had discretion, the Harsha Amendment changed that, the word all was deleted, and from Section 205(a), so that the administrator was merely told to allot the sums authorized under Section 207.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.030" offset="2371480">And Section 207, in turn, was amended, to read that there was authorized that to be appropriated and then they added the words “not to exceed, five and six billion for the two years” in question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.659" offset="2433964">Now, if the intention, as the City of New York contends were to place discretion at the obligation stage, then as the other respondent points out, it will be quite extraordinary for Congress to choose to amend those allotment sections, they would've amended Section 203, which is the -- which is the obligation which provides to the obligation process to say that he need not obligate more than -- you may not obligate more than but may obligate less.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.069" offset="2571682">So, when we're faced with the statute, which provides discretion, provides discretion in the allotment provision, and when those amendments are known to have been intended to provide that discretion, for legislative history, I fail to see how the President, or the administrator, could responsively have ignored that text, allotted all the sums and then begun to exercise discretion at the obligation stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.836" offset="2678680">If the President had done that, I think the City of New York would've sued this.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.994" offset="2695398">I think they might we have contended that discretion is largely to the allotment stage, and once the allotments are made, and the rest is ministerial and that they are entitled to the funds, and I think they would have had a better argument than the one they have now.</text>

            <text syncTime="716.587" offset="2969684">But that goes less to the -- that goes to the existence and width of the discretion, rather than the stage at which it must be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.533" offset="3001553">And I should say this, that as a practical matter, the Government has very little interest in which way in at what stage the discretion must be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.077" offset="3051708">We brought this case up, the City of New York case, because if we acquiesce in the judgment that there was no discretion at the allotment stage, we thought we were quite likely be would sought it by another lawsuit in which the Court said, any discretion you had was at the allotment stage, now you must obligate, and so although everybody agree if he has discretion in there someplace, we would've lost it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1883.183" offset="7636093">These are two very separate cases because they were consolidated by the Court on the grant of certiorari, we have agreed with the respondents in the other case, the clean -- Campaign Clean Water case to divide our time, I will attempt to stay within the 15 minutes which I had originally planned on for the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.900" offset="7755003">The -- as we see it, the issue in this case, in the New York City case, it is very different –- it's very definitely the timing at which any kind of executive control over the rate of spending is to be exercised, not the scope of the discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1996.548" offset="8089579">Now at -– in point one of our brief, at pages 8 to 17, we have summarized that part of the legislative history which goes to the time at which whatever the discretion is, the time at which it should be exercised, and we believed that it is far clearer than the Solicitor General would have you believe.</text>

            <text syncTime="2038.659" offset="8258017">One does show as the Government maintains that the objective, the overall objective of those Harsha amendments was in the words of several of the legislation sponsors to emphasize the flexibility of the President's control over the rate of spending.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.041" offset="8363551">We do not -- we have no difference with the Government that that was the overall objective where we differ with the Government is as to when that control, whatever its scope was to be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.768" offset="8434395">In it's brief, the Government had virtually ignored the legislative history going to the second strand as to when it should be exercised, but included in our -- in the materials, in point one of our brief, are statements by sponsors of the Act in both Houses, both before and after the veto message which we believe clearly show that the Court of Appeals was correct in deciding that Congress intended that discretion to be exercised only at the obligational stage.</text>

            <text syncTime="2179.869" offset="8822888">Now, there's a statement which is quoted almost in full at page 23 of our brief by Representative Harsha on that planning process, it is -– it indicates several things, first of all, how important the planning process was to those who conceived and labored and drafted the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.576" offset="8937723">Secondly, it showed that they were interested not in bits and pieces, stop and go planning as various amounts of money might be allotted and allotted and allotted under the Government's theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="2411.750" offset="9750340">And in the course of our point one, we point to a statement by Mr. Harsha in which he said, he talked about the obligation stage, at which after the full planning of a project has taken place, and it is reviewed by the administrator, reviewed certainly for compliance with these conditions in the statute and perhaps we would –- for New York we would can see this, perhaps also for some fiscal considerations, at that point , is from the administrator by approval would either subject the United States to an obligation to pay that grant or by holding it up by non-approval, he would not subject the United States to that obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.161" offset="9952005">It is that point after all of the planning that we believe under appropriate circumstances, the executive could impose what might be called the hold on either a certain type of projects or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.751" offset="10010415">That would be the point right before the United States became obligated, but at any rate at that point, when the United States wanted to exercise the flexibility, the Act talks about, when the fiscal stringency had vanished, if you will, the plans would all up been made, you would have a shelf full of plans on the top, so to speak could be turned on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.420" offset="10113024">That we think is much more consistent with the underlying intent of Congress that this was a massive ambitious program and they wanted it done just as fast as it could possibly be done.</text>

            <text syncTime="2634.169" offset="10640071">But as I say that isn't easy question because of this and it might have to be settled in future litigation, although I think that has become much less likely since this new Budget Act of 1974, which now provides for quite a clear way in which Congress and the President can work cooperatively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.183" offset="10732126">If this Court should declare, should affirm and thereby declare that the full allotments had to be made, and then perhaps adding that the Harsha amendments conferred some discretion at the obligation stage, then the President would presumably make the obligation –- make the allotments, then at the later stage if it should be desirable for the -– if the President and his administrator should think it desirable to put a hold on the obligation of funds, that action would be subject to the new Budget Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3084.044" offset="12439594">Well, we think our reading of the statute and legislative history, we think it's pretty clear that the discretion was intended to be exercised at the allotment stage because it was the section of allotments and not the section on obligations that was amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.064" offset="12495600">They could've just as easily changed the mandatory language in Section 203 on obligations that to be discretion if they'd wanted to let the administrator exercise his discretion there.</text>

            <text syncTime="3120.999" offset="12587342">I believe that's correct, Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.611" offset="12601866">I'd like to focus primarily on the question, this afternoon, of how do we know that the administrator's discretion was intended to be limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.701" offset="12642200">And how do we gauge where those limitations lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.904" offset="12659022">I think perhaps the principal point of departure between Campaign Clean Water and the administrator is over what interpretive tools the Court relies on in determining whether there is discretion, whether there are limitations on the discretion and where the limitations lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.294" offset="12736554">The Solicitor General in his argument pointed primarily to the floor language, the remarks of Representative Harsha, and said it's from this that Congress intended to give discretion notwithstanding the remainder of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.375" offset="12800920">The Solicitor General would have this Court look more to what was done in the 11th hour in this statute and accuses us of ignoring this floor language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.193" offset="12840103">I suppose we would accuse the administrator of ignoring the entire remainder of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.459" offset="12865181">I think it's useful in answering the question how do you know what the limitations are to do two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.230" offset="12892244">First, to take a general overview of what went on here, of what went on in the Congress over this two-year period during which the statute was pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.878" offset="12930905">I think it's useful secondly to look at some of the specific provisions of the statute and just ask, what do these provisions mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.233" offset="12960266">Are they still effective if the administrator's view is upheld, that his discretion is virtually unbounded?</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.731" offset="12986284">First, the overview, the statute as we pointed out in our brief was two years in the making.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.190" offset="13012093">It was very carefully constructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.931" offset="13023065">From the beginning, the proponents of this statute sought to eliminate completely the discharges of pollution into our nation's waters and to do so in accordance with the prescribed time table.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.098" offset="13075728">They were fought at every step of the way by the executive branch, by the administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.114" offset="13095790">The administration opposed the level of funding; the administration opposed the contract authority mechanism of funding; the administration opposed having a rigid deadlines; it opposed having mandatory enforcement provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.008" offset="13167365">Despite this opposition, the bill was submitted to the Congress, was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.595" offset="13189726">The president as what his constitutional prerogative vetoed it, and he listed as his chief reason the level of spending called for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.639" offset="13221909">He would've suggested a lower level of spending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.931" offset="13235075">The bill was returned to the Congress and the veto was overwritten and was overwritten overwhelmingly in both Houses, and during the course of the debates on the veto override, people on both side of the aisle, the democrat Senator Muskie, the republican Representative Harsha all agreed that Congress was dictating that the job be done, that they knew it was expensive, they knew it would tax the nation's resources to some extent but that Congress had made that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.333" offset="13364746">The question, I think, we've got to ask in taking this overview is, is it reasonable to assume that in making this last minute change to achieve what was essentially a political compromise and it's attempt to avoid the veto, is it reasonable to assume that in making that change, the Congress intended to eviscerate the remainder of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.210" offset="13456175">I think the answer is going to be clearly not, and yet I think if you turn to some of the specific provisions of the statute, you'll find that that would indeed be the effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3444.697" offset="13882180">I think that his construction of that statute is correct, when he says that the triggering action by the executive must be one which was commenced after July 12, 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.014" offset="13931395">I don't think the Congress can do anything really about this, at least not right now, and at some point in the future, he may-- the administrator may take some further action, which would trigger the provisions of that statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3496.623" offset="14089906">I don't think that we, as litigants, should be forced to rely on the hope that if sometime in the future, Congress is going to bail us out, when Congress has already said I think pretty clearly what it intends to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.082" offset="14143718">That would be our position really on that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.219" offset="14160227">I think not only -– let me look -- let me spend one more minute on this question of the deadlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.169" offset="14200038">We've cited in our brief to a survey that was done by EPA last year, their 1973 Needs Survey, which was prepared pursuant to the statute that's at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.758" offset="14250402">In that survey, EPA concluded that -– and I'll speak here for the State of Virginia since that's the state I know best, that's where my group came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.991" offset="14291362">They said Virginia is going to need $650 million roughly just to meet the 1977 deadline, just to meet that secondary treatment deadline in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.532" offset="14337546">Now, 75% of that of course should come from the Federal Government under this legislation that will be about $489 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.951" offset="14375163">If Virginia had gotten all of the sums that was -- that were authorized for fiscal ‘73, ‘74, and ‘75, it would've had slightly more than enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.810" offset="14422601">There would've been slightly more than enough federal money to enable Virginia to meet that ‘77 deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.970" offset="14451231">As it is with the withholding of 55% of the funding for the first two fiscal years, Virginia has gotten $243 million rather than the $489 million in federal money they need just to meet that deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.395" offset="14508910">In other words, even if you take EPA's own estimates of what construction needs are to comply with the statute, it's clear were in trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.271" offset="14548407">I think another specific provision of this statute that is instructed and one that has been addressed to some extent already this afternoon is the contract authority provisions of Title II of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.283" offset="14596472">Those provisions are relevant because when you study the legislative history, it's clear that Congress intended in enacting this advance funding mechanism, to give municipalities and states the opportunity to plan ahead, so that they would know and looking several years now on the road, what federal money they could expect and can plan accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.188" offset="14688110">Now, when the administrator construes his authority under the Act, to mean that he can make an initial allotment in whatever amount he pleases and then can dole out further allotments from time to time, from year to year as he sees fit, I think it's clear that that entirely frustrates that very carefully contrived legislative scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.448" offset="14797197">I think then that when one studies the entire legislative history of this statute, when one looks at the deadlines provisions, when one looks at the contract authority provisions, it becomes clear that Congress must have intended some limitation on the discretion the administrator was being given leave to exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.667" offset="14898030">In other words, I think that these are far more useful tools than merely turning to Representative Harsha in saying that he said we didn't do anything up to that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.798" offset="14942542">I think, it's far more useful and it's indeed in accordance with general rules of statutory construction for this Court to look at the entirety of the statute and ask the question, does it make sense that Congress intended to give the administrator unfettered discretion in light of what that would do to the remainder of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.018" offset="15031463">If the Court has no further questions, I believe, I've concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.102" offset="15047764">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3778.602" offset="15217768">On the question of discretion, which I think is the main question we all agree we have before us, I wish to point -- I did point out, that if the discretion is as broad as the Congressman repeatedly said it was in getting the votes to override the veto, then it would be impossible for a judge to place himself in the position of a President balancing the budget or trying to control inflation and make the choices, but I think it's worth saying something else, I think --</text>

            <text syncTime="3860.269" offset="15544404">And I would point out to you that that former review is also has a spurious attractiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.861" offset="15566764">What the President has the authority to do is to make a cost-benefit analysis under the Anti-deficiency Act or inherently of whether spending more funds this year rather than next would merely inflate the cost of the resources and whether it's worth it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.411" offset="15633011">And that too is a kind of discretion, and I think it would be quite difficult for our Court to review because it's a cost-benefit analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.948" offset="15667179">And the President is saying is 20% more dollars worth 10% more output are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.004" offset="15695391">So, I think that is an executive kind of decision which will be exceedingly difficult to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.324" offset="15720678">But in any case, the deadlines in the Act, it is now quite clear probably cannot be met even if all of this money were spent.</text>
