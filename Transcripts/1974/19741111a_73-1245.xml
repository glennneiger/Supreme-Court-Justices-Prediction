            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="44.673" offset="282102">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.685" offset="294118">This case comes here on the Government's petitioner for a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.447" offset="325151">It arises from the issuance of an internal revenue summons in the course of an investigation by the Internal Revenue Service into a series of unusual currency transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.188" offset="372172">Specifically, the question, a statutory one, is whether the Internal Revenue Service has power to issue a summons in order to discover the identity of a person who maybe liable for unpaid taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.082" offset="431731">The bank involved, where the unusual currency transactions occurred, is the Commercial Bank of Middlesboro, Kentucky of which respondent Bisceglia is a Vice President.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.881" offset="482931">The facts are basically simple and undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.267" offset="500485">In November 1970, the Commercial Bank deposited on two separate occasions, $20,000.00 in $100.00 bills with the Federal Reserve Bank in Cincinnati which was a branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.699" offset="570180">These bills as the testimony characterized them in the District Court were tissue paper thin which suggested a long period of storage, and perhaps in an unusual place.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.653" offset="629948">On the regular Federal Reserve procedures, the matter was reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cincinnati to the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.870" offset="674879">The deposit of such a large amount of cash was unusual in this context and it was especially unusual for the bills to be badly worn.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.152" offset="720018">For example, the testimony developed that during the first 10 months of this year in 1970, the Commercial Bank of Middlesboro had only deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cincinnati, 218 $100.00 bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.624" offset="785847">And here within a two week period in November 1970, it deposited an additional 400 of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.024" offset="815417">This --</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="178.331" offset="816671">Are you implying then that the situation might be different had this been New York City and one of the major banks there?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="184.194" offset="840182">Well, I'm suggesting that in the context of this case, such a large amount of cash was unusual and perhaps I think the Internal Revenue Service might not have been alerted in the context of a large commercial center such as New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.021" offset="903502">But I don't think that the facts, the fact that this case might arise in New York would limit the statutory power of the Internal Revenue Service.</text>

            <text syncTime="213.105" offset="955747">I think there are only 4 -- my impression is there were only 400 $100.00 bills, a total of $40,000.00 but these were the -- this was the --</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="226.413" offset="1009037">Exactly, these were regulations that the Federal Reserve maintained prior to the enactment of the Bank Secrecy Act which the Court considered last term in the California Bankers Association case.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.307" offset="1056580">But the Federal Reserve procedures were to report this to the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.168" offset="1076015">Now from the Internal Revenue Service's point of view, this event suggested that substantial transactions had occurred outside normal financial channels.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.775" offset="1122513">In fact, the Supervisor of the Currency Section of the Federal Reserve Bank in Cincinnati testified that it was his recollection, the only comparable situation where bills were so badly worn is to be tissue paper thin that the sizing of the paper had completely disintegrated, were difficult to count, had occurred in the situation where a cash hoard had been stored in milk cans which in turn had been buried in concrete.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.390" offset="1236929">Now, this kind of situation suggested to the Internal Revenue Service that the recipient of this cash hoard may well have received it in a manner and not pay -- and had not satisfied a tax liability on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.804" offset="1302549">Now the possibilities are numerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.769" offset="1314461">It could be an amount of money that was received and hidden away for which income tax was not paid on.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.399" offset="1344972">It could have been hoard of someone who died and estate taxes may not have been paid upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.313" offset="1372662">It could have been a gift to someone in which case, the donor may not have paid the gift tax on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.473" offset="1393246">Because of these possibilities which are -- we believe reasonable to the Internal Revenue Service, the Internal Revenue Service commenced an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.190" offset="1432116">And in the course of that investigation, it issued the summons to the Commercial Banks of Middlesboro and to Mr. Bisceglia specifically to produce all records in connection with the deposit of this matter that may shed some light on the deposit of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.134" offset="1499930">Now because the tax -- because the identity of the taxpayer was unknown in this instance, the IRS summons was drawn “in the matter of the tax liability of John Doe.”</text>
            <text syncTime="363.211" offset="1556250">But it was fully contemplated that once the identity of John Doe were established to the service to the satisfaction that the service would then commence an order of the taxpayer or the depositor's or transferor's tax returns and inquire as to the means of acquisition of this cash hoard and to determine whether all tax liabilities have been satisfied on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.448" offset="1645171">And the bank refused to comply with the summons, so the United States commenced this action which was on a petition for enforcement of the summons under Section 7604 of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.877" offset="1698879">And the -- after holding --</text>

            <text syncTime="436.268" offset="1848404">The summons asked for two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.791" offset="1858539">It asked for production of records which Mr. Bisceglia I think indisputably had the power to direct the Internal Revenue service to the examination and it also asked the testimony.</text>
