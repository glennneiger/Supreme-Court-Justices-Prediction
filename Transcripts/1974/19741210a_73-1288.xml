            <label>Mr. Victor S. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="44.108" offset="279803">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.288" offset="292551">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which applied the act of state doctrine to hold the petitioner, Alfred Dunhill of London, could not obtain an affirmative judgment against the Republic of Cuba, awarded by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.531" offset="361514">Certiorari was granted by this Court with respect to two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.553" offset="377605">First issue is whether statement of counsel made at the trial can constitute an act of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.308" offset="404564">As to that issue, we contend that there is nothing in the record that in any way evidences, a sovereign act by the Republic of Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.375" offset="436851">All that the record shows in this respect are statements by counsel for the Republic of Cuba indicating a litigating position in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.517" offset="473422">The second issue in which certiorari was granted sua sponte by this Court was whether assuming the act of state doctrine applies in this case, whether the affirmative judgment nevertheless should be reinstated under the counter claim exception set forth in First National City Bank against Banco Nacional de Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.627" offset="545834">As to that issue, we contend that under the totality of the circumstances in this case where Cuba has put into issue in a single proceeding far more than the amount of the counter claims awarded against us -- against it, and where all of the claims and counter claims arise out of serious of related transactions, put into issue by Cuba in our courts that that counter claim exception should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.373" offset="656906">Because of the position taken by respondent's counsel in their brief in this Court, the position being that the record does not justified the phrasing of the questions as granted in the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.033" offset="715525">I think it'd important that the background of this litigation be set forth at some length so that we can understand precisely what is in the record and the significance of the questions as framed by the questions as framed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.777" offset="766516">Litigation arose out of the action in September 1960 of the Republic of Cuba in nationalizing certain cigar factories in Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.031" offset="807476">That action was turned an intervention, a euphemist.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.743" offset="822314">And for that reason, the Cuban Government and its representatives in this case are often referred to as interventors.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.964" offset="851257">The persons whose factories were seized are very often referred to as the owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.558" offset="877589">For a long time prior to the intervention, Dunhill, as well as other importers had purchased cigars from the owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.186" offset="904129">Indeed, for a short period after the intervention, the importers, against including Dunhill continued to purchase cigars from Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.442" offset="937148">And during the immediate post-intervention period continue to make payments for shipments of cigars that had been shipped prior to the intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.023" offset="979466">The owners of course immediately after the intervention fled Cuba; some of them coming here to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.415" offset="1009037">In early 1961, the owner instituted nine actions in the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.342" offset="1028786">Four of them were against Dunhill.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.540" offset="1037563">By these actions, the owners in essence sought to obtain payments for cigar shipped both before and after the intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.543" offset="1069537">Shortly thereafter, the interventors brought their own action, not against the importers but against the owner's counsel in an action entitled Policio against Russian Block.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.904" offset="1106944">By that action, the interventors in essence sought to claim the right to sue for the same matters on which the owners had already institute it suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.477" offset="1157308">Since the importers were essentially in the position of stake holder in these actions, the District Court stay the actions against them and proceeded to resolve the threshold and significant disputes between the owners and the interventors regarding who is entitled to payment of what cigars.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.660" offset="1226062">Insofar as relevant here, the District Court for Judge O'Brien in 1966 and under the decision that was later affirmed per curium by the Second Circuit held that the interventors were entitled to sue for the post-intervention shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.702" offset="1282173">In essence, the court held that at least with respect to Cuban assets under the ruling of this Court in Sabbatino and the act of state doctrine set forth there, the nationalization decree of 1960 was effective as to the seized Cuban assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.279" offset="1336508">At this point in time however, the significant, and we're talking now about 1967, the interventors stipulated before the District Court that the owners were entitled to recover for free intervention shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.504" offset="1389380">The assumption by both the owners and the interventors some seven years after the event being that these amounts were to insignificant to concern themselves with.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.115" offset="1427832">After the rulings in Policio against Russian Block, the interventors were allowed to intervene this time in the procedural sense in the nine actions in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.952" offset="1463150">The actions were in fact consolidated for trial, tried together and appeal together to the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.323" offset="1488645">During the course of trial preparation however and the course of the trial itself, it developed that as of the day of the intervention, there had been almost $500,000.00 in unpaid amounts for cigar shipped prior to the intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.977" offset="1547264">Hardly and insignificance on this had been thought by both the owners and interventors when they entered into their stipulation in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.604" offset="1577775">It further developed during the course of these proceedings that the importers shortly after the intervention had in fact paid all of the sums in accordance with their long standing practice of paying on 30, 60 or 90 days terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.823" offset="1634617">At that point, Cuba of course changed its position and sought to back off from its stipulation that had entered -- it had intervened to in Policio against Russian Block.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.797" offset="1674533">They contended now that they should be entitled to the pre-intervention shipments as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.618" offset="1697834">And not only that, they contended that they never received those payments if in fact they had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.716" offset="1722284">The District Court however found that not only had the payments been made by the importers, but that Cuba in fact had received them.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.596" offset="1757706">In the case of Dunhill, those payments amounted to some $55,000.00 more than the District Court found Dunhill still owed for the post-intervention shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.576" offset="1797726">In the case of the importers as a group however, the situation was reversed because far more was still ode to the interventors by the importers as a group for the post-intervention shipments than the District Court found had been paid to Cuba for the pre-intervention shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.912" offset="1867003">Judge O'Brien ruled that the owners were entitled to payment for the pre-intervention shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.098" offset="1887796">He also ruled that the interventors had received those payments and reliable under an unjust-enrichment theory to return them to the importers.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.766" offset="1922487">In his initial decision, he allowed the importers to set off against what they owed for the post-intervention shipments the amounts that they had paid for the pre-intervention shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.562" offset="1961671">He specifically ruled the act of state doctrine inapplicable to the payments received by Cuba, stating in part, and I'm quoting this portion of an opinion now.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.764" offset="1998451">“Here, all that occurred was a statement by counsel for the interventors during trial that the Cuban Government and the interventors denied liability and had refused to make repayment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="484.280" offset="2040456">This statement was made after the interventors had invoked the jurisdiction of this Court in order to pursue their claims against the importers for post-intervention shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.114" offset="2075878">It is hard to conceive how if such a statement can be elevated to the status of an act of state any refusal by any state to honor any obligation at any time could be considered anything else, should note panthetically at this point that it was apparent that the set off procedure described by Judge O'Brien in his initial opinion obviously did not take account of Dunhill's situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.130" offset="2175875">Accordingly after the decision was rendered, we move for an affirmative judgment against the interventors.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.478" offset="2201266">Despite the claim and trial of an act of state, the interventors expressed no opposition to this and there being no opposition, that motion was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.085" offset="2243688">The Second Circuit of course affirmed Judge O'Brien's decision in all respects except one.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.451" offset="2261138">It reversed the affirmative judgment in favor of Dunhill on the ground of the act of state doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.456" offset="2281200">It found the act of state in Cuba's failure to honor the importer's demand for return of the payments, and I'm quoting now, “confirmed by the Cuban Government's counsel at trial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="556.471" offset="2329266">In short, regardless of what the Court of Appeals language was, there is no question that on the record, the only conceivable evidence of any act of state by the Cuban Government was simply the statements by counsel for the Cuban Government that its client would not honor a claim for return of the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.605" offset="2417768">The effect of the Court of Appeals ruling of course is to force Dunhill to pay twice for the same cigars, having already paid the interventors. Under the court's ruling, they must now pay the owners with interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.079" offset="2467715">We submit therefore that despite the statements in respondent's brief to the contrary, the first issue is properly before this Court that is whether statements of counsel can constitute an act of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.901" offset="2522990">And we submit as well that for the reason's set forth in our brief that they cannot.</text>

            <text syncTime="664.029" offset="2759450">I think we must recognize that in all other instances were Cuba has been before this or any other court, they have appeared armed with a decree which states certain consequences, usually confiscation of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.751" offset="2822353">We have a situation in this case however were up until that last year, not only has Cuba certainly not issued any decree with respect to these funds, but is been actively contending in our courts that they never receive them.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.627" offset="2877837">Now, it seems to me that it is a far crime from stating that we have funds and we hereby seize them to say in the other instance that we are coming into your courts to try to collect those funds, and then when the proof come out that they already had them to deny received of the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.882" offset="2946905">That is not a seizure and I would respectfully suggest that the situation is far different and that there is a real debt, yes sir.</text>

            <text syncTime="719.625" offset="2981909">The Second Circuit as I read the opinion found an act of state in view of all of the circumstances and said that a form of declaration was not necessary, and you differ from that?</text>

            <text syncTime="734.190" offset="3040110">Clearly, there are circumstances where some act, some public sovereign act of the state maybe proved by other than a formal decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.598" offset="3077726">There are a number of cases, most of them occur in time of civil strife or rebellion where a military officer for example goes in and seizes property.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.943" offset="3115133">That is not a formal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.482" offset="3121298">But every case which has decided the act of state doctrine has insisted that there be some public affirmative act, something that one can look at and say “this is the affirmative act of the sovereign”, something with a sovereigness acting so that if this Court or any court in this country where to take a contrary position, it could be considered in a front to the sovereignty of that nation.</text>

            <text syncTime="826.304" offset="3408541">Respondents appear to concede in their brief and I'm not sure it's a concession, but they do appear to concede that statements of counsel in fact cannot constitute an act of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.188" offset="3448142">I refer the Court to page 12 of respondent's brief in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.320" offset="3472697">They seek to avoid the issue by in affect asserting that counsel was simply the agency by which Cuba made known its legal position.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.715" offset="3510209">We suggest that this simply does not square with the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.121" offset="3523897">As I have said, every case which has does far considered the application of this doctrine has insisted that there be some affirmative act of the foreign sovereign as the Chief Justice says pointed out within it's own territory, and then as a second requirement that there be confident proof of the existence of that act within our courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.710" offset="3602160">Here, for all that counsel has said, we still do not know what the act was.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.170" offset="3620028">We do not know when it took place or how it took place or who is responsible for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.852" offset="3642807">In this connection, we've cited the case of the Navemar which all be the case dealing with sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.151" offset="3667989">I think his instructive in terms of the standards of at least minimal proof required when a sovereign comes into our courts and asserts a claim that it should be treated differently from private litigates.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.044" offset="3715532">In the Navemar, there was a verified statement by the Ambassador of Spain that his Government had in fact seized possession and ownership of a libel vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.184" offset="3756074">There being some question about those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.280" offset="3764537">The court refused to foreclose these issues, but instead, invited the ambassador to intervene in the action and prosecute his claims as a litigant in the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.562" offset="3805602">Suggest moreover that in addition to the fact that the act of state application here was far broader than in any of the decided cases, that there are no policy reasons underlying the act of state doctrine which would require any less proof than we are contending for.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.441" offset="3877177">The doctrine itself as the respondents concede of necessity works in unfairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.177" offset="3900061">As to any litigant against whom the doctrine is applied, it denies him his judicial remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.566" offset="3925661">True, if the courts are attempting to deal with a public act or pronouncement of a foreign Government, certainly, they're maybe a realistic danger that the courts either maybe involved in political controversy in international affairs were may be usurping executive prerogatives in those affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.162" offset="4000057">But surely, we're -- there is no public act of a foreign sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.925" offset="4023045">We submit that those dangers are unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.961" offset="4035166">And that to apply the doctrine, to create the unfairness, unless there is a realistic basis in fact on which the courts can operate, simply does not make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.191" offset="4084172">And we submit that that requires nothing less than competent evidence at the trial that an affirmative act of a foreign sovereign has in fact occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.938" offset="4119176">And here as we know nothing of a sort has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.936" offset="4131088">I reviewed the history of the case at some length because I wanted to show that for some 10 years, Cuba apparently was either unaware or at the very least disputed the receipt of the varying monies, counsel for Cuba and assets, it has seized at sometime that we don't know and in some manner which we also don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.416" offset="4233070">There is a suggestion to respondent's brief that I feel should be discussed briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.270" offset="4256475">At page 17, respondents appeared to argue that the nationalization decree of 1960 might be the act of state which justifies the retention of petitioner's payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.795" offset="4314572">The argument appears to be that since that decree nationalized, the accounts receivable of the owners that payments on those accounts, at least in so far as they reach Cuba may also have been taken under the authority of that decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.995" offset="4375385">Both courts below and of course held under the Republic of Iraq case that the decree was in effective to reach those accounts receivable because they were assets located outside of the jurisdiction of Cuba being payable in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.222" offset="4436302">We believe that ruling was correct, but we do want to point out that if this is respondent's position now and if that word to be adopted, we must note that to the extent that the court rule in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.741" offset="4494294">The rulings of the courts below with respect to parties not now before it would also be affected because if the court were to rule that the decree somehow operated with respect to the accounts receivable insofar as payments on those accounts reach Cuba, then we would submit that the -- that such a ruling would then effect extinguished the accounts receivable themselves, and the owner's judgments against Dunhill to that effect would also be extinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.968" offset="4623235">I turn now to the second argument, one of the second branch of the argument which assumes that the court finds -- that the act of state doctrine is effective here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.538" offset="4677569">And the question is assuming that effect is this case within the counter claim exception created by City Bank in view of the fact that petitioners counter claim here does not exceed the net balance owed to Cuba by all of the other importers who are consolidated for trial in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.211" offset="4764191">We submit that in view of the totality of circumstances of this case that the counter claim exception should in fact be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.251" offset="4792404">In fact, we believe that the circumstances here are far stronger for justifying the application of that doctrine than they were in City Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.006" offset="4835349">In City Bank, of course, they were many differences of views among the different justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.519" offset="4861471">But we think that two-threads run through the various opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.444" offset="4877145">I've have already alluded to them in my argument on the first point, they are that the act of state doctrine really serves two fundamental purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.585" offset="4913716">One is involved with not having this Court enter into areas which are more properly reserved for the executive, the other is that this Court should not be involve in deciding issues with may affect our foreign relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.462" offset="4969200">I do not and I'm thankful, I do not for purposes of this case have to get into the question as to which of those is the more important because I think under either view, it is quite clear that allowing the counter claim here to the extent of all of the judgments in favor of Cuba would not violate either of those principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.411" offset="5049031">We must recall that this case like any other that we have found involves Cuba's coming into our courts and affirmatively seeking relief on the questions of who was entitled to the payment of all of the cigars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.067" offset="5107649">Initially, they came in and asked for payments of all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.500" offset="5117367">They then retreated when they found that they were significant amounts due on the post-intervention ship -- for the pre-intervention shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.437" offset="5145161">They went back and again, sued for all of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.470" offset="5157282">The only thing that happened after that was that having as the courts, as the evidence manted and as it became clear that they might loose on some of those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.273" offset="5196466">They retreated into an act of state defense to the assertion of a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.982" offset="5215274">Cuba has never in this case said that anything they have done with respect to those accounts receivable and the amounts payable on the cigars should not be treated by this Courts as a judicial issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.970" offset="5267205">In fact, Cuba has submitted these very issues to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.813" offset="5282670">The only reason the act of state doctrine has been asserted here is because on some of those issues, Cuba seemed to being coming out a loser.</text>

            <text syncTime="1443.964" offset="5879202">I would conclude simply by saying that we have cited in our brief a number of instances where both the executive and legislative trends, it seems to us or distinctly going toward looking at this favor with any expansion of view the act of state doctrine where the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1584.125" offset="6439894">My point simply is that Cuba has put into issue in a single litigating mode all these claims and counter claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.901" offset="6478973">And what I'm suggesting is that the rational for allowing a complete set off or counter claim within this framework, regardless of the precise form that it took is far stronger than was present in City Bank.</text>

            <text syncTime="1731.518" offset="7029426">I would like to start off if I may with this discussion that Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Rehnquist had been having because I suggested in filing my brief here that this petition for certiorari was improvidently granted and should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.594" offset="7093791">Then one of the reasons that I urge was that no judgment can be collected here, collected that can perhaps be obtain if the petition to wins, but no judgment can be collected here under any foreseeable circumstances, and therefore this case, well I'm not moot in the constitutional sense, that is a risk of a case of controversy under Article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.729" offset="7174248">Nevertheless, it is for all practical purposes pointless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.591" offset="7189713">And it is pointless because all Cuban assets are frozen, and the Treasury Department which has the task of licensing the expenditure of funds out of frozen funds has indicated already as we knew all along it would that it will not license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.657" offset="7281977">The execution of any Dunhill excess judgment against assets which are of a wise frozen whether it be a bank account as Mr. Justice White suggest or one of the other judgments that has been obtained as against Faver, Coe as Mr. Friedman suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.464" offset="7361181">Therefore, we have a situation which is akin shall we say to an action in which plaintiff is suing a person who is concededly and obviously insolvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.452" offset="7417187">The total number of claims filed against Cuban assets in the United States amounts to $1,799,000,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.722" offset="7470268">Now, I don't know the amount of frozen funds are, but if they amount to a few million dollars, it's a lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.398" offset="7492942">If this $53,000.00 judgment is collected from those funds and I don't believe it can be, but if it is collected from those funds, we have pennies depending on the outcome of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.714" offset="7550203">And I don't believe it can be because the procedure that is followed in all of these cases and that has been followed in the Cuba case is to require a debted to file a claim with the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, and not to bring the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.098" offset="7619793">Dunhill chose to bring a lawsuit instead of filing a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.514" offset="7633377">Now, I suppose it has the right to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.699" offset="7646124">But if passed precedent in handling these cases is any guide to what the future may bring, and of course, I have no crystal ball, but I can read what has happened, there is no possibility of even this $53,000.00 sharing in that $1 billion, excuse me, $1,000,800,000.00 claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.105" offset="7735777">So, this whole discussion, although it involved very interesting questions of law, so far as return to Dunhill is concern is going to end in zero when I cannot understand any justification for Dunhill spending all his time and I of course why the court granted the petition for cert is not my business, but at least I suggest that perhaps that question might be reviewed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2007.976" offset="8135241">Hence, it refuses to return the money and it is retained to counsel to plead its right to those funds and that's what counsel has been doing to the best of its ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.446" offset="8181112">Now, that claim is not a frivolous or capricious or an arbitrary claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.411" offset="8205040">It is based as Mr. Friedman was kind enough to state on a nationalization decree, a decree which was adopted on September 17, 1960 and which purported to nationalize all of the assets of Cuban, not American but Cuban concerns about manufactured tobaccos, cigars in Havana, and to nationalize not only the physical property in Cuba, but also the accounts receivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.973" offset="8331264">The question as to whether this nationalization decree extended to the accounts receivable was litigated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2079.929" offset="8423111">And the issue there involves or revolves around this rather metaphysical question, what is the situs of the debt?</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.686" offset="8458115">If the situs of the debt was in Havana, then, it was nationalized.</text>

            <text syncTime="3702.377" offset="14912867">I would just like to respond to a few remarks made by counsel for respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.017" offset="14935437">I turn first to the question again of what is the act of state in this case, and Mr. Rabinowitz is indicated that it may proceed from one of two standpoints, and I'm still confused is to where we really look to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.252" offset="14988413">I simply want to point out again however that if it is the decree, I do not believe that this Court can rule with respect to that issue on this petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.504" offset="15029373">That is something that has not been raised by the respondent's previous to this time, and I respectfully suggest that that would affect rights of other parties to this action that where are not now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.673" offset="15074095">If on the other hand, we are still dealing with the question of the possible seizure or retention of assets independently of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.182" offset="15108054">I would suggest again that the remarks in our brief are fully applicable, and that is there has been no proof whatsoever that any sovereign act on the part of Cuba in any form that is acceptable as evidence in our courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.541" offset="15165524">I'd like to turn now to the questions that our counsel has raised with respect to the enforceability of this judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.858" offset="15194781">I do not pretend for a minute that I will soon be a simple matter of simply going into court and enforcing this judgment the way one would and the other civil judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.989" offset="15235323">I do not agree with counsel for respondents that this is a worthless piece of paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.809" offset="15254653">There are a number of possible ways the judgment might be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.065" offset="15267610">I do not believe that this Court need consider how likely those possibilities are or just exactly what our chances will be to obtain a recovery under the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.136" offset="15315884">The fact of the matter is that there are possibilities and we should be entitled to pursue them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3859.691" offset="15542105">There's no way that Dunhill can recover a single penny here that goes into Dunhill's pockets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.807" offset="15566555">That really raises another issue that was alluded to by counsel for respondents, and that is the question of why didn't Dunhill file a claim?</text>
            <text syncTime="3876.190" offset="15608142">The simple answer is here, that Dunhill was never seeking anything from anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.525" offset="15625488">The only reason that Dunhill is in the position that is in now is because of the conflicting claims that were asserted against it by both the owners and the interventors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.520" offset="15661432">Dunhill, as well as the other importers always considering themselves in the position of stakeholder, and along that same lines, I would suggest that the cut-off date, which was allude to for filing of claims, we do not think as it all applicable here for at least two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.834" offset="15730709">First, that refers to expropriations of property.</text>

            <text syncTime="3988.202" offset="16056195">So far as I know, I don't believe that the importers had any connection with these cases, except to be named as defendants by the owners until 1967 -- or 1966 I guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="4001.286" offset="16108544">I would just make one other point with respect to the question of a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.769" offset="16134457">Counsel has stated that the office of foreign assets control has said in no one certain terms that a license will not be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.355" offset="16160789">I think if the Court will look at the appendix to respondent's brief which contains the exchange of correspondents between the respondents and that office it will find that that is not the position of that office.</text>
            <text syncTime="4025.641" offset="16205928">They had set forth a general policy, but that does not say that that is their final position or if it is, then, it would not be subject to review in the courts, or that it might not be influenced by a ruling by this Court in this proceeding.</text>
