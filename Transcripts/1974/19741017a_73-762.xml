            <text syncTime="194.390" offset="880933">Such as in Iowa, we have requirement of reconciliation, the injunctions that would be necessary or proper to preserve the peace or property and these things we feel are the real issue and that the citizen has in the divorce court, the non-resident or a resident domiciliary of the State who cannot overcome the jurisdictional one year requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.706" offset="978213">He cannot have for instance a -- the severance of the relationship which is possible to a non-resident who moves in with his spouse and then the other spouse would for instance move out after the action has been commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.554" offset="1033592">If there is a severe reason for an immediate severance, we don't have to wait the 90 days that are normally required for divorce but if it was a one party was from out of the state, it had wait a full year and 90 days possibly or at least a year before they get an access to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.021" offset="1095450">The custody of the offspring and I feel this is very important and why many times access to the court is quite urgent because of the fact that the ramifications of the separate families if we don't make the ties cutoff that the ramifications and the effect upon children and the offspring of the marriage can be affected to a great extent and that therefore you should be able to get in at least as far as the parties are concerned and that the custody questions can be litigated so you don't have this situation, the parties running from state to state with children trying to get the other state to give them custody that we could get this matters litigated and that the offspring could be better protected if they let a chance to get to the court and the support of those persons, the division of the properties so that there could be certain injunctory orders entered to preserve the status quo so that disposition of the properties that the parties that they're leaving in another state, don't dispose of the properties or do something with them so that when it comes time to take care of the offspring that there are things available.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.682" offset="1354062">For instance, there are statute to counseling, there's no counseling.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.802" offset="1366601">The State of Iowa has maintained that one of the purposes of the one year residency requirement is this got somehow going to preserve the union that we feel that however immediate access to the courts would allow the order for some type of word of counseling which may be more beneficial than having two parties in opposite -- in separate state sitting and wondering about their situation for a year.</text>
