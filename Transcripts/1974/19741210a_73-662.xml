            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear arguments first this morning in number 73-662, Schlesinger against Councilman.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="13.524" offset="157445">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.965" offset="167267">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.158" offset="183986">The respondent, Captain Councilman is under Court-Martial charges for violating Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the General Article, by wrongfully selling, transferring, and possessing marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.759" offset="238425">At the time of the offense, Captain Councilman was off post, off duty, and out of uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.733" offset="262353">Although stationed at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, he was then in his apartment in Langley, Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.486" offset="285341">The sale and transfer of marijuana were to a man who Councilman believed to be an enlisted man also not in uniform and off duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.706" offset="322226">He believed him to be a clerk typist at Fort Sill.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.431" offset="333093">He was, in fact, an enlisted undercover agent for the Army's Criminal Investigation Detachment which was investigating a report that the Captain used marijuana at his apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.852" offset="378755">Councilman moved to dismiss the charges against him on the ground that the Court-Martial lacked jurisdiction because the crimes were not service-connected under O'Callahan against Parker.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.744" offset="422327">The presiding military judge denied that motion and Councilman then brought this action to the District Court which, on the grounds of absence of service-connection, permanently enjoined the military authorities from proceeding with the Court-Martial and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.518" offset="489409">This case put in play two important issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.310" offset="500590">The first is the propriety of the District Court's intervention in a pending Court-Martial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.665" offset="518040">The second is the rationale and application of the service-connection test for Court-Martial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.860" offset="546774">These are both issues of serious concern to the government for they bear directly upon the effectiveness of the Armed Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.260" offset="572374">We submit, in the first place, that the District Court should not have interfered with this Court-Martial and the reasons for that conclusion are interrelated.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.751" offset="602363">They are the doctrines we discussed yesterday of comedy and exhaustion of remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.336" offset="624724">We've also contended that the finality provision of the Uniform Code of Military Justice Article 76 precludes review by any mode other than a petition for habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.534" offset="673520">Our arguments yesterday in McLucas against De'Champlain dealt with the principles of exhaustion and comedy-- exhaustion of remedies and comedy and here, as there, we rely upon Younger against Harris and Gusik against Schilder.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.297" offset="728586">The military justice system is a coordinate judicial system with a series of appellate stages through which any conviction must be tested and strained.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.827" offset="762650">The ordinary considerations of avoiding duplication, waste of judicial resources, and so forth apply here as they did in Younger and in Gusik.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="173.678" offset="798072">Is your argument on this branch of the case identical to the arguments you made?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="178.532" offset="817507">Virtually so, Mr. Justice Stewart, except for one point and that is that I wish to distinguish the line of cases Billings against Truesdale and Toth against Quarles and so forth because of the nature of the trial that is required on a service-connection issue and I will just-- I will not repeat the argument about Younger against Harris or Gusik against Schilder in the ordinary consideration.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="206.317" offset="928684">That is the nature of a trial required on the service-connection issue.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="209.249" stopTime="215.264">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="209.249" offset="940387">Or at least something additional you need to say in view of those cases, is that it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="215.264" stopTime="216.799">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="215.264" offset="964420">Yes.</text>

            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="216.799" offset="970585">But isn't there a difference that, here, the claim is that they can't try him at all?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="220.793" stopTime="315.082">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="220.793" offset="986572">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.278" offset="992528">That is why I wish to say that it is semantically possible, Mr. Justice Marshall, to make this case sound as if it were similar to Toth against Quarles or Reid against Covert or that line of cases, because it can be put in terms that the question is the military's power to try the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.373" offset="1068910">But, I think it's quite different from those cases because in those cases the military's lack of power to try the man comes from his status and not from his conduct, and it's a quite simple trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.327" offset="1116662">In fact, it's solely a legal issue whether the man is a civilian or a military man, whether, if he is a civilian, the military has a constitutional power to try him.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.830" offset="1154696">Here, however, the question of the power to try him and it's quite different, I think, when a man is not a civilian but is a military man who is ordinarily subject to military discipline and military jurisdiction and, in addition, when the claim that he may not be tried rests upon the factual details of what he did and where he did it and so forth, because that means that when a service-connection issue is raised, if he can go into a Federal District Court, in many cases, there should be a small trial of the crime to get out the details.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.454" offset="1297220">In fact, I think in this case it may be that this stipulation is seriously inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.659" offset="1318013">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.504" offset="1325432">If District Courts are going to come into these cases, I will advice you as attorneys and military lawyers to make much fuller records than this so we can find out about service-connection much more effectively.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="315.082" stopTime="324.636">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="315.082" offset="1363675">Do you consider it a particular importance that this was a transaction between a captain and an enlisted man who is under his command?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="324.636" stopTime="333.444">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="324.636" offset="1401919">I consider that of crucial importance on the service-connection issue, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.181" offset="1420100">On the jurisdictional issue, however, I don't think that it's-- it bears this directly.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="333.444" stopTime="336.852">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="333.444" offset="1437132">Even though they were off base and out of uniform?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="336.852" stopTime="605.452">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="336.852" offset="1450820">Well, I-- by the jurisdictional issue, I meant initially whether a District Court ought ever to entertain a claim like this before the military process has run its course and I think, on a service-connection issue, it ought not.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.920" offset="1511006">On-- I think it's clear that it is a service-connected and I will argue to that effect in a moment, but I wish to complete the answer to Mr. Justice Marshall's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.163" offset="1552071">If you may go into a Civilian Court in advance of a Court-Martial, the Civilian Court in many cases will have to hear the facts of the crime to determine the service-connection issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.035" offset="1603480">If the Civilian Court determines it is service-connected, you will then go back for a full military trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.493" offset="1625318">So, you'll have two trials: one civilian and one military.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.837" offset="1638693">If the Civilian Court determines it is not service-connected, you will then have two civilian trials: one on the injunctive action and one presumably when the local prosecutor brings a charge under the criminal law, the civilian criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.380" offset="1704939">So, I think there's quite a waste of resources in this kind of a service-connection case which is necessarily a factual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.007" offset="1731375">If you have it proceed to the military, then you need have only one trial of the fact and a Court looking at habeas corpus later on the service-connection issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.869" offset="1770872">They rely on the military record.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.750" offset="1782366">In addition to that, there is in the service-connection issue necessarily an expert judgment about the effect of the behavior upon the discipline, the morale, the effectiveness of the Armed Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.162" offset="1844015">And, I think that judgment initially should be made and illuminated by military tribunals with the expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.227" offset="1876302">It may then be reviewed on habeas corpus by a Civilian Court with the issues so-illuminated, and I think that is why this case is a very different kind of a case, both in terms of expertise and in terms of trial of factual matters than the Toth v. Quarles or Billings against Truesdale line of cases, and why the Doctrine of Exhaustion of Remedies and Comedy is particularly appropriate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.281" offset="1996466">Now, Mr. Chief Justice, you mentioned the issue raised in this case by the fact that the marijuana sale and transfer charges involve the sale and transfer of marijuana by an officer, Captain Councilman, to a man whom he knew to be an enlisted man and the enlisted man he knew understood him to be an officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.665" offset="2094059">And, I think that makes the first two charges in this case quite clearly service-connected.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.369" offset="2140871">O'Callahan and Parker and Relford against Commandant were cases which explicate a number of the criteria that are relevant in judging service-connection, but the Relford opinion explicitly recognizes that those factors are not a closed set.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.242" offset="2204296">That's not a codification that, further, is a common law development in this c-- in this field, and I think the O'Callahan case indicates the rationale which guides that common law development of these cases and it grows out of Congress' constitutional power which exists because the exigencies of military discipline require the existence of special Courts with special expertise and special jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.378" offset="2320906">So, I think, the offense is service-connected when it bears upon discipline, morale, and the effectiveness of the Armed Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.214" offset="2352253">And, when the Armed Forces have a reason of their own, which is distinct from that held in common with civilian society, to be seriously concerned about the offense, and that's certainly true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.978" offset="2407320">The rationale of service-connection indeed, I think, is very similar to the rationale of Article 134 under which Captain Councilman is charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.516" offset="2441488">Article 134 prohibits all disorders and neglect to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the Armed Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.416" offset="2473044">So, both issues, the jurisdictional and the substantive, the service-connection and disorders and neglects are given meaning by the unique nature of the special needs and the vital mission of the military.</text>

            <text syncTime="605.452" offset="2525184">In speaking of the differences between this kind of an offense in military society contrasted to what it would be in civilian society, are you concentrating on the military's attitude toward the possession and use of marijuana or are you concentrating on the-- emphasizing on the traditions in the military that officers and enlisted men do not fraternize?</text>

            <text syncTime="667.222" offset="2772302">I think the service-connection become particularly apparent when the shared behavior is criminal behavior and known to be such by both participants because I think that is particularly destructive to morale and, as word of it spreads around as it will, when an officer engages in this kind of behavior, destructive to the authority of all officers in that commander, indeed, if another commanders hear about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.435" offset="2873135">But, I intend to address as well the fact that possession of marijuana, irrespective of the relationship to the enlisted man, is also service-connected.</text>

            <text syncTime="715.896" offset="2966967">We have just discussed that it's hardly relevant to the destructive impact of shared criminal behavior between an officer and an enlisted man whether it takes place on post or off post, or in or out of uniform, or on or off duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.049" offset="3035617">The relationship between those men is effectively destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.736" offset="3050350">As word gets back in this closed society, which the military is quite a close in its society, a society in which has a great deal of gossip and rumor, it will undercut the authority of all officers in that command.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.292" offset="3116492">And, I think one need not strain one's imagination to think of a variety of criminal offenses that are wholly destructive of the relationship the Armed Forces must require.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.616" offset="3153795">In fact, there may be such offenses which are criminal under the Uniform Code which are not criminal under a State Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.037" offset="3191515">So that if it occurs in certain jurisdictions, civilian authorities will be without power to prosecute but the military, nevertheless, has a vital interest in seeing that that kind of behavior does not take place between officers and enlisted men.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.802" offset="3254627">And, I think that much can hardly be denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1581.528" offset="6429445">I think that myself and the Court has granted split argument in this case, myself and Mr. Meyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.808" offset="6458598">He will address himself to the issue of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.172" offset="6468106">I will attempt to address myself to the issue of service-connection as applied to O'Callahan and Relford, the related cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.702" offset="6502170">I think that the Solicitor General has maybe overstated this case to one extent, in that we will soon have, through the use of military agents, the servicemen of factoring jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.179" offset="6552116">And, as Justice Blackmun has pointed out, we now have a situation where the Courts of Military Appeals chains have uniformly held that possession is per se service-connected, and I would suggest that I don't believe that that was the holding of either Relford or O'Callahan wherein the individual rights seem to be at stake at O'Callahan where we had the flagrant use of the military's deciding jurisdiction was available, where the only thing was that he was a member of the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.133" offset="6691924">There was no other service-connection in an attempted raid off post, out duty, out of uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.552" offset="6713553">The Relford case, I think, tried to limit or at least explain some of the factors that the military should look at in determining whether or not service-connection lied, and I think that we find that the military has, just by some means, has determined that marijuana is per se service-connected with-- if you apply any of the factors set out either in O'Callahan or in Relford, you reach a different conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.348" offset="6856808">The only factor that the Relford decision would point to service-connection would be, in this case, the Councilman case, would be that of a victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.470" offset="6897246">And, I might suggest that, in this case, I'm not sure that victim was the kind of victim that O'Callahan spoke of and that Relford may have expressed itself to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.975" offset="6935280">That is to say, this victim is not engaged in any military activity or duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.429" offset="6953044">This victim is an undercover agent who was holding himself out by the use of an alias and, in the facts in this thing, Councilman was provided to a party for the very purpose of having met this undercover agent and was held out to be not an undercover agent, but as a clerk typist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.666" offset="7037994">Now, we would then have a-- I think, the Army, stretching this thing, if they stretch it much further to the point that they have reached the fact that if a government instrumentality used, then they may decide this is jurisdiction and I know that the Military Courts of Appeals have uniformly held that it is service-connection, and I could only suggest that after the Army has all the facts before it, as It did in this case by virtue of a 32 hearing which is a hearing prior to the 39 (a) hearing where the evidence is a induced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.701" offset="7190131">Then, at the 39 (a) hearing, the government called witnesses and more evidence was induced and, although the facts in this case are very limited because they were reached by stipulation, they're the entire facts and there will never be any change in the structural circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.885" offset="7254915">The government called witnesses of 39 (a) and if they were present at the hearing before the District Judge and if there were to be additional facts that would be presented, I would suggest they certainly would have called witness before the district judge or would have cause be entered into another stipulation as they did in this instance and as attached to the brief in this matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1918.209" offset="7776214">Those items seem to me to be important in this case and that is to say that public drunkenness is a crime conjurable in the military and in the Civilian Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.379" offset="7824906">And, yet, we do not see soldiers that become drunk in the civilian communities dragged into the military system and Court-Martial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2948.514" offset="11897396">Gusik, I believe, is a case that you're referring to, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in which the person charged was in the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.224" offset="11936266">He had already gone through several trials for murder, and he brought the action to this Court asking for habeas corpus and, at that time, a new type of relief was passed by statute I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.618" offset="11993840">This Court required him to then go back and exhaust all of those remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.675" offset="12010036">I think, properly so because, applying the two-step inquiry, one, the person was subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice and, two, the offenses he committed, murder of another serviceman in the service, certainly would satisfy the service-connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.284" offset="12076492">So, on both points of the two-step inquiry, it points toward military jurisdiction and I think, in that situation, a man should be required to exhaust all of his military remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.628" offset="12121840">This was basically the same situation in Noyd versus Bond in which an officer refused orders to teach pilots or train pilots for duty in Vietnam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.163" offset="12168025">If you're applying the two-step inquiry, we find a captain in the Army on active duty subject to the Uniform Code refusing an order, certainly a service-connected offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.502" offset="12205432">The Court properly held then that the man should be required to exhaust his in-military remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.682" offset="12238137">The Court also pointed out that in Noyd versus Bond there was a particular question as to a technical interpretation of a language in the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.341" offset="12284740">In a footnote in Noyd versus Bond, this Court cited Toth, Reid, and McElroy, the cases I've just discussed, pointing out that this Court had vindicated the claim of individuals without requiring the exhaustion of military remedies for the reason that this Court did not believe that the expertise of the military extended to the consideration of the types of constitutional claims there presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.592" offset="12393723">And, moreover, it appeared especially unfair to require exhaustion of military remedies where the complainants raised substantial arguments denying the right of the military to try them at all, and I believe that's where we are here today as well.</text>
