            <text syncTime="45.124" offset="283878">The case before you today is in behalf for the taxpayer Ivan Allen Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.944" offset="303104">This is a penalty tax case is that referred to you also is an accumulated earnings tax case had arises under Section 531, 537 Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.771" offset="350438">If the Court would permit, I might in one very brief moment spelled out the particular provision of 533 which is of issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.220" offset="400280">The very Section 533 portion which is particularly pertinent to the consideration says this, "The fact that the earnings and profits of a corporation are permitted to accumulate beyond the reasonable needs of the business shall be determinative of the purpose to avoid the income tax with respect to shareholders."</text>
            <text syncTime="95.924" offset="487111">I might state briefly that Ivan Allen Company is involved in this case by reason of the purchase of Xerox stock in 19 -- for the years 1965-1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.181" offset="540087">The issue here is whether or not Ivan Allen Company accumulated earnings beyond a reasonable needs of the business that we -- to their earnings and profits succeed are reasonable business needs for those years.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.692" offset="594108">The issue has been framed by stipulation to present a relatively simple issue insofar as the business figures of the corporation are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.844" offset="642800">The amount of Xerox stock, which we claim and did so claim successfully in the District Court, which was purchased from earnings, the accumulated earnings was $154,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.153" offset="692015">That is the amount of investment which we have in liquid assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.980" offset="711241">That amount was reflected in the year 1965 as $154,000.00 and the year 1966 a taxable year in June of 30th that was reflected as $135,000.00 because some of that Xerox stocks have been sold in the year 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.633" offset="785951">The question here before this Court and it's whether or not the earnings and profits in determining this question whether the earnings and profits exceed the reasonable business needs of the business are reasonable needs to be compared with the earnings and profits reflected in the liquid asset as we contend at cost or as the Government says, as total resources available including unrealized appreciation as the government contends.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.410" offset="900995">The Xerox stock web from a basic cost of $154,000.00 in the year for the taxable year of 1965 to $1,640,000.00 rough years, and the year of 1966 as the records will show that same stock at that time $135,000.00 had a liquidation of market value less cost of your -- well, market value of that time of $2,500,000.00.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.591" offset="1109765">They lost that franchise, they saw that Xerox on the market.</text>

            <text syncTime="296.931" offset="1291055">As a matter of fact, this case would not be here today if Ivan Allen Company had just wanted to be safe and just leave the $154,000.00 in cash because it is stipulated by the Government that -- we so state that the cost to our investment as it is invested -- cost of our earnings that which is the investment of Xerox and liquid assets is available to meet reasonable business needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.130" offset="1399933">We say that the appreciation is not available that these are not earnings and that the amount earning so we paid tax of $154,000.00 which went into -- which are accumulated earnings had we left and I don't think the Government will contend otherwise, had we left that $154,000.00 just in cash have management which was hesitant to make decisions, hesitant to looked around and see what was a good investment for some temporary money while they are waiting to use as his operating capital, and this was and stipulated as to cost it was operating capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.031" offset="1539532">Have they left that $154,000.00 in cash as operating capital, there would be no claim because it is stipulated in this case that the amount of all reasonable business needs as an operated in capital $1,000,002.00 in 1965 and $1,000,004 in 1966 would equaled exactly the accumulated earnings for the years -- the same years of 1965 and 1966 if the stock is treated as we respectfully submit in earnings that the investment that they had in liquid assets that would be $1,000,002.00 which will be the accumulated earnings, and $1,000,004.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.895" offset="1694908">So you see, we are saying that $154,000.00 and respectfully $135,000.00 of those two years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1667.002" offset="6771336">The Government determines when you sell your stock and on that very day, you loss up to 37.5% in your value which is not available to meet, then you get a cost deduction and if it's treating you at market and then your stockholder has to pay the full value when he gets it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1731.888" offset="7030888">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.277" offset="7040502">I'd like to start at the outset and try to put in focus our understanding of these statutes that we have before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.169" offset="7076028">The basic purpose of course is to avoid the so-called "incorporated pocket book."</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.858" offset="7098807">Congress determined that stockholder should not be permitted to accumulate idle funds in a corporation in order to avoid dividend taxes that they would otherwise have to pay themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.172" offset="7148022">As we look at the statute, there is a two fold test here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.634" offset="7165889">The first, Section 531 imposes the tax on the accumulated taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.694" offset="7194102">This is an additional tax on income for a given taxable year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.227" offset="7216253">It applies only to that income which is permitted to accumulate in that particular year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.425" offset="7249063">The income involved is determined basically from the books of the corporation and it is determined in much the same way as your regular corporate income is determined but then modified for certain adjustments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.563" offset="7301622">And so far as we see it, this is simple book keeping, you come up with income that's determined the way everyone understands it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.030" offset="7335476">If you have no income, you have no problem under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.078" offset="7359718">If income does exist though, when you've done this computing and it is not distributed as dividends to the stockholders, then you look to see if this income can be distributed without a hardship to the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.090" offset="7423770">The statute speaks of the earnings and profits being permitted to accumulate beyond the reasonable needs of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.767" offset="7458461">And I think the word "needs" here is the keyword for our second test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.587" offset="7485733">It seems to us that this isn't economic test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.881" offset="7498898">Here, the statute departs from concepts of taxable income that we know under bookkeeping and it requires us to measure the resources of the corporation against its needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.618" offset="7553860">The case is construing the statute refer to this as "net liquid assets."</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.929" offset="7579042">If you take your current assets and your current liabilities and you see what are the economic resources that the corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2270.241" offset="9184319">This corporation had earnings after federal income taxes of about $180,000.00 in 1965 and almost $400,000.00 in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.666" offset="9234056">It paid less than a third of these amounts out in dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.136" offset="9247953">In 1965, it paid $49,000.00 in cash dividend and distributed 870 shares of Xerox stock, in 1966, paid out $50,000.00 in cash dividends and a 10% stock dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.064" offset="9315662">Its reasonable needs as I say have been stipulated for 1965 they need at almost $2 million, I mean, a $1,200,000.00 and in 1966, they needed practically a million and a half, and these are liquid assets taken at book value and the parties has agreed that these amounts equal in needs of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.571" offset="9421615">If -- these are the liquid assets and they are the needs if you look at the book figures.</text>

            <text syncTime="2351.589" offset="9509700">It's the readily receivable things that can be converted into cash if you need to, and that brings us right to the point of how you value the Xerox stock.</text>

            <text syncTime="2373.045" offset="9595591">We agree with that and I think that the stipulations were designed to point that up and the real question is, we have also stipulated that after allowance for the capital gain's tax and the brokerage fees that the liquid assets of this corporation are practically double the figures that we stipulated as the corporate needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.943" offset="9679182">The liquid assets, if you look at fair market value or $2 million and two some in 1965 over $3 million in 1966, and here, 76% of the voting stock was owned by Ivan Allen Sr. and Ivan Allen Jr. and because of that, the commissioner of Internal Revenue determine this assessment.</text>
