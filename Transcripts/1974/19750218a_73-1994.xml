            <label>Mr. Leonard C. Jaques</label>
            <text syncTime="66.307" offset="368619">Got to the a railroad track, couldn’t get to the ship, laid down on railroad track.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.841" offset="394742">The train came along, amputated both legs.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.650" offset="417938">The question arose, what duty does the shipowner have with regard to payment of maintenance and cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.574" offset="457644">The Fifth Circuit held, in Myles versus Quinn Menhaden Fisheries Inc. 302 F.2d 146, that the duty of the shipowner did terminate at the time that there was provided for the seaman, a fitting of artificial legs.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.542" offset="581569">The Sixth Circuit would hold, in 1975, that there was no duty at all to provide any cure, any maintenance for the seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.519" offset="653458">In its holding on the Vella case, the Sixth Circuit had indicated, that one who was afflicted by trauma with a vestibular labyrinthine disorder had actually reached the maximum cure, at the time that the incident occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.373" offset="756903">This is borne in the opinion on page 29 of the brief -- of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.861" offset="794833">And there the court stated, “the record in this case did not permit an inference other than, that plaintiff’s condition was permanent immediately after the accident.”</text>
            <text syncTime="186.385" offset="848959">To look at the Sixth Circuit holding, with regard to this case, it would necessarily follow that there could be no manner by which a seaman who had reached that point of maximum medical cure, as was enunciated by this Court in Farrell versus United States, where there had been, in fact a declaration, that there had been a maximum cure rendered for the treatment of the seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.188" offset="1012172">For indeed if, once that particular declaration is made by a medical authority, according to the Sixth Circuit, relating back, the very onset of the incident which created the injury or the illness would have been in fact incurable.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.799" offset="1126588">Well, looking on these cases relative to maintenance and cure, the cure aspect, doesn’t mean cure in a medical sense solely, it means care.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.715" offset="1202239">There a question arises to what extent and this Court has never indicated that where there is treatment to provide a cure of an amelioratory nature, that would not permit a seaman to come within the scope of the doctrine and this court has never addressed itself to that very particular question.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.358" offset="1332851">I recognize that in Farrell and also in Vaughan versus Atkinson that the majority held that a seaman is not entitled to maintenance and cure payments for a lifetime.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.273" offset="1420413">What indeed the circuits have interpreted Farrell since it came down in 1949, the Third Circuit and the Fifth Circuit has consistently held and I must point out, that these two circuits, the Third and the Fifth, are quite active Maritime Circuits, much more than the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.523" offset="1553429">But with regard to the test, I cite the case of Smith versus Dale Hart, Inc, it's 315 F.Supp. 1162, or in 1969 AMC 2400, I cite it for the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.571" offset="1641618">In that case, the Court held that the maximum medical care does not mean to the point where a seamen has the ability to return to work, but to restore a seamen to the status of a functional human being.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.283" offset="1708492">Now that case is very similar to the case of Vella.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.068" offset="1723643">An action was brought for the negligence under the Jones Act, in addition to unseaworthiness of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.968" offset="1755199">It was held that there was no unseaworthiness of the vessel, no negligence under the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.261" offset="1792397">The third count, however, was with regard to maintenance and cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.337" offset="1808697">In that case the seamen suffered from a ruematoyed arthritic condition, degenerative spinal condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.610" offset="1857808">The orthopedic surgeon said, I can operate on him, I can cure him to the point where he can go back to sea, but I can cause him to be alleviated of pain and nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.665" offset="1917994">And there the Court held that this would be compensable and this is in line with the cases of Third Circuit such as --</text>

            <text syncTime="462.244" offset="1952371">Mr. Jaques do you think that kind of a question is raised by our -- the question we granted certiorari on?</text>
            <text syncTime="469.151" offset="1979956">Well, we just granted one of your three questions that you presented in your petition and that was, whether a seaman was entitled to maintenance and cure during the interim between the occurrence of the incident and the time the disease was medically diagnosed and declared incurable?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leonard_c_jaques" startTime="484.984" stopTime="563.841">
            <label>Mr. Leonard C. Jaques</label>
            <text syncTime="484.984" offset="2043277">Indeed Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.272" offset="2048502">Indeed, because embodied within that question, as it was framed, would be the question as to when and what time does the seamen -- the scope and duration, under what circumstance does he come within the scope and once he is within the scope or what is the duration?</text>
            <text syncTime="511.458" offset="2149230">And here in the Sixth Circuit opinion, under a very novel pronouncement, the Sixth Circuit said, there is more than a one step proposition, such as this Court held in the Osceola back in 1898, where a seamen was required to show that he actually sustained injury or became ill in the service of the vessel and at that time, it meant Your Honor, that he must have been actually performing work activities on the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.063" offset="2287574">Now, this Court in the Calmar versus Taylor case extended that and put the seamen ashore and where he is in fact injured ashore or sustains injury ashore, that is construed to be in the service of the ship, even though it's on a personal basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.470" offset="2357269">Now this --</text>

            <text syncTime="563.841" offset="2358732">Your man was injured aboard the ship though, where he was doing work wasn't he?</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard C. Jaques</label>
            <text syncTime="567.195" offset="2372106">Indeed he was, but the Sixth Circuit held that, that wasn't enough, that showing in and off itself is not enough Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.089" offset="2403767">The Sixth Circuit held, just as the shipowner argued that, he must not only show that he was injured while in the service of the vessel and indeed there is no question and they concede that, the shipowner indeed concedes that he was injured, that the jury did find that he was injured while in the service of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.493" offset="2497390">But the Sixth Circuit holds that the seaman has an additional duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.462" offset="2521213">That he must go forward and show that he has that there -- whatever he is afflicted with is curable.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.704" offset="2558203">This is why, it is indeed important to make a determination as to whether or not this additional step is required in accordance with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.076" offset="2611702">Take that situation alone; a Seaman who is saddled with responsibility to go forward to get medical authority to indicate that whatever he is afflicted with is curable in this day with the special problems that the Physicians have, it would be very difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.566" offset="2709608">When I say problem, I am talking about Physicians having problem with regard to malpractice insurance and for a Physician to diagnose someone with a specific type of disability and for the shipowner to require the Physician to indicate that he does in fact have a curable ailment, maybe construed by doctors as a contract to cure him with the inherent; and I don't mean this disparagingly but it would be inherent tendency of medical practitioners to act on a conservative basis, it's doubtful that any seaman could ever get any doctor to make such a declaration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1360.917" offset="5547029">In the case of the Bouker No. 2, 241 Fed. 831, the court stated at page 835, the limits of care or cure both as to kind of treatment and time of continuance must always depend on the facts of each particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.692" offset="5630098">Respondent in this case contends the facts at bar are of special significance in the resolution of the issue now before the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1402.849" offset="5714735">The petitioner in this case was an oiler on the S.S. Robert S. McNamara.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.613" offset="5737827">He claimed that while replacing a deck plate in the lower engine room, he slipped and fell, and bumped his head.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.190" offset="5776175">There was some doubt as to whether the petitioner reported that action at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.569" offset="5797700">Thereafter, the petitioner claimed that he suffered from dizziness, headaches, imbalance, and fear of falling, but he continued to perform his regular duties until June 28, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.884" offset="5858931">The alleged accident occurred some time, a date unknown to the petitioner in early April, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.310" offset="5888606">That means, he was on the ship for a period of almost 19 days doing his regular work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.744" offset="5910340">On June 28 the petitioner was discharged from the vessel for failing to obey the orders of a superior officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.604" offset="5945762">When the vessel arrived back at Dearborn following day on June 29, he was paid off and left the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.650" offset="5982020">During the course of the preparation of his discharge papers, the Third Assistant Engineer was doing this, the petitioner said and informed the Third Assistant Engineer that he had fallen back in April, 1968 and an accident report was prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.941" offset="6059133">Petitioner also requested and was issued a master certificate permitting him or a hospital ticket permitting him to go to the United States Public Health Service Hospital where free care is provided for a merchant seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.434" offset="6117125">Immediately, upon leaving the vessel, the petitioner was examined at respondent's plant hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.428" offset="6149099">This hospital is staffed by 15 physicians and 89 nurses and headed by Dr. Charles David Litterick (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.759" offset="6182431">Based upon the information supplied by the petitioner, Dr. Litterick gave a diagnosis of alleged left parietal contusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.897" offset="6222973">In as much as the petitioner denied visual difficulties, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or headaches in the Romberg test which is the test where you close our eyes, and if you sway back and forth to indicate you have a balance problem, that test was negative and similar test finger-to-finger test with your eyes closed, finger to nose with your eyes closed; again a balance test, these tests were all normal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.158" offset="6348048">Dr. Litterick ruled out vestibular damage, but based upon the petitioner's description that there was something electrical in his head, decided that complaint could relate to a tiny nerve branch contusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.287" offset="6408547">This he considered minor and he ordered a cold pack applied to the area where he described his harder electrical sensation and discharged him to enable to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.104" offset="6463822">From that day, June 29, 1968, petitioner went to the US Public Health Service Hospital in Detroit on three occasions, July 9, July 16 and September 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.974" offset="6519306">On each of those occasions, he was declared fit for duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.837" offset="6546683">It is to be noted in the appendix which sets forth these visits to the Public Health Service Hospital, that the petitioner when he went there, if he denied he had sustaining the unconsciousness, he had no headaches, dizziness, or other neural problems and nothing of an objective nature was found.</text>
