            <label>Mr. Bruce B. Wilson</label>
            <text syncTime="50.418" offset="305089">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.276" offset="324524">I was interested in listening to the prior argument because we were dealing with matters of economic reality, serious matters and matters which concerned individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.112" offset="375829">I think this case is a little different and it involves matters of economic reality which concern the national economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.197" offset="420133">This case is here today because in 1950, the Congress was concerned with increasing concentration in that national economy and it was concerned with increasing concentration which was resulting from mergers and acquisitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.911" offset="502993">And it was concerned with acquisitions by national companies of local firms and that kind of acquisition which was attributing -- contributing to that increasing concentration.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.665" offset="566000">Now, this case squarely presents the question of whether Congress effectively executed its expressed intention to prevent that kind of mergers and acquisitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.768" offset="626395">There's really only one issue or decision in this case, whether Congress in Section 7 of the Clayton Act intended to exercise the full scope of its power to reach mergers and acquisitions not only in commerce, in the flow of commerce but also those which affected commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.319" offset="724616">Now, if Congress didn't so intend and if Congress did not so effectively legislate then a series of acquisitions could occur, acquisitions of intrastate firms which could result in a situation which Congress clearly sought to avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.044" offset="811551">It sought to avoid that situation in a statute which it denominated as a supplement to the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.209" offset="848227">And as we shall see, Congress in the Sherman Act intended to exercise the full range of its power.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.557" offset="893576">And the facts of this case are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.143" offset="907995">In 1971, the United States filed this civil action under Section 7 challenging a transaction in which the American Building Maintenance Industries --</text>

            <label>Mr. Bruce B. Wilson</label>
            <text syncTime="235.772" offset="1046444">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.933" offset="1071104">Just before the luncheon recess, we had outlined the central issue in this civil antitrust case which was filed by the Government in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.895" offset="1114990">In this case, the Government challenged under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, a transaction in which affirmed American Building Maintenance Industries acquired control of two janitorial service firms doing business in Southern California.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.085" offset="1187715">One was the Benton Maintenance Company, the other was the J.E. Benton Management Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.702" offset="1218226">In terms of market shares at the time of the Acquisition, American controlled about 10% of the janitorial service market in Southern California and the Benton Companies combined had about 7%.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.537" offset="1285517">Now, of course, the statute with which we deal here today, Section 7 of the Clayton Act, prohibits the acquisition by any corporation engaged in commerce of the stock or assets of another corporation, engaged also in commerce where the effect of that acquisition maybe to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.968" offset="1387290">And this case involves the meaning of four words in that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.421" offset="1409024">Those four words being a corporation, also engaged in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.876" offset="1434833">There's no question as to whether the acquiring firm, American was engaged in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.651" offset="1469942">No such question has been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.645" offset="1481958">But the decision on the District Court was on a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the acquired firms were not corporations engaged also in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.411" offset="1540995">The Government introduced various affidavits, none of which I think are disputed showing that Benton had provided janitorial services necessary to support the interstate operation of its customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.205" offset="1608182">The Benton had purchased substantial quantities of janitorial supplies manufactured outside of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.943" offset="1643186">That it negotiated at least to major contracts without a state customer and that it did although to -- admittedly minor extent utilized interstate communications facilities in its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.572" offset="1709641">The court below entered summary judgment in 1973 and in doing so, it adopted almost rebut him the findings of fact and conclusions of law submitted by America but proposed prior to the time that the United States had filed its affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.447" offset="1785187">Of course, once the Court had concluded that, it resulted in a holding that Section 7 had no application to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.079" offset="1835656">But there was however in the court below, no opinion explaining the Court's reasoning as to how it reached its conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.288" offset="1884557">The first issue which this appeal raises and when which is easily disposed off, is whether the power of Congress could reach this kind of a transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.732" offset="1942340">This Court disposed of that question in Mandeville Island Farms against American Crystal Sugar in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.729" offset="1986330">There, the question was whether an agreement by Sugar Refiners which sold sugar in interstate commerce could agree on the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.000" offset="2035336">Whether they could agree on the price which they were going to pay to sugar beet growers located in Northern California.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.226" offset="2072325">This Court in that case clearly held that such an agreement on price was an agreement which affected commerce and one that was in -- within the reach of the Sherman Act, the first antitrust statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.124" offset="2139826">Now, of course, when we're dealing with the Sherman Act and with the Clayton Act, we are not dealing with the same statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.333" offset="2172740">But we are dealing with statutes in which Congress sought to address substantially the same problem, the problem of monopoly, the problem of trust, the problem of anticompetitive effects on the American economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.208" offset="2252152">When Congress passed the Clayton Act in 1914, it made clear that that Act was intended to supplement the Sherman Act which Congress had enacted in 1890.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.183" offset="2320071">In the light therefore of Mandeville farms, the holding of this Court in that case, there doesn't seem to be much question but that Congress if it so desired and intended could have made the scope of the Clayton Act equally as broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.080" offset="2395721">It could have reached a merger or acquisition of the type with which we deal here.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.205" offset="2420172">And this brings us I think down to the central issue, did Congress intend in Section 7 of the Clayton Act to exercise as it did in the Sherman Act the full extend of its power under the commerce clause?</text>
            <text syncTime="597.907" offset="2494986">I think if one looks at the history of the antitrust laws, one can conclude only that Congress in enacting Section 7 did intend to exercise the full extent of those powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.942" offset="2559143">In the Sherman Act, we have not only Mandeville farms, we have South-Eastern Underwriters in 1944 again holding that in that Act, Congress wanted to go to the full extent of its constitutional power in restraining trust agreements and in restraining monopoly agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.615" offset="2641795">And thus, given the history of that act, Senator George in 1890 stating that Sherman was ingeniously drawn to cover every case that is within the commercial power of Congress and Senator Sherman after whom the Act was of course named noting that the bill was just as broad and as sweeping and as explicit as the English language couldn't make it become then to 1914 and we see that Congress in 1914 dissatisfied and disappointed with the application of the 1890 law.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.794" offset="2818591">We find that Congress disappointed and dissatisfied with its efforts to control trust and monopolies.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.843" offset="2854745">And so in 1914, we find the Congress enacting a law, which according to its title was to supplement the existing laws against restraints and monopolies.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.134" offset="2907930">The Congress in that act wanted to arrest such restraints in their incipiency and they intended to do that insofar as it was possible to do so and they did it in Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1026.146" offset="4207992">Coming back to 1950, Congress then made the Act applicable to asset -- acquisitions of assets as well as the stock of competing corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.544" offset="4273507">And the House Report indicated that the 1950 amendments made the Act less restrictive prohibiting mergers and acquisitions where in any line of commerce in any section of the country, the effect of that acquisition might maybe to substantially lessen competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.834" offset="4358666">And the report made it clear that what Congress was trying to do was go even further if they could than they went in the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.686" offset="4402134">One can't conclude looking at that legislative history that Congress intended that the reach of the Clayton Act should be less than the reach of the Sherman Act but there was a concern raised in Congress at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.470" offset="4469217">That the Act might be construed to prohibit the acquisition of a local business by another local business in the same town.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.785" offset="4514461">These concerns are addressed in the legislative history and rather than narrowing the reach of the jurisdiction under the commerce requirement that Congress limited the terms of the substantive offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.331" offset="4588648">The original draft provided that the Act would be violated, if competition was substantially lessened in any community and that language concerned the Senate and the Senate noted that that language was dropped and the phrase "in any section of the country" was substituted in order to get rid of that concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.080" offset="4699721">But even so, the Senate also concurred in the view that it was the purpose of this legislation to assure a broader construction of the more fundamental provisions that are retained than has been given in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.564" offset="4773595">Then we come and now retrogressing a little bit to the questions of the 1936 amendments which inserted in the Clayton Act provisions governing price discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.680" offset="4834095">But those provisions and the merger provisions of Section 7 have very different jurisdictional test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.101" offset="4871816">And the jurisdictional tests under the price discrimination provisions were those construed by this Court in Gulf Oil Corporation against Copp Paving Company decided earlier this term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.090" offset="4927718">The Court there expressly declined to decide the decision and to decide the question which we are dealing here with today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.092" offset="4971708">If one examines those jurisdictional provisions, the differences are immediately apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.874" offset="5002846">To violate the price discrimination provisions, one must be engaged in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.099" offset="5023744">Yes, the same language which we have under the merger provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.533" offset="5041507">One must also make a sale in the course of such commerce and finally, either or any of the purchasers involved in the price discrimination must be in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.053" offset="5103574">So, we have there a three part test for jurisdictional purposes, not the single test which is involved in Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.355" offset="5156760">Second, I think we have to note that this Court has recognized that the Congressional enactments dealing with commerce reveal a process of legislation which is words of I believe Mr. Justice Frankfurter strikingly empiric.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.794" offset="5238575">The Court has uniformly looked to what Congress was trying to do in enacting particular statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.337" offset="5272743">Again, Mr. Justice Frankfurter said, if we do -- if we do not do that to search for a dependable touch zone is as rewarding as an attempt to square the circle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.113" offset="5335855">So, we have to look to the intent of Congress in passing this statute in 1914, in amending it again in 1950 and the construction which this Court has since placed on Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.035" offset="5419551">The Court in Von's Grocery noted that the 1950 amendments were designed to broaden the scope of the antitrust laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="1400.783" offset="5706480">For example, the Sections -- what is now Section 7 of the Clayton Act applies only to corporations, whereas, the Sherman Act applies to individual people as well as corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.501" offset="5761337">Now, that certainly is a more limiting jurisdictional coverage, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1532.320" offset="6232691">And I think to this case, we've already discussed the Bennington Bank case, the whole issue in that case, everything else was conceded was whether the Bennington area of Vermont was a section of the country for the purposes of Section 7, that's how the Congress limited the reach of the statute in addition to limiting its reach to corporations rather than natural persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.579" offset="6349720">Then I think Von's Grocery is a good example of something which is a purely local merger.</text>

            <text syncTime="1586.125" offset="6447835">And this Court noted that in that case Congress had passed the 1950 amendments to prevent a destruction of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.015" offset="6491408">It noted that the cases since the passage of that act have faithfully endeavored to enforce that congressional command and the United States believes that the Court should today continue to enforce that congressional command.</text>

            <label>Mr. Marcus Mattson</label>
            <text syncTime="1639.893" offset="6662980">Mr. Chief Justice and may the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.991" offset="6683355">I'm not here to deny the Clayton Act was intended to reach areas not reached by the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.337" offset="6716688">I'm not here to deny that as to specifically limited transactions and specifically limited entities, Congress exercised far reaching commerce powers or that they exercised all of their commerce power, I don't -- only history can tell because only ingenuity can define how far those powers go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.323" offset="6812714">Obviously, Congress exercised its power only with regard to acquisitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.352" offset="6840822">Contrary to the Sherman Act, it was every contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.610" offset="6861824">It exercised in Clayton 7 only with regarded corporations engaged in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.286" offset="6892544">Now, this Court has already said in Gulf Oil versus Copp that that language appears to denote only persons or activities within the flow of interstate commerce, the practical, economic continuity in generation of goods and services for interstate markets and their transport and distribution to the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.355" offset="6988779">With that legal principle, the past enforcement pattern of the Department of Justice has until now agreed as Mr. Justice Powell has indicated from page 36 of the Government's brief, this case marks the advent of a new policy in the Department of Justice in the enforcement of the Clayton Act 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.643" offset="7093896">And the fact that this policy as stated on page 36 of the Government's brief precisely conforms with the explicit terms of Section 7 is according to the Government's intimation only coincidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.914" offset="7174980">This conformity says the Government, simply reflects the fact that the Government has devoted its limited enforcement resources to areas where the need is most pressing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.964" offset="7227225">The Government's new so-called application of the statute and I was surprised to hear that counsel now says that the words that we rely on are surpluses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.044" offset="7275499">But they now -- they say in their briefs that their application is that the words engaged in commerce includes not only activities in the flow of commerce but also local activities that substantially affect interstate commerce and those are their words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.929" offset="7355120">The statute of course is doubly explicit to the contrary not only must they acquire incorporation be engaged in commerce but also the acquired corporation must be engaged also in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.048" offset="7415515">The repetition of those terms demonstrates that they were obviously important to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.333" offset="7444668">This importance has until now and for more than 60 years than recognized by the department of justice as it's passed enforcement pattern and that's what it caused it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.560" offset="7497644">There are additionally important features in the record which indicate that the new policy of the department of justice was not in mind when it initiated this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.687" offset="7542157">And as not even yet given it adequate consideration, thus file the Government positively states on page 36 again that it is true and this is the Government's words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.144" offset="7595969">It is true that previous Section 7 cases have involved both acquiring and acquired firms engaged in the flow of commerce.</text>

            <label>Mr. Marcus Mattson</label>
            <text syncTime="1923.133" offset="7795858">I thought perhaps they felt that they're -- they hardly conceive that there was anyone who had such local operation as the Benton Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.357" offset="7840789">They assumed that everybody could be included within commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.959" offset="7859179">They didn't understand what the janitorial business was about when they brought the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.513" offset="7881435">And that's my judgment as to why this case was bought -- brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.235" offset="7908289">Now, they say in their -- to continue and may perhaps this is along the line of your idea Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.628" offset="7941935">They say in their reply brief that the Department of Justice has never taken that position that is that the -- that they had a past enforcement pattern along the lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.786" offset="7998568">They say that they had in -- on page 36 of their brief in chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.620" offset="8021870">So they go out of their 860 year history under Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.011" offset="8043395">They were able to select only two cases to support the denial of what they said in page -- on page 36.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.824" offset="8078712">One was the Bennington National Bank case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.209" offset="8092191">Now, every one knows that banks are engaged in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.197" offset="8108178">That's a long since been decided, there are no question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.651" offset="8121971">So, that case doesn't indicate one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.795" offset="8138585">The other is the Von's Shopping bag case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.141" offset="8155930">There, the Government proved its allegation that both the acquired and the acquiring corporations were supermarket chains and its allegation and I read from the complaint, such chains operate purchasing offices which are in contact with suppliers located throughout the United States to purchase and affect the shipment of substantial quantities of groceries and related products from producing facilities located in the various states to the change distribution centers and supermarkets in the Los Angeles area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.373" offset="8316844">The facts here would not support any such allegation and none was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.516" offset="8353416">And as Mr. Justice White asked, we looked -- we -- it is reasonable to assume that if the Government had in mind a new application of the statute, a new extension of the statute and was prepared to prove it, its complaint would have reflected these facts and yet you look in vein for any allegation in this complaint that Benton, the acquired corporation was engaged in local activities that substantially affected interstate commerce, there's nothing of that in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.278" offset="8520495">If you look in vein for any allegation which would describe the commerce so affected or which was state -- what the effect had been?</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.983" offset="8559261">The most that is found are the allegations in paragraph 8 of the complaint that the acquiring corporation maintains offices and serves customers in various states of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.564" offset="8613595">But as to Benton, the acquired corporation, there is no comparable allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.254" offset="8640345">As to Benton, it is alleged only that some of its customers and some of its vendors were engaged in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.687" offset="8686111">This state of the pleadings, evidences and inconsistency with the Government's new application of the statute and shows a total disregard of the explicit jurisdictional requirements of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.339" offset="8744730">I mentioned that I didn't think they understood the janitorial service business and I think that perhaps that's one of their basic failures in bringing this case to start with.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="2171.979" offset="8791333">But you're not suggesting are you that the case went back to the District Court Mr. Mattson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.844" offset="8814738">The Government were to amend its complaint to supply this deficiencies and you had the same affidavits that then the District Court ought not -- ought to deny the motion for summary judgment?</text>

            <text syncTime="2188.779" offset="8858520">No, I don't think they could support the situation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.975" offset="8883284">I'm only indicating that because there seem to be a question that why did they bring this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.218" offset="8920273">And that my only indication is from the complaint itself, they didn't have a basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.723" offset="8950262">They made a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.679" offset="8962069">Now, janitors don't manufacture a product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.329" offset="8976697">They don't sell a product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.857" offset="8986833">Their raw material is unskilled labor which necessarily must be obtained locally for the rendering of a local service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.979" offset="9023300">Janitors can't go in to other than their local areas to compete for unskilled labor their raw material or to get it at lower price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.804" offset="9070634">A janitorial firm can of course expand and go national as the acquiring corporations in here or it can elect to remain local as Benton, the acquired corporations here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.869" offset="9130820">Of course, janitors need mops, pails, soap and that sort of thing but these supplies are incidental and are extensively available from local vendors just as they are to the local housewife.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.350" offset="9196753">Benton to an extraordinary degree limited these activities to the Southern California area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.343" offset="9228727">When the Government's discovery efforts developed at Benton's interstate purchases aggregative $140.00 and then its interstate telephone calls cost only $19.78, the Government was driven to a conceding in its footnote number 5 that Benton's interstate purchases were admittedly small.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.578" offset="9337710">Further confirmation of that fact is -- and the fact that Benton's operation were intensely local, it's shown by the fact that no officer, no employee of Benton traveled outside of California on business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.863" offset="9406777">There is every evidence that Mr. Benton who founded the business was convinced that if he satisfied the local people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.012" offset="9447424">That if he cleaned their buildings properly and they were the one with whom he had to a deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.183" offset="9472084">He need not waste the firm's money on any non-essentials connected with interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.595" offset="9509804">There's -- I think the Government also started from a false premise as to the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.132" offset="9551914">We were willing -- we would have found no necessity of going to legislative history because the statute is explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.969" offset="9583261">It was the Government that went to the legislative history here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.788" offset="9602487">And the unrestricted freedom with which the Government exercised their reference to the explicit language of Section 7 is based upon a misunderstanding of the legislative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.903" offset="9666957">The Government persist in urging that Congress had not considered the meaning of the words engaged also in commerce in connection with Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.835" offset="9706663">That of course is an unflattering conclusion because the legislators must have known that they were putting that language in at least.</text>

            <text syncTime="3049.617" offset="12301876">Some members of Congress and for a time the Justice Department forced the view that bank mergers were still beyond the reach of the section as to which this Court said, the views of a subsequent Congress form a hazardous basis for the intent of the early one.</text>

            <text syncTime="3155.040" offset="12723493">The Standard Oil company of California case confirms our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.231" offset="12748257">The Court there was dealing not with the narrowly directed jurisdictional question of Section 3 as we are here with Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.941" offset="12795173">Standard Oil company was obviously engaged in commerce with any question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.849" offset="12822758">And under Section 3, it was necessary that only one of the corporation making the contract be engaged in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.239" offset="12864345">Standard Oil Company was the question which this Court faced and determined in the Standard Oil case was whether the requirements contracts lessened competition under the broadly phrase portion of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.686" offset="12942085">The -- since the contracts prevented service station operators from dealing with suppliers from outside of California as well as within the state and because the large number of such contracts, competition was lessened in both intrastate and interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.457" offset="13029230">But again, that was the operative portion, not the jurisdictional portion of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.806" offset="13058591">There was no issue as to whether standard was engaged in commerce and the operative portion of Section 3 was satisfied by extensive evidence on the structure of the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.439" offset="13113135">And the substantiality of the number of requirements contracts, and I think that case will demonstrate to the Court that there has been no satisfying the requirements of the Government's own proposal with regard to Section 7 and they say it should read that local activities which have a substantial effect on interstate commerce but they have proved no such effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.518" offset="13229432">All they have shown is that we receive money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.969" offset="13251271">They said 80% to 90% of our revenues form interstate operators.</text>

            <text syncTime="3300.830" offset="13306650">And they have shown nothing with regard to the structure of any product which we bought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.479" offset="13337266">They merely show that we bought -- I think it's a $150,000.00 worth according to the briefs, I can't find where they got that figure in the record but be that as it may, they've shown no market structure of any kind with regard to any market of goods that passed in to interstate commerce before we bought them.</text>
