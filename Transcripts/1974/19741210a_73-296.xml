            <text syncTime="49.250" offset="300387">The first is the question of the interference of federal courts in state judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.917" offset="323062">The second, concerns the question of the constitutionality of the padlock provision of the Ohio Public Nuisance Statute as applied in this case to a theater showing pornographic movies as a continuing regular course of business.</text>

            <label>Mr. James J. Clancy</label>
            <text syncTime="103.880" offset="518875">That's right Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.954" offset="531205">The particular situation here, involved the showing of 16 pornographic movies in approximately 10-week period.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.397" offset="560985">Now withstanding the paramount importance of the second issue that is, that this Court should resolve the padlock provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.281" offset="588466">Appellants would urge this Court to decide the matter on the appeal on points one and two in the brief, and hold that the Federal District Court had no jurisdiction, no subject matter jurisdiction to consider the merits of the courts below because of two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.565" offset="653667">One, under the interim or res exception, the res was under the jurisdiction of the state court which had exclusive jurisdiction to decide that matter to the exclusion of the federal court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.028" offset="711450">And two, under the lis pendens doctrine, Pursue Limited took its interest as an assignee with notice and was concluded thereby from filing a declaratory judgment action in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.373" offset="772890">Now, there are at least three reasons why the court should assign priority to the first and decide the case on the first issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.928" offset="799117">First, this nation is at the present time faced with an alarming rate of growth of pornographic theaters.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.395" offset="832972">They are in every hamlet, village, and township in this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.593" offset="857736">I'm sorry too, the statements in some newspapers, they are not in a decline.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.661" offset="878007">I can explain why they are not in the decline.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.413" offset="888978">Second, the public nuisance is the only way in which this vice operation can be brought under control.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.492" offset="913324">And third, the defense tactics which were employed in this case if allowed to continue as a modus operandi for defense attorneys in such cases will destroy the efficacy of the public nuisance approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.092" offset="975705">The opportunity for the defense attorneys to engage in a volleyball offensive by using the federal removal actions and to federal equitable interference as was accomplished in this case must be withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.532" offset="1033488">It was never intended by Congress nor the constitution that the federal court system should sit in appellate review on state court decisions, particularly, when those state court decisions were final.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.049" offset="1091584">Similarly, the opportunity for defense attorneys to avoid public nuisance findings in state trial courts and to provide a springboard for a federal declaratory judgment action at law by successive assignments after they are in court on the merits has got -- as was accomplished in this case, also is got to be stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.931" offset="1187088">The solution to the above problems is to be found in the well-recognized and widely accepted legal principles cited in points one and two of appellant's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.245" offset="1220315">One, reaffirmation of the interim or res exception which prevents federal interference where the state in action is in rem, will prevent the volleyball; offensive which has frustrated to public nuisance concept and I cite here Toucey versus New York Life, Orton versus Smith, Princess Lida of Thurn versus Thompson, and Donovan versus Dallas.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.463" offset="1305266">And in Donovan versus Dallas is applied to federal cases, this Court said that, it was a matter of power or a lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.740" offset="1334314">In Orton versus Smith, that was a natural application or of -- or a consideration by this Court of a federal court saying that the state has the power -- has a res and it should stay out of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="470.666" offset="1986017">Touching upon the -- my one answer to the opinion is that their legal reasoning is wrong and they asked themselves the wrong question.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.881" offset="2018931">Our remarks on the legal reasoning are cited from Brumbaugh, legal reasoning at pages 74 to 77 and we further point to the two cases cited by us in the appendix case A and D, Cincinnati Properties Inc. versus Lease, People ex rel. Hicks v. Sarong Gals, where we say the Court therein asked the property question and devoted its legal analysis properly to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.498" offset="2153409">In the People of State of California ex rel. Hicks, the court said, “Of course just as a court order for the incarceration of a convicted law breaker impinges and all sorts of constitutional rights so does the abatement order, the order, shutting down the proffered, excepting for limited uses as specifically authorized however by Penal Code Section 11230 which permits the closing of the offending building against its use for any purpose for a period of one year.”</text>
            <text syncTime="540.731" offset="2266258">The question is therefore, not whether the order impinges unconstitutionally guaranteed rights but whether the statute constitutes a permissible exercise of the state police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.676" offset="2306069">The court then goes on to say the provision in Penal Code Section 11230 authorizing closure of the offending property to all uses for a period of one year while harsh is constitutionally permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.455" offset="2349223">It then says it has to be remembered that to (Inaudible) abatement procedures are directed against the offending property itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.374" offset="2376913">Their purpose it has been said is to the -- in fact the reformation of the property itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="897.417" offset="3693066">Passing onto the action that was filed, this matter began two years ago, September of 18, 19 -- September 18, 1972 with the prosecuting attorney of Allen County, Ohio, filing an action in the Common Pleas Court against Dakota and everyone who had any kind of an interest in that property, the real property owners, the known lessee, everyone that could possibly be identified as holding a recorded interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.977" offset="3819290">In his allegations, he stated that the Cinema I Theatre which was being operated on that real property was engaged in violation of the public nuisance statute and was showing obscene films.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.702" offset="3874147">At paragraph 70, alleged that for a period of 10 weeks, the Cinema I Theatre had consistently shown obscene pictures and then recited in detail not as an -- an application for a search warrant at Lee Art Theatre versus Virginia where they just said, “We have seen an obscene film and this is it, we want to pick it up.”</text>
            <text syncTime="959.047" offset="3939558">He said, “These are the films that were shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.180" offset="3952097">This is a period they were shown and this is what they show.”</text>
            <text syncTime="966.761" offset="3970382">They described in detail what the films were and in addition at the paragraph -- in the same paragraph, incorporated by reference, time motion studies of approximately 10,000 photographs which made a time motion analysis of what goes -- what was depicted in those films.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.105" offset="4055751">It went on to allege at paragraph 10, that the exhibition of the said motion picture films at the Cinema I here and above alleged constitutes a public nuisance as described in the public nuisance statute, State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.174" offset="4104025">He then went on further to say that for the following reason and explained what depictions were in violation of these -- specific depictions were in violation of the state statutes and those are recited in detail at pages, C pages, C 12 through C 13 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.393" offset="4192946">Now, having stated what the films were, what they -- having shown pictorially what they were, having described the acts which were contained therein which were in violation of the state law, he then asked for the following prayer that the nuisance before it was abated by order of the court and that the defendants and all of them, and all persons acting by or through them be restrained from exhibiting said motion picture films in the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.396" offset="4296913">At the same time, having filed the civil action, he asked for a provision or remedy which is allowed under the statute and that is the motion for preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.721" offset="4330245">If filed, the hearing must be had within 10 days and upon five days notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.522" offset="4349471">He did file the motion for a preliminary injunction and the matter did come up for a hearing which time the court viewed four films which had been under subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.887" offset="4382908">The court viewed the entire four films and on October the 24th, issued and this was in an adversary hearing in which the defense counsel appeared, and responded and provided and offered their defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.801" offset="4434526">The court issued -- filed its order in October the 24th in which he said that the nuisance does exist as alleged by the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.193" offset="4472142">He then ordered the Cinema I Theatre closed forthwith for any purpose of lewdness to with the projection of screening of lewd, indecent, lascivious or obscene films.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.896" offset="4506937">But in addition, having closed it temporarily, he said that the Court orders that the defendant shows cost if only they can, why this closing order should not be made permanent as of this date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.820" offset="4546644">Having found that the public nuisance did exist after a trial in the merits, the court under the statute was required -- the defendants were required to come forward and show that the nuisance have been abated or give on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.397" offset="4592933">And the order on October 24th to the defendants was to come forward and show either that the nuisance had been abated or wandered -- come forward with some other remedy you may have under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.165" offset="4640057">Instead, the defendants marched over to the federal court and file an action, William Dicota versus Faren Gaelach (ph), the investigators involved in which they pleaded the complaint itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.076" offset="4691675">So, they set before that the Federal District Court a complete recitation of what was involved in the state court proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1220.417" offset="4985083">At the end of other adversary hearings in which the defense counsel was present and after presentation of evidence and 12 additional films, the Court entered its final injunction on November the 30th, finding the allegations of the plaintiff's complaint, verified complaint true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.044" offset="5055509">And finding that in -- had engaged in a course of conduct of displaying motion picture films at the Cinema I Theatre which were obscene and that the course of conduct in the continuing exhibition of the films constituted nuisance under the statute he permanently enjoined and restrained them from conducting the said nuisance and he continued, he continued paying no attention what the federal court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.289" offset="5152580">He continued his order, the padlocking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.161" offset="5163969">Thereupon in having filed the final order, the defendants could've taken an appeal but no, they left that matter stand and they went back into the federal court, this time with a different defendant, Pursue Limited, saying that Pursue Limited is a new assignee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.502" offset="5241396">He purchased his interest in November the 17th while this matter was entrained and now he wants to litigate the same thing over.</text>

            <text syncTime="1455.286" offset="5924551">Oh, Justice -- this honorable Court, the history of this line of action which have just recount in September 18, 1972, over two years ago, those matters are not yet resolved and this is not an exceptional case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.378" offset="5972929">It's the modus operandi for defense attorneys all around the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.520" offset="5985468">The -- there's carbon copies for this in every state in the union, really.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.558" offset="6005635">And I think, this -- I know from personal example that the State of California and the County of Los Angeles is in a similar mess and this Court has just noted the jurisdiction of a similar case, Hicks versus Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.615" offset="6053804">Now, the jurisdiction on that case would not begin to recount the events which are accounted -- which are occurring in the Federal District Court there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.509" offset="6081390">That's simply a limited question on peripheral matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.918" offset="6099048">I think as I said before, this is not an exceptional case and I think that the -- it is in the essence that the prosecutors here have stayed with it, Mr. Huffman and Mr. Herman, they really stayed with it (Inaudible) through all of the federal interference and have pushed it along as they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.929" offset="6175117">In my opinion, they do not -- they should not be treated as they have in the federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.977" offset="6199254">As for example, being brought before that court and an order to show cause why they should not be held in contempt when following this Court's decision in June of 1973 and the failure of this Court to give them extra ordinary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.329" offset="6248678">They came back and they said to the Court, they filed another action and attempted once again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.020" offset="6283473">They were stopped immediately on an order to show cause why they should not be held in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.599" offset="6301759">It seems unbelievable to me that such a result should be obtained under the Civil Rights Act of 1871 when this Court in 1850 just 21 years before the Civil Rights Act was adopted; (Inaudible) versus Commonwealth, the suppression of nuisances in juries to public health and morality is amongst the most important duties of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.788" offset="6370513">It is the principle of the common law that the king cannot sanction a nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.307" offset="6388590">The autoptical evidence which was before the court below and the motion to dismiss the complaint as a sham pleading etcetera, brought to the Federal District Court clear knowledge of what was involved in the Allen County Common Pleas Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.419" offset="6449089">And it seems to me that the federal -- if this condition is to prevail, then it must be concluded the federal system of justice is underwriting to put it crudely and bluntly, cock sucking, and whore maundering which to me is completely in violation of my thinking of an American way of life and the American justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.178" offset="6532054">Now, that's the first time I've ever used those words in my entire life and you know, I think it's appropriate that I use it now so that this Court understand what is occurring in the federal court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.686" offset="6570088">I say the majority of this Court does not want this to come about.</text>

            <text syncTime="1770.035" offset="7183548">Briefly, with regard to this action, Mr. Huffman as prosecuting attorney filed the suit to close Cinema I Theatre in Lima, Ohio, under the 3767.01 and following statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.498" offset="7269334">Interesting to note -- it is interesting to note that under the Ohio's scheme, a tenant, a pure tenant has no right once a temporary injunction is issued to abate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3625.243" offset="14604309">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.650" offset="14605981">I'd like to make something clear about how this preliminary injunction issues and I'm reading now from b (5), I think the court has a misconception of what happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.251" offset="14640358">It says here, if at the time a granting a temporary injunction, it further appears that the person owning and control or in charge of the nuisance so enjoined had received five days notice of the hearing and unless such person shows to the satisfaction of the court of judge that the nuisance complained of is abated, then he issues the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.614" offset="14713814">But at the time he finds that there is a public nuisance exists, the defendant can abate say, “I've abated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.111" offset="14739832">I have withdrawn the film.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.279" offset="14744534">Now on the case of “Without a Stitch” the defendant there notwithstanding the trial judge finding that it was an obscene film continued to show it and the court said, “Well, you can't do it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.031" offset="14787480">So, I suggest that under the circumstance in this case had the defendants come forward and said, “We're going to stop showing these pornographic films.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.734" offset="14818304">They would not have been foreclosed because they would've shown to the -- at least they could have told or given some evidence to the judge that the public nuisance complained of have done abated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.322" offset="14864697">The Ohio Supreme Court has said that, “If the defendant comes forward and does not show “Without a Stitch”, then that nuisance has been abated and the place cannot be padlock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.871" offset="14910882">But it said that, “If there is a finding by the trial judge that a public nuisance does exist then he must padlock it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.953" offset="14943169">Now, there's been at least three cases filed in Toledo area, one is the “Deep Throat”, the other is the “Stewardess”, and the other is “Without a Stitch”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.356" offset="14972844">All three of those have gone through the system and the Westwood Theater is still in operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.085" offset="14995728">It has even -- notwithstanding the fact that the order stands that it must be abated.</text>

            <text syncTime="3731.397" offset="15028955">Justice Stewart was asking whether or not a state would prevent the business from being closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.008" offset="15047450">Now, taking a look at 3767.11 as to whether or not this is in aid of the statute 37 -- of -- in aid of the criminal law, 3767.11 says, “Procedure on nuisance establishing criminal proceeding, in a case the existence of a nuisance is established in a criminal proceeding, the public -- the prosecuting -- the attorney shall proceed promptly under Section 3767.01, which clearly says it's in aid of.</text>
