            <text syncTime="39.759" offset="262457">This case presents the question of what is the appropriate judgment to enter at this time for the violation of -- for a violation of the Williams Act which occurred in the spring and summer of 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.885" offset="330898">The District Court Western District of Wisconsin, Judge Doyle determined in 19 -- February of 1973 that the appropriate judgment was to dismiss the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.616" offset="377814">This was pursuant to a motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.382" offset="392861">The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded in July of 1974 directing the District Court to enter an order sterilizing 3% of the stock of the defendant Mr. Rondeau for a period of five years and permanently enjoining Mr. Rondeau from further violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.083" offset="471751">The Williams Act as you know amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in essence it provides that a shareholder who requires more than 5% of the shares of a covered company and that figure incidentally was 10% until December 31, 1970 approximately 6 months before the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.694" offset="558164">A shareholder requires more than 5% as required to file a schedule 13D which sets forth his identity, sources of financing purpose and other manners.</text>

            <text syncTime="209.707" offset="942164">That matter was strenuously contested on appeal as Judge Pell's dissent indicates but both the majority in the Court of Appeals and the dissent Judge Pell agreed with Judge Doyle that summary judgment was appropriate and that the facts were not -- the operative facts were not immaterial dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.086" offset="1079672">We think improperly because no cross petition for certiorari was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.415" offset="1100988">The facts as stated by Judge Doyle are essentially these.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.326" offset="1120632">Most and is a company in central Wisconsin engaged in the manufacture of pulp and paper is located in a small community Mosinee near WASA.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.092" offset="1155741">Mr. Rondeau was a businessman in Mosinee.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.120" offset="1167862">His business is a cold storage and cheese manufacture.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.039" offset="1183535">He operates several companies, some of which bare his name and all of which are clearly identified with him and those smaller communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.638" offset="1213942">He began to purchase Mosinee stock in April of 1971 because he thought it to be a good investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.919" offset="1239019">By May 17, his holdings had exceeded 5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.273" offset="1252498">He had over 40,000 shares and 40,309 shares was 5%.Accordingly he was required to file a schedule 13D on May 27, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.572" offset="1301608">He did not do so and that's not contested de facto violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.602" offset="1321775">It was not until the chairman of the board of Mosinee and Mr. Forester wrote to Mr. Rondeau on July 30 and called to his attention in the letter that he might have problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.602" offset="1365765">Here, Rondeau might have problems under the Securities Act that Mr. Rondeau for the first time consulted legal counsel and was advised that he indeed did have problems under the Act and that he should discontinue his purchases and accumulate the information to file a schedule 13D which the District Court found that he promptly did.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.758" offset="1442356">It was filed on August 25, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.243" offset="1460328">This action was filed September 2, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.285" offset="1476524">That's an important fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.375" offset="1484884">It is quite clear we submit that Mr. Rondeau did not file in response to this action nor was the purpose we believe of this suit to force Mr. Rondeau to file rather it was to neutralize him or tie him up.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.998" offset="1547368">In short it was not to enforce the Act but it was to use the Act to the advantage of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.339" offset="1572760">Now that's indicated because the customary conduct in cases of this nature is for the company to file a motion for preliminary injunction, frequently to seek a TRO.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.345" offset="1620720">The motion for preliminary injunction here was not filed with the complaint but was filed some weeks later and then was withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.276" offset="1652485">In itself indicating that the company was apparently not sustaining irreparable injury which required to a preliminary injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.924" offset="1779022">The allocation between various purchasers, various defendants was slightly misstated.</text>

            <text syncTime="450.080" offset="1903679">The amendment was perhaps filed out of the abundance of caution.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.925" offset="1923114">We do not contend one way or the other whether it was filed in response to the lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="468.393" offset="1976926">The original schedule indicated that he -- one of his purposes might be to tender for stock to seek control and the amendment simply amplify that to simply some additional language.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.519" offset="2033455">At the time of these purchasers -- purchases, the chairman of Mosinee was the man by the name of Forester, a lawyer who did not practice but who with his companies managed trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.351" offset="2076818">Mr. Forester, his family and the trust that he managed were the largest shareholders in -- as a group of Mosinee.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.597" offset="2105762">The president was Mr. Sholtons.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.046" offset="2115584">They became informed of Mr. Rondeau's purchases very early and both of them monitored his purchases by keeping tabulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.357" offset="2152782">Mr. Sholtons called Mr. Rondeau when his purchases reached the level of approximately 18,000 shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.322" offset="2184652">Mr. Rondeau purchases were open and notorious.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.747" offset="2202311">Most of the shares were purchased in his own name, some 34,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.418" offset="2221014">No shares were purchased in street name.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.825" offset="2234702">Over 40,000 shares were purchased in the -- his own name or in the names of companies bearing his name.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.011" offset="2263437">There seems to be no dispute that at least by June or July, it was well known to Mr. Sholtons and Mr. Forester that Rondeau was also associated with Mosinee cold storage and WASA cold storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.418" offset="2317040">Mr. Forester's letter to Rondeau refers to rumors in the mail and the District Court found that it was well known that Rondeau was purchasing stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.640" offset="2353925">His purpose, he has testified on deposition and there were some 23 depositions taken in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.652" offset="2377958">His purpose initially was a matter of investment and continued to be a matter of investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.395" offset="2400946">As he acquired more shares, he express some interest in stockholder representation on the board but the District Court found that he had no control purpose and took no active steps toward the objective of control until after he receive Mr. Forester's letter, talk to his attorney and was advised that in the 13D, he would have to state a purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.602" offset="2509824">The conservative advice given by attorneys in filing 13D schedules is to state any purpose that you have or may have so that the veracity of your 13D cannot later be challenged if you decide to proceed with a tender offer or proxy statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.363" offset="2588818">That was what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.662" offset="2598013">But even by the time that this 13D was filed, he had taken no real active steps toward a tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.100" offset="2623822">He had no financing line up.</text>

            <text syncTime="636.801" offset="2650572">The District Court concluded that there was no issue that Mr. Rondeau had no serious intent to attain -- to attempt to obtain control prior to Forester's letter that Mr. Rondeau and his associates did not engage in intentional covert or conspiratorial conduct rather that the violation was unintentional and we submit the simple fact of the way he purchased the shares and how they were registered and the fact that he knew that they knew that he was purchasing, supports that.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.953" offset="2787140">And that Mr. Rondeau scheduled 13D, met the requirements of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.402" offset="2808978">The Court therefore concluded that since there was an unintentional mistake, and with the passage of time, if being some 1 year and a half after the violation had occurred that it was appropriate to dismiss the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.336" offset="2868746">It is now of course several years after the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.480" offset="2881285">There has been no tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.121" offset="2887868">There has been no proxy contest.</text>

            <text syncTime="712.631" offset="2953906">The Court of Appeals took quite a different view.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.619" offset="2965817">The Court of Appeals in my view accepted the facts as recited by Mr. -- by Judge Doyle.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.960" offset="3003225">But the Court of Appeals held that since there was a violation, there had to be some sort of a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.727" offset="3030288">And ordered a permanent injunction against further violation and a sterilization of 3% of the stock by which I mean he could not exercise the ordinary rights of a shareholder to vote 3% of his shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.583" offset="3085667">The difference between the 5% and the 8% that he ultimately acquire.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.392" offset="3108968">The Courts of Appeals decision is somewhat ambiguous on the matter of harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.093" offset="3135718">They do say that Mosinee was harmed back in 1971 because they got the 13D information late.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.081" offset="3167692">But there is no indication of continuing harm or any harm in 1974 and they go on to state, that in all events no proof of irreparable harm is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.650" offset="3210010">Obviously, this was a matter that was debated among the judges because there is a strong dissent by Judge Pell and a thorough discussion which I commend to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.123" offset="3251911">There was no finding by the Court of Appeals of a reasonable likelihood of future violations which would I submit be necessary to support a permanent injunction and there was no explanation by the Court of Appeals of a nexus between the violation, any harm that may have resulted from the violation and the relief that is ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.268" offset="3344488">In short, the relief that is ordered really doesn't bare any relationship I submit to what the Court found the violation to be or the harm to have existed back in 1971 if there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.184" offset="3400077">Perhaps I should state clearly what we are not contending.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.615" offset="3417840">We do not dispute that the act was violative.</text>

            <text syncTime="1648.515" offset="6697462">It is our position the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals did not adopt the findings of fact of Judge Doyle.</text>

            <text syncTime="1719.052" offset="6979584">That's what I believe they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.142" offset="6987943">And I would like to get in to just what I think the Seventh Circuit concluded on the facts in presenting my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.597" offset="7025768">As counsel says, there is no question but what violation did in fact occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.765" offset="7050428">And the issue apparently is whether the relief granted in this instance by the Seventh Circuit is appropriate under the circumstances whether wrong was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.915" offset="7099016">There is no doubt in this instance that the market operator for a substantial period of time without knowing that Mr. Rondeau was involved in substantial acquisitions of shares to the level that the Congress has said is sufficient to prompt the necessity for giving public notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.939" offset="7179160">And when one says the notice must be given to the company to the exchanges upon which the stock is traded and to the SEC, one has to acknowledge that this notice is really a notice that is flowing to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.777" offset="7250526">It is the public that is involved whether the public be involved in accurately buying shares today or conceivably buying them tomorrow or selling shares today or selling them tomorrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.804" offset="7310608">The failure to give the notice operated to the disadvantage of those people who sold their shares at the time Rondeau was buying --</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence C.Hammond, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1814.397" offset="7360972">That's correct Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.613" offset="7369853">It operated to their disadvantage, just one class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.260" offset="7384377">It operated to the disadvantage of sellers who sold during that time period because if the knowledge had been public that this was going on and that Mr. Rondeau was quickly acquiring shares, that would have a substantial effect on the market place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.841" offset="7450728">It certainly affected or would have affected the judgment of people who buy shares because they look to a company for stability, long term accretions and capital and in fact are abhor getting involved in companies that have internal turmoil or management conflicts, those people would -- could still buy under these circumstances not knowing that there is a potential conflict and I think the Court must keep in mind that it's not the question of whether or not there is or is not an intention at the time, to take over control of the company, that is the real objective of giving the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.647" offset="7613942">It is the potential for the conflict, potential for change in management, potential for corporate operation to continue potential for sufficient market interest to increase stock price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.690" offset="7670157">Those are the things that 13D is aimed to provide publicity for and it is the mere potential that that goes on by virtual one acquiring 5% of the stock of a company that prompts the -- that become into effect and the requisite for giving public notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.876" offset="7746853">It operates to the destruction of management of a company whose obligation it is to ceded information as disseminated to its shareholders and see that their interest are protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.044" offset="7799515">And when the instance arises that it suddenly discovers, late although, excuse me, late -- somewhat belatedly someone is involved in buying stock, it starts passing the information out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.930" offset="7855104">It then must get involved in litigation as counsel says because litigation is probably one of the only vehicles by which people can be required to conform to the law and that is a substantial destruction from the operation of a company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.822" offset="7910693">All of these things flow from violation of 13D.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.774" offset="7926471">Now, some members of this class or one of these classes are clearly identifiable and perhaps the damages that flow to them are easily discernable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.074" offset="7967640">You can for instance take a look at the market and come to some -- come to some conclusion as to what the level of damages as to someone who sold it not knowing that this was going out or bought not knowing this was going out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.121" offset="8035871">But when you come to the issue of whether or not someone who got into the market at later date not knowing and the stock never fluctuated in price, what his injury is or the man who bought because he was looking for stability and then finds a company that is correct in turmoil and has all kinds of considerations as to when you should sell and whether or not he should get out, tax considerations, other considerations, this people are also injured and I think that's one issue that gets to the question or these are facts that get to the question of whether or not irreparable injury is really required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.184" offset="8192084">Now I would like to say on that I do not think that irreparable injury in the classic sense is required in order to prompt the initiation and attainment of relief in this kind of case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2133.784" offset="8638464">I think that one must gradate the kind of ultimate result as this commencer with the wrong doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.820" offset="8674617">And this case I think the Seventh Circuit struck a very heavy balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.275" offset="8692485">Getting back for a few moments to the issue of whether or not the balance is really appropriate, I think that regardless of the level of conspiratorial intentional violation that counsel seems to think is essential for any kind of relief, what the Seventh Circuit in fact said was there is this much damage perpetuated, there's much mischief prompted by careless, abandoned and disregarded the laws in the securities field as there can be by a virtue of an intentional violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2280.242" offset="9224338">The benefit to achieve is if you do comply and you advise the market that you are acquiring and that you have some information and there is -- there maybe a tender offer or proxy 3812 that people who sell their stock suddenly are not very wind to sell it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.970" offset="9295287">At least they're not going to sell the prices they were formally able to sell that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2440.004" offset="9863398">I think that the Seventh Circuit came to the conclusion that regardless of how you view this violation, it requires some sort of responsible response and that's on that basis, the Seventh Circuit gave the response which it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.735" offset="9950333">I think that it's essential when one recognizes in this 4110 the manner in which shares can be held that it is essential to give some deference to the manner in which securities violations are pursued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.115" offset="10043852">The SEC certainly would have a great deal of difficulty in pursuing violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.523" offset="10069452">As a matter of fact, about the only time a violation truly gets called to the detention of the SEC would be when a filing occurs and the filing is erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.948" offset="10107173">The only other instance would be if a company became aware of the violation and made its call and determined that the violation had occurred and let the SEC and the SEC would have to pursue all of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.020" offset="10163493">Decisions of the Court from this country and Courts of Appeals have said that the companies are acting in the capacity of private attorneys general in pursuing violations that occur in the Securities Law and that should not be discouraged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.542" offset="10233501">The private attorneys general are the only ones, the companies who really have the best opportunity to perceive when violation occurs because it is on their transfer books ultimately that the recordation of the violation takes place, perhaps and I say perhaps because in this sophisticated days, people very often do not hold their stock in their own name, they hold them in street names.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.142" offset="10347917">And if one holds them in the street names, even then it's very difficult to ascertain when a violation occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.292" offset="10376547">In this particular instance, Mr. Rondeau did not use street names although he used multiple corporations and foundations for acquisition of stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.178" offset="10412074">Counsel says that he held 34,000 in his own name but 34,000 is less 5% and as a matter of fact, in the first communication that took place between Mr. Sholtons and Mr. Rondeau, the conversation was that he intended to by up to 40,000 shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.529" offset="10485530">Very unusual figure for a man to use who has no knowledge of the Securities Law when one recognizes it in this case, 5% is about 300 shares over 40,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.230" offset="10532342">I submit that the facts can paint Mr. Rondeau in several fashions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.799" offset="10562539">And in this particular instance, the Seventh Circuit came to the conclusion that even if you accept the painting that's given by Mr. Beckwith, non-intentional covert conspiratorial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.925" offset="10619068">But nevertheless a businessman who is reasonably knowledgeable to form a law who was about to embark on a million dollar investment in a corporation who did nothing to confer with counsel to determine whether or not he was -- it was necessary that he engage in any kind of protective filings who was aware that this theory before that at 10% he had to file but who went ahead without regard and cause this kind of consternation in the market that under those circumstances that some relief should be afforded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.630" offset="10777893">If you do not grant relief under circumstances such as that, there is no deterrent to one who attempts to utilize the failure to file to his advantage and this particular case as I indicated, it did work to Mr. Rondeau's advantage.</text>

            <text syncTime="3583.659" offset="14437961">Mr. Justice Powell, I have empurple of your question to my colleague Mr. Hammond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.946" offset="14463143">Section 13D is not designed to promote management stability which is phrase used repeatedly in argument and in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.857" offset="14502849">In fact there is no public policy that says a stable management is necessarily a good management or beneficial management.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.186" offset="14532106">And indeed, it maybe to the advantage of shareholders to permit a large influential stockholder like Mr. Rondeau to exercise his rights and see that the corporation is better managed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3627.019" offset="14611414">His lurking presence, effective lurking presence maybe helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.540" offset="14629491">Now so Mr. Justice Rehnquist, on the factual matter, I call your attention of the Court of Appeals decision which is reported on page 169 of the appendix where they say having considered all circumstances concerning Mr. Rondeau's violation of 13D giving a fact to specially to the District Court's findings in Mr. Rondeau and the other defendants did not engage an intentional covert and conspiratorial conduct in failing to timely file with 13D and was on a company by tender offer or proxy solicitation, we instruct this District Court so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.333" offset="14776717">Had the Circuit Court considered other facts it seems to me they would have had to remand for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.926" offset="14799078">Four judges have considered these factual arguments and have rejected and there is no indication that the Seventh Circuit accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.525" offset="14829484">Four years have gone by since this technical -- I submit technical violation occurred in the spring and summer of 1971, if management has been destructed four years, it's by virtue of its own conduct, not by virtue of Mr. Rondeau.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.926" offset="14895104">So far as the arguments that classes have been damaged in whatever manner whether it's out of the blue or in any other way, I submit those arguments are directed primarily to the question of violation or standing and not remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.558" offset="14957589">The issue here is remedy not whether management can sue or should sue or whether somebody might be injured or will be injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.696" offset="14990190">The question is what do we do now four years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.433" offset="15005132">The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeal decision I submit will lead to abuse in our circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.146" offset="15027911">It will turn this act that was designed to provide fair rules of conduct in tender offer situations into a weapon that can be used by management to neutralize a shareholder that may effectively control -- may effectively gain control or affect the management of a corporation and that's good, that's not bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.116" offset="15115786">So far as the benefit to Mr. Rondeau and not filing, it was well known that he was purchasing stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.339" offset="15140760">Mr. Forester wrote to the directors on May 7, that's just about 30 days after Mr. Rondeau made his first purchase calling their attention to the fact that Mr. Rondeau was purchasing stock and I believe the record shows that Mr. Forester and Mr. Sholtons started tabulating his purchases virtually from the first day that they appeared on the registrar of the corporation and that was in about April 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.780" offset="15250474">The market price of the stock as suggested, he might have benefited because he was buying in a stable market even after he filed this 13D, there was a day or two when the market blipped up, there's no indication there was any trading at the higher level because its over the counter but then it's settled back at the same level, so but for this lawsuit, Mr. Rondeau could have continued purchasing after the 13D at approximately the same level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.450" offset="15353187">In conclusion Your Honors, I submit that it is appropriate for this Court to consider the remedy aspect here and to put Section 13D and the Williams Act back in the proper context in the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.971" offset="15411284">Thank you.</text>
