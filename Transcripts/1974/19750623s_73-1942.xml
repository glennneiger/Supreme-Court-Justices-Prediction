            <text syncTime="19.633" offset="78472">A Jacksonville, Florida ordinance, directed at move in -- at drive-in movie theaters prohibits the exhibition of films which contain nudity.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.198" offset="124761">The ordinance was sustained by the Florida courts and came to us on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.786" offset="147122">As we conclude that the ordinance infringes First Amendment rights, we reverse the decision of the Florida court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.500" offset="189962">This is an obscene -- this is not an obscenity ordinance as it proscribes the showing of any nudity however innocent or educational.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.116" offset="232385">It nevertheless was depended on three grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.162" offset="244611">One, as preventing offense to persons on public streets, two, as protecting children from scenes of nudity, and three, as a traffic measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.125" offset="292467">In our view, the ordinance is both overbroad and underinclusive when tested against its specified purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.856" offset="327367">The intrusion on the privacy of passersby is limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.729" offset="346906">The legitimate state interest in protecting children from obscenity is not furthered and if designed as a traffic measure, many things such as scenes of horror and violence are more likely to distract than many of the fleeting shots of nudity that abide by this ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.339" offset="433319">In sum, although a city or a state has a legitimate interest that would support a non-discriminatory ordinance regulating drive-in theaters this ordinance unduly infringes upon First Amendment rights with little prospect of furthering any of the legitimate state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.352" offset="517329">Mr. Justice Douglas filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.585" offset="530286">The Chief Justice filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Rehnquist joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.875" offset="551497">Mr. Justice White also filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
