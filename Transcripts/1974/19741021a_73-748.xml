            <label>Mr. Howard Schulman</label>
            <text syncTime="26.413" offset="209063">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.914" offset="227035">I find myself back again in a return voyage, it appears like in the -- on behalf of Merchant seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.928" offset="255039">It was initially I was here and on behalf of questions of their rights under the Federal Labor Act and we have an additional point today which presented to the Court of the free speech First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.363" offset="316792">We had intended to devote substantial time to both arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.820" offset="338631">Now, whether on the light of a unfortunate reputation by the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.662" offset="362036">Again, without leave of this Court and submitting an untimely brief as he did in Windward, we then be compelled to devote a little more time to the presumption argument than we had originally contemplated.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.014" offset="423476">Present here as distinguished from the Windward case where in Windward, the claim was by the ship, the foreign ship owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.201" offset="464227">The conduct of the unions there interfered with the ship's contract among it seamen and its internal labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.708" offset="518248">And for that reason, this Court determined that it fell within the parameters of the Benz doctrine that the act was not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.154" offset="555969">Now, we have a totally different picture here.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.745" offset="570389">In this instance, the association of mobile stevedoring employers brought the action in the Alabama State Court alleging almost the verbatim practical provisions of Section 8 (b) 4 of the Act that these pickets had directed their activities to the stevedore employees of the association, caused them to breach their agreements, induce them not to go to work upon this foreign vessel and claimed at that time that therefore they're entitled to an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.630" offset="749902">Now, when we look at both the complaint of the respondent in this case and as an additional respondent, I don't want to forget him, a farmer who has had some produce and claimed that his right to do business was interfered within so far as the Longshoremen wouldn't load his grain aboard the vessel or unload his grain to put aboard the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.325" offset="848645">When we look at it in the final analysis of what has happened in the factual context of this case, you have the Alabama State Court not passing upon their merits in the Windward case of the internal economy of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.672" offset="914056">The foreign seamen there contract with their ship owner but on the contrary, you have the Alabama Court regulating the employer-employee relations existing between the Longshoremen American Association Employer and its employees and the American Seaman Unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.565" offset="1009664">And I say in that respect that this is conduct when you examine the congressional scheme which was left exclusively to the competence of the labor board.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.191" offset="1060133">Now, there are many illustrations of this patent of conduct, it is not unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.466" offset="1085210">There are many areas where under the congressional scheme as determined by this Court and so applied where the underlying dispute, the causes of dispute, the primary dispute is without the competence of the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.382" offset="1152920">Nevertheless, other aspects of the dispute remained within the sole and exclusive authority and I'd like to just comment upon appeal as I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.637" offset="1197955">I think for example, the Broome, Hattiesburg case where in that instance, the Labor Board had determined on a standards of commerce that the parties in that instance did not meet the requirements, the caution for commerce and determined under those circumstances that there was no jurisdiction over the primary dispute, there was no commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.355" offset="1284786">Nevertheless, this Court held in that case that conduct complained of, the secondary conduct within the congressional scheme of regulating a conduct of American employers and American unions where within the exclusive profits of the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.505" offset="1357406">And we've had three cases in maritime to that effect and Mr. Chief Justice may recall one of them, he prepared one of the arguments in the Grain Handlers case against local -- against the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.538" offset="1409546">The first one however comes out of the Fourth Circuit and you get the identical pattern with the Longshoremen in that case and it's the local 1438 NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.319" offset="1448626">The Longshoremen in that particular case were picketing the vessel, claiming political reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.345" offset="1472763">The one of the issues presented there was whether or not the board under those instances because it was a foreign flagship owner had competence to process such a complaint or such a challenge and the circuit held yes and what the conduct there complained of nor the conduct the board was seeking to remedy was not the internal affair of the vessel pointing out clearly, that's what Benz inquiries and McCulloch had stood for at that posture in time, then the contrary, the relationship existing among American employers, among American unions and American workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.190" offset="1616123">Now, the same context came up within the D.C. circuit and in the Seventh Circuit involving Canadian vessels, came out at the same context, one at a preliminary injunction stage and one in enforcement of the board order.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.425" offset="1673070">And in those cases, the unions in both instances took the following position.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.954" offset="1691146">They said “look, the underlying dispute involved here is one involving a Canadian foreign flag vessel, Canadian ship owner for -- where can I endure that distinction quite clearly between a foreign flagship and a foreign ship owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.043" offset="1751542">In that instance --</text>

            <text syncTime="432.770" offset="1834402">That sort of the way --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="howard_schulman" startTime="433.379" stopTime="1173.231">
            <label>Mr. Howard Schulman</label>
            <text syncTime="433.379" offset="1836910">This Court has and also under Rededus (ph), the comments directed by Mr. Justice Harlan and that McCulloch holds that you can't have this evaluation as balancing and nevertheless, the majority -- where dealers majority apparently did not accept that and directed no comments to it and again I assume that they paid attention and disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.169" offset="1920084">Now, I think we're talking about Mr. Chief Justice, the Windward opinion talks about foreign ship owner and I assume when the Court use foreign ship owner it means just there.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.780" offset="1970448">And it's a different issue and it's a different question that's not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.890" offset="1986957">And they may very well pose a different issue and on effect you got a foreign flag vessel constructively by lower American owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.298" offset="2024573">And as many these major petroleum and multi national corporations exist, the Liberia where there was no question and admittedly for their own spokesman that these vessels are American owned directed by Americans under a pledge to be kept that way, constructively Americans and subject to their call and I think their concerns for relationships with respect to what I refer to you formistically as a true foreign ship owner and another, I think it differ but in all candid, I do not --this case, with that particular fact pattern is not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.356" offset="2180786">Now, in addition to maritime and in addition to questions of whether or not the volume of the business keeps a particular employer within the coverage of the act, there are other instances as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.798" offset="2230523">Example, the railroad, this Courts decision in New York Newhaven, local 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.664" offset="2254033">There, the underlying dispute involved there was not within any competence of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.010" offset="2287365">And yet this Court held as another demonstration then under those circumstances, what the complaint of, what are the party complaining up there was this secondary conduct within the competence of the Labor Board and if this was part of Congress's scheme, I think the last illustration, I'm sure there's many more, the last one that I could possibly come across is the agriculture industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.313" offset="2372629">That the agricultural industry is not within the board's competence and nevertheless, there are cases and we cite the Ninth Circuit enforcing the San Francisco labor counsel but not withstanding the dispute with the farm labor, the Chavez group.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.019" offset="2435427">Nevertheless, American union subject to the act, American employers, the Labor Board has jurisdiction, exclusive jurisdiction at least under Garmon, its arguable prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.308" offset="2480567">Now, this is what I see and but what we see what this case is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.661" offset="2510033">The Solicitor General, the Government composes that it doesn't -- the analogy we gave where the authorities doesn't apply and cites Hanna Mining and I think I like to direct a few minutes attention to this Court's holding in Hanna Mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.519" offset="2573458">Hanna Mining case was an attempt by an American officer's union to engage in picketing waters of the State of Wisconsin to compel the supervisors and compel the employer as well to make these supervisors join the unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.922" offset="2655065">And the case came before this Court and to go to Wisconsin Court finding that that conduct was arguably within the can off or the exclusive jurisdiction of the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.855" offset="2702817">Mr. late -- Mr. Justice Harlan made quite clear in that case that the conduct which was sought to be remedy finding no such preemption was conduct which would go unregulated which Congress in its scheme said the Labor Board should not regulate and that to come down with a result and to find that the State Court is preempted by the Labor Board would leave that conduct totally uncontrolled.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.624" offset="2825906">And in that instance, on the -- I think that Mr. Justice Brennan held in his concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.959" offset="2847222">The union there, we're just complaining incidentally there with secondary conduct but the core is a language I think Mr. Justice Harlan used the vital core of the dispute, was the attempt by the engineer's union to organize these people through economic force and that was any of the desires of their member which was not controllable at all, even under the Federal Court particularly in view of Section 8 (b) 7, and the fact that the supervisors I should say are without the structure of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.487" offset="2969370">Now, that is a world's apart totally different analogy of context in any sense of arguing with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.006" offset="3015346">Here, the foreign ship owner, if he has a cause to believe as a remedy in the State Court, we can take whole of any conduct which interferes with an attempt to breech the agreements between the foreign seamen and the foreign ship owner, the articles, the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.291" offset="3100505">And when -- in Hanna Mining, the result as determined by the Wisconsin Court did not permit of that and I am directed to in substance what we are talking about is the congressional scheme, I think we all come back to that again as to what Congress had in mind as motivations in purposes this were.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.276" offset="3196426">Congress had in mind that American employers and American unions -- American working men most significantly had certain rights, their accommodations and their adjustments.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.751" offset="3250343">And that 8 (b) 4 encompasses all that legislative history on debate so that not only a certain conduct intended to be prohibited involving neutrals but there is also certain rights protected activity which Congress determined should be exercised by American workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.811" offset="3354624">I find frankly to be subjectively quite along Solicitor General's proposal of what he calls concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.683" offset="3402062">What do you say, but he's asking this Court to do, not withstanding all his legislative history is the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.086" offset="3431737">He says “insofar what affects the secondary conduct as in this case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="837.264" offset="3452426">And you look at page 29 of the appendix of the Alabama Supreme Court's injunction and they don't say a word about the foreign vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.860" offset="3486804">They just regulate my client's conduct and this employer for all vessels, American or otherwise as if this was a typical garden variety Labor Board injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.046" offset="3543542">And the Solicitor General says by concurrent jurisdiction of that regulation, of that secondary conduct should be in effect by force, not under Federal Law though, not like under Section 301 of the Act for breech of contract or Section 303 for damages for violation (Inaudible) where state courts have jurisdiction, concurrent jurisdiction but must deployed federal law, oh no.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.850" offset="3658794">The Solicitor General opts for a situation whereas my friends on the other side get two bites of the apple, not one and maybe other people will get equivalent two bites.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.513" offset="3701426">He says there's concurrent jurisdiction between the Labor Board under one hand to take a look into it to see whether conduct is prohibited or whether it's not violative.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.645" offset="3741968">And on the other hand, it's a right of the party to go to state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.443" offset="3761194">I frankly find this totally at odd with the many decisions of this Court are relative to intent of the act and we're talking about secondary board of conduct and the need for uniformity and Section 10 (a) is command for exclusivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.379" offset="3820857">I find other interest in fact as coming out of it, you could arrive at a situation where peoples such as the respondents here could go into a state court and get relief under state law where there's a yellow lonely guy and do some breech of contracts of other concept for which the top Court of Alabama may affirm and which there's no federal question to come before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.692" offset="3926183">Yet another party goes before the Labor Board and the Labor Board's case comes before this Court and he get it diametrically uphold the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.056" offset="3963591">That's only some of the errors, there's more significant errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.218" offset="3976234">Here, I believe 30 somewhat to coastal stage, were on water in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.458" offset="3993161">I believe they have 30 somewhat interpretations, but then they gave on the states as the impact to secondary boycotts, that would be totally violative at the Congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.205" offset="4032240">How do you similar problems with the Solicitor General's conduct?</text>
            <text syncTime="985.636" offset="4045928">Norris LaGuardia was an intrical part of our labor policy which says federal courts generally are prohibited from issuing injunctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.333" offset="4080724">And yet code of that 1635 and congressional legislative scheme Norris-LaGuardia is to reserve solely to the federal system certain conduct which carries with it that state courts are not to act on it and the same state court absent little Norris-LaGuardia act have no such proscription, we wind up again under this opted for policy coming out at the extreme once again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.297" offset="4192528">And finally, in connection with somebody that appears to me to be similar, our stories is the question of Section 10 (a) in its expressed congressional attempt of ceding the board jurisdiction but it's got to be consistent with the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.479" offset="4253236">There's got to be an agreement consistent with it and the law must be equally applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.557" offset="4273612">And under the Solicitor General's contention, we totally violate each and every one of those terms and provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.018" offset="4307466">I think there is of course an even more significant point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.366" offset="4328887">Mr. Justice Rehnquist in the Windward opinion cited this Courts Lorensen -- Lorensen case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1138.845" offset="4658761">The bill was passed over one merely in a house, rejecting the state department's proposals, overwhelmingly in the senate, the conferees of both houses have met, the reports of the conferees has been acted upon by the house and accept overwhelmingly.</text>

Each and every instance that to me it presents an issue purely legislative and equally significant made by secretary, the secretary of the state as well as other agencies administered government taking the branch to Congress and not accept it, and that to me is a brush appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.911" offset="5295000">Maybe my subjective pleading as in advert to get us a little color but what appear to me and if you've gone to one forum body and you rejected there, it doesn't suit well to look for another suitor or to go to another forum, you go shopping, and I submit and so submit state, I believe this was the solicitor is doing here, doing just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.053" offset="5375561">I see I have just a few moments and I just like to direct a few remarks to First Amendment argument, the free speech argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.937" offset="5411088">The Alabama Supreme Court in talking about the conduct involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.157" offset="5431986">The conduct involved was the same conduct we wind, of the same conduct of national policy action of this which is all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.611" offset="5457795">New picket sending out signs, asking for help and assistance protected jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.541" offset="5477543">Alabama Supreme Court says in approaching that issue that first of all, it has the right not withstanding I submit, first before to the amendment to seize and issue a notice restricting all picketing pending that's looking in to the purpose of objects where the effects may affect the national economy of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.118" offset="5579839">And as I read this, is the prohibited conduct which this Court express, in Thornhil up to Kiff of a blanket provision saying when that affects the national economy of our local area that our state policy is that all injunct or picketing is to be restrained, we know of no such authority to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.641" offset="5677955">I do not think that a state possesses that right on the mere expression that it may affect local economy to stop all free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.692" offset="5730095">That has not given, that is not bought, that is not Hankey and the other cases authorizing labor disputes, state valid policy and the demand open to them for specific conduct to restrict the specific conduct such as anti monopolist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.641" offset="5797909">And I think there's more in this case if we find argument in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.469" offset="5817240">In addition to that, Alabama says, wrongful interference and nothing more, just the two words, wrongful interference, the person's right to do business with the matter of state policy may enjoin picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.395" offset="5876903">I submit or patent in the economy, I submit, that runs directly about this Court's decision in Kiff where the man was engaged in business at his house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.295" offset="5924551">That goes the problem I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.818" offset="5934686">Alabama may not so broadly restrain, have not established the confines, the valid state for the policy assuming the domain is open to them, assuming there's no preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.362" offset="5984841">And finally, we have involved here what I think in the final analysis is Alabama making a finding by its Supreme Court when the District Court and the Local Court made no findings effect and the Alabama Supreme Court in answering objection to that say, well, they must have made certain findings otherwise they wouldn't have issued the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.360" offset="6092779">I guess under those circumstances, we don't need appellate Courts but not withstanding that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.278" offset="6112528">The issue which we have presented there and we enumerated quite bit in our brief is that they've hit upon a personal hope and desire of a very low official who testified under very scheme for cross examination my good friend prompt me corrected it, as to his personal hopes and desires, what he would personally like to see and admittedly have nothing to do with the campaign other than to serve the picket lines and carry the instructions out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.191" offset="6204165">And based upon that, the Court said, the purpose of this picketing may have been to tie up the whole harbor until Congress brought some legislation to bring the whole harbor down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.444" offset="6249200">And I say, under this Courts decision in Grain, we need to search the record to find subsisting facts, essential facts to warrant the restrictions of the First and Fourteenth Amendment should be made in this case and I think when they're made in this case, there is no finding that the conduct of this individual, his own personal hopes and expectations could be charged against the conduct of this committee and his thousands of American seamen was merely exercising a fundamental right.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank McRight</label>
            <text syncTime="1573.451" offset="6397158">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.655" offset="6410010">I quite frankly thought with this Courts issuance of decision in Windward the petitioner's preemption argument wouldn't be urged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.082" offset="6447731">The picketing in Windward was the same as the picketing in Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.282" offset="6464449">It was furtherance the same national program involving the same unions, the same picket signs, having the same effect, using the same leaflets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.192" offset="6508126">The same consequences in Windward as this Court noted in Windward were noted by the Alabama Supreme Court as to the picketing in Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.687" offset="6542085">Was either the force are raised in the internal standards of those vessels or to block those vessels from the use of US ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.376" offset="6572910">And of course this Court held that in Windward, under those circumstances, the picketing was not subject to the jurisdiction of National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.014" offset="6615437">Essentially, the petitioners argued two distinctions between this case and the Houston picketing in Windward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.627" offset="6645844">One, they have apparently abandoned here an oral argument, that is the allegation that the vessels involved who are constructively American owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.217" offset="6680221">So we won't need to talk about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.572" offset="6689625">The other distinction is that although the primary dispute here may not be in commerce, there were secondary effects which are in commerce and which are subject to the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.783" offset="6750542">Of course, in Windward, we were talking about the picketing not being in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.960" offset="6771231">It's the same picketing here that was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.883" offset="6786905">So, this Courts determination that the picketing was not in commerce, certainly should carry some weight beyond the allegation that the primary dispute was not in commerce, and it was the picketing here that was the subject of our complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.918" offset="6847091">The allegations of the state court complaint were against the picketing specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.199" offset="6876139">Paragraphs 20, 21, 22 of the complaint “complained of picketing and other interference directed at the foreign flag vessels and of Mobile.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.811" offset="6918666">So it was the picketing itself that was a basis of the Mobile Steamship Associations complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.647" offset="6941968">The fact that there maybe secondary aspects involved here has pretty well been disposed off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.275" offset="6964433">I think this Court in Hanna versus MEBA indicated that where the primary dispute in that case, a dispute involving efforts to organize supervisors, employees not covered by the National Labor Relations Act, indeed foreign crewmen not covered by the National Labor Relations Act here where the primary dispute was not in commerce as this Court held in Windward, the fact that a state court injunction might in fact regulate some conduct arguably subject -- arguably violative of Section 8 (b) 4, did not prevent the States Supreme Court from -- state court's from acting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.411" offset="7121063">The Court indicated Mr. Justice Brennan in the concurring opinion that the issue was where the Congress had excluded state regulation of picketing outside the coverage of the Act when the picketing also has secondary aspects arguably within the rates of Section 8 (b) 4 and the Court said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.949" offset="7199117">That in that area, federal occupation of the matter is at the minimum and state power is at peak.</text>

            <text syncTime="2377.355" offset="9612831">I don't think it's that much there Your Honor and I do think that it's largely uncontroverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.688" offset="9642088">Certainly, as to the signal effect to the picketing and certainly as to its ultimate purpose, I don't think there's any real controversy of fact over those two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.740" offset="9678346">And I think that with that in mind that this Court applying Hankey where you have a situation that union members were appealing to union deliver, not make deliveries in order to force recognition of a union by self-employed persons that this Court indicated that balance has to be struck and that balance comes to this Court bearing a way title of respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.449" offset="9785135">I would like to say that the petitioner's reference to the amicus brief filed by the -- to the briefs field in the Logan Valley case, a very helpful and in particular would ask the Court if it would to take a look at the amicus brief filed by the AFLCI on that case who appeared as amicus here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.492" offset="9881370">I think they recognize the point that we are making that is that signal picketing, because it's by nature so very coercive can be limit even though the act sought is lawful of itself uncoercive solicitation of that particular act would be constitutionally protected free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.429" offset="9965066">That statement and other statements begin on page 16 of the brief and our very enlightening on the different kinds of picketing and how my friends on the other side of the table view picketing generally in terms of the constitutional context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.476" offset="10033298">I think the real question here, certainly the Alabama policies, the Alabama state docks is a public facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.531" offset="10069452">Certainly the picketing interfered with the operation of that public facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.661" offset="10086066">Their decisions to this Court that indicate that intentional interference with the operation of public facilities maybe constitutionally limited interference with court systems, the jail systems were the subject to the cases of cuts and the appellee decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.971" offset="10155238">Beyond that, these unions by their announced purpose could and would close the ports of this country including the port of Mobile, the only seaport in Alabama to foreign shipping.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.366" offset="10204871">Foreign shipping comprises by tonnage, I think something like 95% of the commerce, foreign commerce to country, something like 70%, 80% of the vessels that call the port of Mobile fly the foreign flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.872" offset="10254817">I think any society acting in itself interest can establish a policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.856" offset="10274774">Indeed Congress could establish a policy if he so wish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.467" offset="10289194">Alabama through its judiciary has recognized that policy that the interference on such a large scale with essential economy of a society can be regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.791" offset="10338513">And the question presented is whether or not the petitioners have a constitutionally protected right to use signal picketing to close the port of Mobile, indeed, the ports of this country to foreign flagship.</text>

            <text syncTime="2586.309" offset="10448645">In response to Mr. Justice Marshall's inquiry as to what the record show as to the purpose and intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.400" offset="10488978">And Mr. Right -- McRight commented that there was really no dispute on it and on page 1 -- 126 A, the question was put to the petitioner's only witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.390" offset="10548955">My hope is to clod up the port of Mobile with foreign ships, Liberian, Panamanian to bring sufficient pressure on the United States Government to do something about the American merchant marine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.390" offset="10588975">That is your intention?</text>

            <text syncTime="2626.866" offset="10610813">This is in the record to me and to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.145" offset="10627950">It's unequivocal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.171" offset="10636100">The witness was a sole witness presented by petitioners as a live witness in the Court in Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.573" offset="10665671">This is the fifth Court that followed along, has been on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.212" offset="10684270">And each Court we go, the higher we go, the lower Mr. Nary goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.428" offset="10709034">He is a -- has been the port agent for the petitioner SIU in the Port of Mobile for 15 years, it is he who called all the coordinating unions together and told them what they were going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.735" offset="10758353">It is Mr. Nary who put the pickets out of the line and told them what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.546" offset="10777579">But when we get to the highest Court in the land, he is reduced to a man of menial murdering vagrant murdering, just been able to find his way in an out of the union hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.231" offset="10832332">This testimony is so damaging that the man has been belittled, and belittled and belittled the higher we go on Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.390" offset="10864933">The time and the place of these pickets are extraordinarily interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.748" offset="10890324">It came at the height of the grain season where the grain must be harvested, it cannot be left out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.421" offset="10921044">These farmers don't have enough storage to store the grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.702" offset="10934209">The only place in South Alabama, Northwest Florida and Mississippi for export grain in the public grain elevator at the state docks in the state of Alabama in Mobile, when that gets stopped up, the grains face in the field and it rots.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.977" offset="11007248">The pickets were put up within minutes of the time that a federal judge in Mobile ordered a sister union, the ILA is back to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.498" offset="11049357">The pickets were put in an isolated place at the state docks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.874" offset="11070882">Information to the public, the only public that was there were the ILA members, the petitioner's sister union members who wouldn't cross their picket lines and load and unload the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.504" offset="11121351">The other element of the public was there where the foreign seamen assumed they wanted to see the signs and who Mr. Nary again testified that that's what we wanted to do, we wanted to see him, we wanted them to start a dispute where there are foreign owners, so that those owners would pay them the equivalent of American wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.948" offset="11215182">This was testimony right in to the Windward case where it was held or noted that the very least that the petitioners in that case, the petitioners in this case would hold to accomplish would be to make the foreign ship owners raise their wage and pay them equivalent wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.331" offset="11288743">The results were dramatic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.044" offset="11299506">The whole port was shutdown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.665" offset="11314030">And when at a time when the only vessels in port were foreign flag, every one of them picketed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.903" offset="11335032">Every one of them, every single of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.368" offset="11340884">That stopped the port, it stopped the Grain Elevator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.432" offset="11353109">It puts the farmer's grain out in the fields to rot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.356" offset="11380799">On the free speech, free speech with pickets is free speech plus and can be regulated by the state within reasonable bounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.172" offset="11420087">Logan Valley tells us that we must not un-deal or interfere with the normal use of public property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.164" offset="11456031">Here, the respondents were denied the use of state docks property entirely, public property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.998" offset="11491349">The decisions are federal decisions, require the Court to balance this freedom of communication, freedom of speech against the states power to reasonably curtail that freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.475" offset="11565223">And this is what the trial court and Mobile did was to balance these competing interest.</text>
