            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">The next case, Ivan Allen Co. against the United States comes to us on certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.786" offset="39079">And it concerns the so-called accumulated earnings tax imposed on most corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.222" offset="72829">This taxpayer, petitioner, the Ivan Allen Company of Atlanta possessed a portfolio of listed and unlisted marketable securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.836" offset="115252">These had been purchased out of earnings in prior years and it so happen that throughout the tax years in question here which are fiscal 1965 and 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.188" offset="160705">The market value of these securities had greatly exceeded their cost to the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.003" offset="184007">During those fiscal years, the taxpayer had undistributed earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.780" offset="203024">And the question is whether in determining -- the question is whether in determining whether those undistributed earnings were improperly accumulated within the meaning of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.665" offset="254642">The securities in the investment portfolio are to be valued at cost to the corporation or whether their marketable figures could be taken to account.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.077" offset="292258">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue of course took the latter position and the taxpayer obviously took the former.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.243" offset="324963">The statute provides a rebuttable presumption that a corporation that has accumulated earnings beyond the reasonable needs of the business does so, the purpose of avoiding the income tax with respect to its shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.177" offset="380656">The Internal Revenue Service applied this presumption and asserted deficiencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.852" offset="399360">They were paid and the corporation filed claims for refund and on the denial of those claims, this litigation was instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.503" offset="433946">The District Court held that the readily marketable securities were to be taken into account at cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.590" offset="458292">Accordingly, it entered judgment for the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.869" offset="471458">The Fifth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.306" offset="481176">We granted certiorari because of an apparent conflict with the case in the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.189" offset="508656">In an opinion filed today, we hold that listed and readily marketable securities owned by the corporation and purchased out of its earnings and profits are to be taken into account not at their cost of the corporation but at their net liquidation value for purposes of the impact of the accumulated earnings tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.732" offset="598831">This is a narrow opinion focusing primarily on the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.811" offset="627148">But accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.528" offset="646060">I'm authorized to say that Mr. Justice Powell has filed a dissenting opinion and is joined therein by Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
