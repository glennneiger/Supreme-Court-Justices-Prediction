            <text syncTime="474.970" offset="2003257">Let me say for the record that they probably could never have entered the United States but we're talking about coming by means of a labor certification, which means that they had obtained a certificate from a labor department saying that they were needed in the American economy because there were no other labors available to fill the specific job to which an employer had sought them.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.290" offset="2116524">They would never have entered the United States because the quota was backed up for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.664" offset="2154036">So, have they had a labor certification, they could not have obtained a visa at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.653" offset="2189981">Now, they're here, having gone through the entire procedure and we're confronted this morning with their right to remain here under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.035" offset="2243480">This Court has faced this particular Section of the statute, Section 241 (f) in the Errico case and made its pronouncement in that specific area that the Government here this morning says that the judgment of the Court should be confined strictly only to quota discussion on the Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.801" offset="2358627">Their claim is that the Reid's are not entitled to the 241 (f), the exception or exemption from deportation because they failed to submit that to inspection they say that this is not an inspection and they say also that they failed because they did not have a Visa.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.603" offset="2457788">The Government says that there are two requirements, that first of all that there be a Visa in the possession of the intending agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.827" offset="2498644">And secondly, that in presenting this Visa at the port of entry, he announced himself as an Alien and then be put through the examination procedure whatever it might be at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.108" offset="2559770">Now, the examination at the port of entry can be either rigid or be perfunctory.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.327" offset="2600730">If a person comes in with a Visa regardless of whether this Visa was obtained legal and without fraud and submits himself at the port of entry to an immigrant -- immigration officer, the immigration officer can do one of two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.375" offset="2688920">He can merely take the man's passport, open it up to the Visa's page, see that it has stamp and feeling assured in his own mind that this is a genuine Visa that is not a forgery or phony, admit him and this would be the entire inspection procedure at the port of entry or he can go to the entire again -- and once again take out the papers, go through it question by question, where were you born, produce the birth certificate to show it and the status of your health, if he wanted to at that time he could require him to have a new physical examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.559" offset="2849625">He could require that any documents which he might have in his possession showing that he would not become a public charged be updated and can do any one of this things that the counsel has already done prior to his arriving at the port of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.099" offset="2915767">Now, for the most part however, examinations at the port of entry are strictly perfunctory.The immigration officer opens the passport, sees the Visa stamped in the passport then if he feels, assured that this is a genuine passport, this is about the sum of it, takes his papers and that's the answer.Now, though we claim here that any person coming into the United States under a claim of US citizenship and meeting the other requirements being otherwise admissible and having in this specific case US children is -</text>

            <text syncTime="2077.678" offset="8414124">I'd like to review the facts very briefly again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.643" offset="8433977">Petitioners who are citizens of British Honduras and married to each other entered the United States at Chula Vista, California which is on the Mexican border by falsely stating that they were citizens of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.089" offset="8503777">The husband arrived in November '68 and his wife followed January of '69 and nine months thereafter she gave birth to her first child and in '71 gave birth to her second child and of course their children are American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.660" offset="8570023">Three years after Mr. Reid's arrival, he was -- they were served with petition to show cause or an order to show cause why they shouldn't be deported because they entered the United States as aliens deportable under 241 (a) (2) as aliens would enter the United States without inspection as aliens claiming being citizens of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.323" offset="8680678">They admitted that they had entered fraudulently by claiming United States citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.795" offset="8706591">They admitted that they had not secured the Visa upon entry and they also admitted that they did not present themselves to the immigration officer for inspections as aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.373" offset="8748910">However, they denied the legal conclusion that they're deportable, contending that Section 241 (f) of the Act waives deportation in the case of aliens otherwise admissible at the time of entry who have procured entry into the United States by fraud or misrepresentation and have close family ties in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.514" offset="8857475">The special inquiry officer upheld the charge that they were deportable and the Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed their appeal claiming that aliens who circumvent the entire Visa issuance process -- inspection process are not eligible for relief under 241 (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.310" offset="8960606">The petitioners then applied for the privilege of voluntary departure and claimed that they would be willing to leave under the conditions and at the time set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.825" offset="9010657">And I might add at this point, Mr. Justice Brennan, this is the point where the special inquiry officer for this purpose found them of good moral character and granted their petition of the -- no special inquiry officer found them of good moral character at the time of entry, it was only in reference to this petition for voluntary departure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2584.097" offset="10439764">She thereafter had an illegitimate child in the United States after having been admitted here in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.835" offset="10486680">In both Scott and Errico, in seeking entry, they not only admitted their alienage that has put the immigration authorities on notice that here we are two aliens coming into the United States, they had to present valid unexpired immigrant Visas and prior to the issuance of that Visa, they both had to complete background questionnaires which went into the -- cover the birth records, military records if anything, criminal record but have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.395" offset="10620949">Not only did they have to do that but they submitted photographs of themselves, they submitted to physical and mental examinations, they were registered and they were fingerprinted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.215" offset="10668283">And they were also investigated by the American consul in Italy in the case of Errico and in Jamaica in the case of Scott, and after that and only after that, a passport was issued and thereafter they both were inspected at the port of entry into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.266" offset="10752397">Now, when it is said by petitioners that the Reid's, the petitioners here were actually inspected at the border, that's impossible because they've admitted that they falsely claim that they were citizens and although we don't have any definition of inspection in the Immigration Act, we can just look at Black's law dictionary and see what inspection means and we can use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.687" offset="10866082">Inspection is a critical examination, a close or careful scrutiny, a strict or prying examination or an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.513" offset="10921462">In the instant case, the petitioners concealed their alienage completely and thus avoided any investigation by the authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.523" offset="10965452">Since citizens coming into the United States do not require to go through inspection, petitioners were able to evade any investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.283" offset="11012472">And Mr. Justice White is perfectly correct when he states that entry concerns aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.334" offset="11052701">The United States' citizen really cannot make an entry under the Immigration and Nationality Act and I turn to Section 1101 of the Immigration and Nationality Act that defines entry as any coming of an alien into the United States, any coming of an alien into the United States from a foreign port of a place or outline possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.831" offset="11162728">Now, the purpose of the two step inspection process that is the Visa issuing on one hand and the inspection at the border is for the main purpose of determining whether or not an alien is admissible or excludable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.398" offset="11228975">And it also serves the purpose of keeping tab on or keeping tract on aliens once they come in to the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.835" offset="11258755">And it is crucial to a lawful admission that an inspection be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.928" offset="11283101">Section 1225 of 8 United Code requires that all aliens shall be examined by immigration officers at the discretion of the Attorney General, but no such mandate was enacted as far as United States citizen is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.189" offset="11352168">Now, let's look at the language of Section 241 (f) itself, which provides impertinent part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.732" offset="11386337">The provisions of this section relating to the deportation of aliens on the ground that they were excludable at the time of entry as aliens, who have procured entry into the United States by fraud or misrepresentation shall not apply to an alien otherwise admissible at the time of entry who is a spouse, parent or child of a United States citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.277" offset="11492498">The Government admits that Section 241 (f) is not intended to apply to petitioners and as the language indicates is quite limited in scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.393" offset="11540982">It doesn't wave all grounds for deportation of persons who are closely related to United States citizens, but only waive deportability on the ground that they were aliens excludable at the time of entry, for having procured documents or entry through fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="3687.909" offset="14854980">And as we have alluded to before, these aliens with the required child or spouse could -- well, he could slip over say in a car, in a trunk of a car and then acquire a spouse or a child and then say I came in as a United State citizen and therefore if petitioner's position would be sustained would be able to say I'm entitled to 241 (f) relief because I lied about being a United States citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.081" offset="14971695">This would produce a severe enforcement problem as is obvious because there are hundreds of thousand of illegal aliens that enter the United States yearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.419" offset="15029060">Another major enforcement difficulty would be presented for those who enter as none immigrants, that is visitors who come in as a none immigrant saying they are going to stay just for temporary period of time and then a year later say well, when I came, I really intended to stay forever so therefore I'm entitled to 241 (f) relief also.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.785" offset="15134490">Indeed, aliens who entered innocently could reasonably press for an equal and absolute right to remain on a theory that it would seem unfair to treat the innocent less favorably and the guilt finally would make a mockery of Congresses numerical limitations which we have to presume were reached after careful study and which also are supposed to tell us how many people this country can safely absorb.</text>
