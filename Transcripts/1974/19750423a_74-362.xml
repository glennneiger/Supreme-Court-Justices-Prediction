            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear arguments first this morning in number 74-362, Intercounty Construction Company against Walter and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.660" offset="150026">Mr. Duncan, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <text syncTime="14.724" offset="162252">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.667" offset="178030">The issue before the Court today arises under the Longshoreman's and Harbor Worker's Compensation Act and involves a construction of Section 22 of that Act which deals with time limitations provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.837" offset="234768">The Act as it now exist in Section 22 provides basically that upon its own initiative or upon an application of any party in interest on the ground of a change in conditions or a determination of a mistake, in fact by the Deputy Commissioner, the Deputy Commissioner may at any time prior to one year after the date of last payment of compensation whether or not a compensation word has been issued, review a compensation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.740" offset="386382">The facts briefly are that Charles Jones was injured while working for Intercounty Construction in July of 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.948" offset="427133">He filed a written claim for compensation benefits in August of 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.408" offset="448972">The insurance carrier voluntarily paid compensation without an award for a period extending into January of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.789" offset="490559">At that point, the carrier filed a notice indicating that the claim would be controverted and it then reduced his benefits by 50%.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.335" offset="536743">An informal conference was held before a claims examiner and the matter was adjourned without any resolution of the claim of Mr. Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.993" offset="575300">In January of 1968, the carrier stopped making compensation payments at all because the statutory limit of $17,280 had been reached except for death cases and permanent total disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.030" offset="635486">More than two years later, Mr. Jones' attorney requested a hearing on his claim for permanent and total disability and it is the carrier's position that by having let that time run, the claim is not barred.</text>

            <text syncTime="153.371" offset="716884">We would say Mr. Justice Brennan that as of January 1969, I believe the date would be the 23rd.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_cduncan_iii" startTime="164.393" stopTime="472.195">
            <label>Mr. John C.Duncan III</label>
            <text syncTime="164.393" offset="760978">Yes Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.203" offset="772159">Now, we rely principally on the Strachan shipping case from the Fifth Circuit cert was denied by those Court in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.174" offset="816044">It appears phonetically as Strachan and I believe the pronunciation is Strachan.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.356" offset="840808">In any event, that case considering the identical issue came to the conclusion that by statutory setup and these regulations implementing it, Congress had events an intention that that compensation payments were to be made voluntarily by the carrier and once payments had stopped, it is incumbent upon the claimant to file a further claim if he sought additional benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.479" offset="953240">Now, it might seem at first forced that the filing of additional claims would be an owner's burden, however, there are numerous cases which have held that simple things such as a telephone call to a Deputy Commissioner or a claims examiner or a claimant complained that the carrier had stopped benefits and a memorandum was then placed in the file were sufficient to constitute a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.575" offset="1061700">There are cases from the benefit's review board for example which have even held that the filing of an attending physician's report is sufficient to constitute the filing of a claim so that we do not believe that the its unreasonable to require a claimant to pursue his claim with some degree of due diligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.225" offset="1136306">We have cited in our petitioner for certiorari at least three other decisions, two of which are unreported which reflect basically the long standing way the Act has been applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.041" offset="1191581">We have the 1942 case in the District of Columbia, the McFadden decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.548" offset="1217599">We have the Okiff decision decided by the Fifth Circuit in 1962 and we have just recently had a decision by an administrative law judge under the amended act all holding that if more than one year runs after the date of last compensation payment, whether or not a compensation order has been issued, the claim is barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.946" offset="1307146">Now, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit disagreed and rejected the holding and struck them.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.941" offset="1335150">They came to the conclusion first of all that Section 22 was ambiguous and then they said it was necessary to look at the legislative history behind Section and that interpretation suggested that Section 22 was only suppose to apply when the Deputy Commissioner had issued an actual compensation order rather than a situation where a claim had been filed, had never been acted on and the time had merely run subsequent there too.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.149" offset="1455940">We believe that the legislative history is capable of more than one interpretation and we suggest that the Court of Appeals respectfully was in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.884" offset="1522918">I believe that is useful to go to the legislative history as it existed in 1927.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.475" offset="1585298">This is found at page 16 and 17 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.146" offset="1619989">After the Act was initially enacted, the U.S. Employees Compensation Commission which was charged with overseeing the Act complained that there were difficulties arising because by the time the award had seized, the Deputy Commissioner no longer had any power to do anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.423" offset="1713089">The man would get his money and the Deputy Commissioner couldn't change it even if there were some reason why he should change it and therefore, they suggested that there should be some amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.233" offset="1752273">Now, in appendix reference 33, we find and this is taken from the Court of Appeal's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.712" offset="1774216">We find the proposed recommendations of the U.S. Employees Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.112" offset="1819773">Now, you will note that they are limiting this situation strictly to a situation where a Deputy Commissioner is reviewing a compensation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.147" offset="1867943">They are not limiting it with any time framework at all so that what they have proposed in effect is the Deputy Commissioner without regard to any time limitation may review a compensation order and he may issue a new compensation order or may make a change by virtue of a compensation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.471" offset="1953207">All of these of course requiring an action by the Deputy Commissioner with respect to a formal adjudicatory compensation order.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="472.195" offset="1992182">This Section 22 on page 33 of the Appendix was proposed but never enacted, is that correct?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_cduncan_iii" startTime="478.740" stopTime="648.322">
            <label>Mr. John C.Duncan III</label>
            <text syncTime="478.740" offset="2018304">Yes Mr. Justice Stewart, that's correct, and I think it is significant because we then go to Section 22 as it was actually enacted which would be found at page 21 of the Government's brief and I think if we compare what was done with what was proposed, we see that there are significant differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.570" offset="2109628">First of all, they indicate that the Deputy Commissioner may at any time prior to one year after the date of last payment of compensation that was not in the proposal from the U.S. Compensation Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.198" offset="2172113">It also indicates that he may review a compensation case as oppose to review a compensation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.745" offset="2206386">So, we feel it is very significant that what was enacted was not what was proposed and as a matter of fact, the House and the Senate reports for the 1934 amendments indicate that the eventual enactments of 1934 were as a results of meetings and compromises between the employee's Unions and the employer's ship building organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.649" offset="2309935">So that we do not have a situation where the U.S. Employees Commission makes recommendations, these are immediately adopted by Congress and then we take off from there.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.857" offset="2342849">We have a meeting between the interested parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.931" offset="2355075">We have a compromised.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.488" offset="2361344">We then have an enactment which is not at all similar to what was proposed by the U.S. Employees Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.352" offset="2388825">Now, I also think that it is helpful to look at some of the testimony and some of the legislative history after 1934 because in 1938, we had another amendment to Section 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.082" offset="2447653">Now, the problem that arose after the 34th amendment was simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.254" offset="2464371">There was no provision with regard to a situation where a Deputy Commissioner had rejected a claim for him to review it again and so amendments were proposed which were eventually enacted in 1938, which would allow a Deputy Commissioner even after he had rejected a claim within one year to review the situation to see if he had made a mistake of fact or if there had been a changed in condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.712" offset="2558203">Now, on July 31st 1935 and this is House subcommittee number 3 on House Report 8293, 74th Congress First Session, which is also in reference generally in the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.217" offset="2632286">We have testimony from Louis Dolby who is general counsel for the U.S. Employees Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.741" offset="2662379">At page 14 of the House Subcommittee report, we have the following discussion about these proposed amendments.</text>

            <text syncTime="655.968" offset="2727267">Mr. Dolby indicates Section refers to the amendment made last year involving Section 22 of the Longshoreman's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.048" offset="2759555">He is then asked by Mr. Emmanuel Seller, "where does that limitation appear in the original act?"</text>
            <text syncTime="670.089" offset="2783692">"Mr. Dolby: That is in Section 5 of the mandatory Act of May 26, 1934 amending Section 22 of the original Act."</text>
            <text syncTime="679.604" offset="2821831">It was amended last year so as to provide for a reopening by the Deputy Commissioner within a year after the last payment of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.963" offset="2859238">Now, the government's position is that the Deputy Commissioner has to issue a formal compensation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.793" offset="2886510">Our position is that regardless of whether a compensation order is issued or not, the time begins to run within one year from the date of last compensation payment.</text>

            <text syncTime="791.011" offset="3267375">Now, as long as the money is continuing to be paid to the man, he can either make a request for a formal hearing because the amount he is receiving is inadequate or he can sit back and be satisfied with it.</text>

            <text syncTime="933.333" offset="3836740">The Government's position is that if a man files his claim within one year and the carrier keeps on making payments and eventually at some point in time, the man becomes dissatisfied with the rate at which he's paid and the man simply has to say I want a hearing and he can go back to day one and then run this out for x number of years and we think that this is not consistent with the purpose of the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1004.609" offset="4121788">Typically, what happens as in this Strachan shipping case, a recommendation is issued and this is set out in the form of a letter to the carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="1227.805" offset="5014549">This case turns on the meaning of a single clause in Section 22 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.072" offset="5035656">The Clause appears to mark off a period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.037" offset="5047568">It reads prior to one year after the date of the last payment of compensation, whether or not a compensation order has been issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.528" offset="5081527">Petitioners argued that because this clause refers to time, it must be the time within which an injured employee must file a piece of paper to prevent some effect on his claim for compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.678" offset="5134085">We agree with the petitioners to this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.313" offset="5144639">Any application for relief pursuant to Section 22 must be filed within the time established by that clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.105" offset="5175777">The more difficult question is who is required to file that piece of paper?</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.445" offset="5197197">We submit that the only people required to file within the time limit established by that clause are those who seek what the section title of Section 22 says it is about, a modification of an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.261" offset="5256443">Petitioner's argument rest on the premise that because some employees must file within the established time, then all employees must do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.822" offset="5290611">Nothing in the statute supports that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.255" offset="5304404">The more accurate reading of the section is that those who seek to modify an award or a compensation order on the grounds of mistake of fact or change in circumstances must file under Section 22 within one year after the date of the last payment of compensation, whether that compensation was paid with or without an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.484" offset="5389354">But those who seek not modification but an initial adjudication of a claim timely filed long ago need not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.500" offset="5425403">They are entitled to at least one adjudication by virtue of that claim and the respondent in this case filed a timely claim less than a mount after his injury.</text>
