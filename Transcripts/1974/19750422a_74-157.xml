            <label>Mr. Simon H. Rifkind</label>
            <text syncTime="44.963" offset="283251">And may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.784" offset="294536">This case is here by way of the petition for certiorari, which brought up for review the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.349" offset="344795">That court had reversed a judgment dismissing the complaint filed herein for want of subject matter jurisdiction in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.205" offset="400175">The respondents in this case who are the plaintiffs in the court below, are a number of residents of a residential development called Co-op City located in the borough of the Bronx in the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.582" offset="481677">These respondents purport to represent a class to wit all of the owners of apartments in Co-op City, which is a giant development and contains more than 15,000 homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.147" offset="555969">The suit was generated by the said circumstance to which we've all been recently exposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.085" offset="583764">Namely that there was an escalation in the cost of the maintenance of the apartments which the defendants had -- respondents had acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.364" offset="632874">And the proffered basis for federal jurisdiction was the allegation that the petitioners had violated the securities laws to the respondent's detriment.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.130" offset="679894">The complaint itself consisted I believe of 13 counts of which ten were state related claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.053" offset="719600">One was a 1933 Act violation and the same facts were alleged as a 1934 violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.559" offset="749589">And then there was one claim against the state and the state agency I believe under the Civil Rights law.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.636" offset="777906">And the central question which the case brings up for review is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.528" offset="797445">Did the Congress in the securities laws intend to reach the transaction which underlies this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="183.023" offset="835480">And that transaction, I shall of course describe.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.015" offset="851466">We assert the negative of that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.911" offset="867035">In other words, that Congress had no such intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.352" offset="880828">And our argument will rest on three pedestals and I believe that each of them would support the conclusion we are here to contend.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.806" offset="926595">First that this transaction related to homes not to securities and not to investments.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.816" offset="970585">Secondly that this is a transaction to which commercial considerations and profit possibilities are roughly alien and therefore not within the realm of congressional concern at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.246" offset="1048325">And lastly, we are dealing here with a state created welfare plan in which the state selected and conferred upon a group of its beneficiaries, a group of its citizens, various benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.736" offset="1146337">And as far as I can read the history of congressional intention, I find that Congress has indicated no interest in penetrating this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.043" offset="1195551">We start therefore in narrating our story with the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.026" offset="1235466">Acting through its legislature, the State of New York became concerned with the plight of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.312" offset="1268590">This was in the early 60s, the flight of the urban middle class, the blight of the inner city slum, the decay of the housing inventory in the big cities, the high cost of replacement of dwellings making safe and clean dwellings unattainable by wage earners and other people of low modest income.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.502" offset="1377364">Certainly, an area of governmental concern which I am sure this Court has heard of many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.242" offset="1408293">And the state determined to make a massive contribution towards the alleviation of the conditions I have described.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.795" offset="1442565">Its concern, the state's concern, was with homes and dwelling places for its residents and citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.977" offset="1471300">Not securities and not investment opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.840" offset="1490735">New York passed a law called the Mitchell-Lama Law, which contained various provisions for variety of possibilities, but with respect to the subject that we're concerned with, I will say that it created first a regulatory agency which has applied into Co-op City has provided a system of supervision and regulation vastly more pervasive than any system of regulation that we are familiar with say in the utility field or the banking field or the airplane field or any of the normal objects of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.001" offset="1651336">And I believe I state correctly that my learned adversaries agree with me that this was a very pervasive system of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.572" offset="1689684">And of course there was a very good reason for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.139" offset="1699924">The state was going to provide massive benefits to those who are going to be the beneficiaries of this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.099" offset="1731793">It provided the means for the obtaining of the money necessary, or the bulk of the money necessary for the creation of this new housing which it contemplated.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.678" offset="1794069">The state was offering to the prospective members of Co-op City whom it selected the following benefits among others.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.656" offset="1837955">First, savings regularized from the availability of construction and acquisition costs at very low cost, because the state agency could raise that money by tax exempt obligations of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.146" offset="1919979">I need hardly say that that represents an enormous fraction of the cost of housing, the cost of the money used in construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.422" offset="1957073">Then there were savings conferred upon the members of this cooperative by the reduction or abatement of real estate taxes to the extent of 80% thereof, again, a very enormous benefit in the maintenance of these properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.870" offset="2046830">And then, with the collaboration of a philanthropic foundation called the United Housing Foundation, which I shall describe later, savings became possible in Co-op City by the elimination of the promoters' profit, the entrepreneurs' profit, the builders' profit and the managers' profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.033" offset="2143483">All of those were eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.279" offset="2156440">And then the cost overall was spread over a period of 40 years, thus making the annual burden a very modest one indeed plus other benefits that I mentioned some of which, I mentioned in my brief, but are relatively smaller in proportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.086" offset="2231672">It was all of these together that made it possible to do what seems like a miracle today to be able to sell apartments at the price of $450.00 per room, a four-room apartment for $1,800.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.623" offset="2293844">Anyone who has purchased a cooperative apartment knows that that is one of the miracles of the age.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.025" offset="2323519">Now, as I have said, Co-op City was sponsored by the United Housing Foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.677" offset="2366046">This foundation is composed of a group of labor unions well known for their progressive policies, like the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, the International Ladies Garment Workers Union whose record of performance of this area is well-known.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.265" offset="2444413">Housing cooperatives, civic leaders all volunteers who furnished to this project the sense of community involvement who furnished it the enriching advice of knowledgeable, distinguished and dedicated citizen and whose standing in the community was such that they were able to had a little lubrication to the wheels of the bureaucracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.153" offset="2571995">And perhaps more important than any of these to ensure the generating idea, the idealism behind this entire project, namely the ideal of a community of home owning neighbors democratically managed, nondiscriminatory in style endowed with the humane amenities in the artistic and spiritual fields of community of homes and a community of homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.729" offset="2718281">Now this was not the first experience of the United Housing Foundation in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.292" offset="2740537">It had a long record of success in promoting and creating housing projects similarly endowed with this spiritual concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.565" offset="2785677">And on my brief, I cite quite a number of famous ones that are extent in the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.319" offset="2808665">And so it was that a city housing something like 50,000 people was built on what a previously been a playground in the northern part of the Bronx.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.596" offset="2857775">And it took a very considerable period to do it, from 1964 to 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.119" offset="2887868">And during that period, I need hardly say that costs were climbing.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.244" offset="2908348">Every other index of our economy showed a similar climb in the sense of inflationary costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.532" offset="2941471">Ultimately the project cost $422 million considerably in excess of the original estimates.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.880" offset="2982849">And of these $420 million, the state agency furnished 92.26%, and I want to emphasize again that not only did the law specify the classes of members who might live in this cooperative, namely the applicants have to show that their earnings were not in excess of six times the estimated maintenance charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.158" offset="3120044">But the very individuals who are accepted for membership in this coop have to be approved by the state authorities, certainly not an aspect which is normally found in the sale of investment securities or speculations.</text>

            <text syncTime="771.345" offset="3188799">What were the criteria for approval by the state authorities in addition to the income levels of the applicants?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="simon_h_rifkind" startTime="776.414" stopTime="785.782">
            <label>Mr. Simon H. Rifkind</label>
            <text syncTime="776.414" offset="3209070">There were benefits conferred upon the aged, upon veterans, upon the disabled and things of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.771" offset="3238431">Those were given preference.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="785.782" stopTime="787.178">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="785.782" offset="3246477">By regulation or statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="simon_h_rifkind" startTime="787.178" stopTime="1345.613">
            <label>Mr. Simon H. Rifkind</label>
            <text syncTime="787.178" offset="3252120">By the practices of the regulatory agency and under its regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.670" offset="3278033">Now, I come to a central feature of this entire transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.721" offset="3310216">There was one concept that was excluded from every phase of this enterprise, the concept of commercialism and the corollary concept of profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.326" offset="3356714">This applied at all stages of the transaction and not only to the one which is most directly relevant to the question before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.103" offset="3395793">For instance, members of Co-op City could receive no dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.383" offset="3424946">Now I know that my learned friend says that they could under a Section of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.560" offset="3449605">He misreads the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.169" offset="3456084">That Section deals with rental properties by private builders but who have the right to have limited profit returns, not to Co-op City.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.586" offset="3505716">The court below said that there might be a rebate on the rental if the cost of maintenance was less than was estimated.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.564" offset="3541661">That is true since the cost of maintenance in a cooperative is shared by all the members of the cooperative, and is based on an estimate if at the end it turned out that the estimate was excessive, the excess is turned back to those who have provided it.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.683" offset="3606131">I don't call that a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.763" offset="3622431">They could sell the homes that they had acquired but for no more than the cost at which they paid for it, $450 a room, not a dollar more could they get for their homes no matter how much land values or building values may have escalated in the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.551" offset="3713546">And not only that, they have to sell their homes if they move from the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.817" offset="3734653">It was only a home for their personal residences and that of their surviving spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.659" offset="3758059">But if for any reason they wanted to move out of the Co-op City, they had to offer their apartments, their homes for sale to the corporation -- to the coop corporation or to a qualified new buyer at the price at which they bought.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.641" offset="3837889">Not only were they not promised any profits, in the literature which announced this project, they were told in words loud and clear that there could not be any.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.501" offset="3893373">Now I move up the scale away from the cooperators upward.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.619" offset="3909883">The United Housing Foundation, which was the sponsor of the project was formed under a statute in New York called the not for Profit Corporation Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.881" offset="3954918">It could make no profit because under the statute of its creation, it was forbidden to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.556" offset="3981563">The construction was done by a wholly owned subsidiary of United Housing Foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.458" offset="4009253">And while that was organized as an ordinary corporation, since its stockholders could make no profit, namely the United Housing Foundation, there would be no point in the subsidiary earning any profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.933" offset="4067140">The subscribers were not offered tax deduction as an inducement in the sense that tax shelters are marketed around the street as this Court well knows, where tax shelters are offered as a form of investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.614" offset="4133804">That was not the approach here because there were no such possibilities, except for the modest tax deduction which is available to every homeowner on the interest of his mortgage and on the taxes which he contributes to the -- to his community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.356" offset="4200782">They were not offered any significant outside income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.811" offset="4230666">That is this was not a project where in addition to homes, there was a vast shopping center attached to it from which the people could hope to derive substantial speculative profits, because had that happened the law would not have permitted this project to be financed under the statute at which I have referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.894" offset="4306944">All they were offered and all that these people received was the opportunity to own a home, and that only so long as they lived in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.984" offset="4355323">And if they have to part with it, they could enjoy no form of capital appreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.197" offset="4384162">Now membership in this cooperation was memorialized in two instruments, two writings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.259" offset="4412374">One, an occupancy agreement, so-called but actually reads very much like an ordinary lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.837" offset="4450722">And secondly, an instrument which was called a share of stock, but differing in many ways from the conventional one especially in the very fact that it could not be sold, could not be authenticated, couldn't be transferred, couldn't be given away and with which you have would to part once you cease being the occupant of the apartment which you had bought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.743" offset="4546330">Now both the District Court and the Court of Appeals have very meticulously expressed their avoidance of entertaining any opinion on the underlying merits of the controversy between the plaintiffs and the defendants or between the petitioners and respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.493" offset="4665344">I have observed that my good learned friends have extensively argued the merits of the case in their briefs, but I shall not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.809" offset="4702647">I shall rely on the proposition that the only question before this Court is whether this controversy belongs in a federal forum under the securities laws, or whether it belongs in the state forum under laws adequate for that purpose in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.662" offset="4761997">The district judge made this comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.972" offset="4775267">“It is well to know that the outset of this inquiry that it is the fundamental nonprofit nature of this transaction which in this court's view, is the insurmountable barrier to plaintiffs claim in the federal court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.830" offset="4838693">And we agree with that expression and hope to win favor for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.450" offset="4869204">Our claim is a very narrow one actually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.054" offset="4887594">Our central point is that Congress did not intend to bring within the ambit of the securities laws an enterprise devoted to the purchase of homes a state dominated enterprise with philanthropic and community participation to which the notion of profit is utterly foreign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.331" offset="4984665">A project pursued without the profit motive promoted without profit inducement and shared by its beneficiaries without the any expectation of gain, and the history, the legislative history suggests to me that that is not what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.039" offset="5059480">Because the evils against which these securities laws were written are still sufficiently vivid so that most of us can remember them from actual experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.315" offset="5108590">Predatory financial practices in the securities markets, stock market price manipulation, luring of small investors by false promises of easy wealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.728" offset="5166268">In short, I submit that the realm of congressional concern was the speculation and investment realm and its identifying flag was the promise or expectation of profit, and one cannot read in my opinion the legislative history of either the 1933 or the 1934 Act without coming to that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.091" offset="5255711">The District Court read that history accurately when it concluded that Congress did not intend to sweep into the ambit of the Federal Securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.730" offset="5290297">State encouraged nonprofit transactions made pursuant to a state emergency housing law, all three elements that I've mentioned available only to state residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.750" offset="5342333">Now, in reaching a contrary conclusion, I believe that the Court of Appeals was in error and I should like to identify its errors into three categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.661" offset="5389981">First, it was, I will finish this sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.200" offset="5412133">It was moved by a literal application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.025" offset="5423522">It misread this court's illumination of the meaning of investment contract, and I believe it misread the securities guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.639" offset="5457899">I'll stop at this moment and if I have some time later I will answer in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.641" offset="5477961">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1356.620" offset="5529893">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.948" offset="5539192">Let me emphasize at the outset that we support completely the position of the petitioners in Number 147 that the Congress did not contemplate, including within the purview of the 1933 and 1933 Securities Acts, shares in the membership of a publicly aided cooperative housing cooperation whose primary objective was the furnishing of housing accommodations to persons of limited income who were prohibited under the general terms of the statute authorizing the construction of Mitchell-Lama housing, from selling those shares for a profit or for the expectation of a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.494" offset="5745351">I shall confine my argument however to the point upon which the state and the state's Housing Finance Agency obtain certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.534" offset="5785475">That neither the state nor the state's Housing Finance Agency are subject to suit in the federal courts for the relief demanded in this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.009" offset="5839391">Now, just as a matter of fact that it been references in Judge Rifkind's argument to supervision by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.386" offset="5876903">Supervision the state has been through the State Commissioner of Housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.822" offset="5902712">State Commission of Housing has been the agency of the state that supervised the construction and supervises the management of this project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.592" offset="5957778">The state financing agency is an agency which has supplied the money to the extent of the 92% that was necessary by the sale of bonds to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.916" offset="6019009">It is a different agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.340" offset="6032697">As to the state itself, we submit that its claim of immunity and the same claim would be applicable to the State Commissioner of Housing if that state agent had been made a party of defendant of this litigation, and the State Commissioner of Housing has never been sued or named as a defendant in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.357" offset="6136769">We submit that this claim of immunity from suit is sustainable and should have been sustained under this Court's decisions in Edelman against Jordan and Employees against the Missouri Public Health Department.</text>

            <text syncTime="1599.940" offset="6503111">But the difficulty with that particular complaint is directed against an agency which is purely a financing agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.209" offset="6584195">An agency which has supplied the money with which this particular project was built, and so far as I can imagine, I don't see how any sort of reasonable construction could lead to a cause of action against an agency, and this is something that goes to the merits and because it goes to the heart of the case as against this agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.265" offset="6704462">No possible cause of action, it seems to me, could be reasonably predicated against the state agency which furnished the money which made this project feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.909" offset="6762977">These plaintiffs would have no place to live in if this money had not been furnished despite the increases in costs that occurred that compelled the furnishing of more money by the State Housing Finance Agency than to have been contemplated or expected in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.224" offset="6876244">That applies only to this single cause of action against the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.214" offset="6900276">Now, the opinion by Judge Rehnquist in the Edelman case came down on a period that was just shortly after the briefs had been submitted in this case by counsel before the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.331" offset="7052727">The Edelman opinion was not noticed at all in the opinion by the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.940" offset="7083133">And we feel that so far as the state itself is concerned, so far as the state supervising agency is concerned, the Commissioner of Housing, there would be no basis for assuming that there had been either any waiver of immunity or any consent by the action of the state in sponsoring this project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.938" offset="7243107">Housing was a field in which the State of New York was intensely interested long before the Securities and Exchange Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.326" offset="7288665">Actually one of the limited dividend projects that was connected in some way with this same sponsoring agency, the amalgamated houses was setup on 1928, people were actually living in amalgamated houses in 1927, Christmas of 1927.</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.992" offset="7847372">The sole securities issue on this appeal is whether 1,312,128 shares of common stock publicly offered by wide distribution through the mails to 15,372 separate purchasers for more than $32,800,000.00 in cash paid by these purchasers constitutes securities under the federal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.735" offset="8010271">Of the thousands of decisions involving alleged frauds in the sale of stock which have been rendered by the federal courts during the past 40 years, there is not a single case which supports the defendant's contention that common stock does not come under the protection of the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.077" offset="8127718">The reason that the defendants cannot cite a single case in which common stock was held not to be a security is that this Court as far back as 1943 settled this issue in the Joiner case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.569" offset="8205667">It mandated that the specific term “stock as a matter of law is a security”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.126" offset="8243911">And it also held that were as here, the case involved “a share of stock” the plaintiff need only offer “the document itself” to prove that it is a security and thereby establish jurisdiction under the Federal Securities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.184" offset="8328129">Now the defendants concede here that the common stock is so designated par value $25.00 a share that appears at the UH brief, page 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.005" offset="8387375">But they urge that these shares denominated as common stock are something different than what they are represented to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.583" offset="8429693">And even this, in the Joiner case, this Court disposed of such convoluted reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.976" offset="8455293">This Court held that in the enforcement of the securities laws, offerings “will be judged as being what they were represented to be.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2199.123" offset="8899897">I think that will be better addressed here on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.837" offset="8918706">The court below has been chastised by the defendants for being literal, because it followed the instruction of this Court in Joiner case and the statute fortunately is explicit and lucent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.103" offset="8975757">And in this admirable sense, it is literal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.234" offset="8984325">Stock is a security and so it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.553" offset="8997595">To cavil with such legislative clarity is unwittingly or otherwise to distort the statute's true meaning in order to avoid its clear application to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.429" offset="9045138">Now 24 years later, this Court reexamined and reaffirmed the Joiner case, and that was of course in the Tcherepnin case that Your Honor referred to, which provides a rare instance of a case remarkably similar in fact to our case, and at which the court rejected the same contentions as the defendants make here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.665" offset="9150046">In Tcherepnin, the plaintiffs bought shares in a savings or loan association.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.810" offset="9182647">And the defendants there contended that the shares purchased were not stock because looking at the realities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.205" offset="9216188">One, they were not publicly traded as here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.830" offset="9230712">They didn't fluctuate in value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.936" offset="9239071">They redeemed a bullet par only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.723" offset="9250252">That the shares represented memberships rather than investment and I notice to this constant use of the word membership here, that the shares like many customary attributes such as preemptive rights, right to inspect the books, although we have that right in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.303" offset="9316603">And there were restrictions on the signability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.236" offset="9328306">Those all the same issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.491" offset="9337292">And these arguments were held by this unanimous court to be irrelevant to the question whether Federal Security laws were applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.260" offset="9376371">And this Court held that the shares in that case were includable in the statue to stock because there was a stock certificate, and as the Court pointed out there, also the possibility of surplus, which is of course the dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.212" offset="9452231">Even though, mind you, in that case as Your Honors will recall, it was brought in the receivership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.050" offset="9479607">The defendant was neither receiver yet they talked of the potential of surplus, which was sufficient, the very possibility of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.161" offset="9511999">Now clearly in our case these elements exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.397" offset="9524955">Above all, this Court in Tcherepnin pronounced the policy consideration and philosophy of these statutes which provides special insight, we submit, and a large view of the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.452" offset="9593187">There, the Court pointed out that the purpose of the statute was to protect particularly the many small investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.529" offset="9629445">I think there was a quotation that they repeated from Joiner; “Remedial legislation should be construed broadly to effectuate its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.713" offset="9662255">The reach of the Act does not stop with the obvious common place”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.914" offset="9679078">In our case, the plaintiffs were eligible to buy the stock which would give them a four-room apartment with a monthly carrying charge of $23.2 as represented in the prospectus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.979" offset="9735293">If they earned more than $6,600.00, they were ineligible, $6,600.00 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.521" offset="9765491">So that the class that purchased the stock and put up $32.8 million in this case were the same type of small investors as in the Tcherepnin case, indeed much more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.561" offset="9817631">So, obviously, people living on pensions, old people, welfare and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.150" offset="9839992">And yet without these people who collectively put up over $32 million in cash, there could be no Co-op City, because the Mitchell-Lama Act mandated that the venture or risk capital have to come from the public, unlike the other Housing Acts that Section 21, after private housing financed law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.884" offset="9942915">The jurisdictional facts demonstrating that this stock transaction was within the security statutes are spelled out in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.517" offset="9989413">First we have a prospectus called an information bulletin which was widely distributed through the mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.316" offset="10020655">That's paragraph 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.525" offset="10029432">And this bulletin has a heading, appears at 178 A of the record which reads as follows; “Stock and other equity obligations offer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.607" offset="10077811">And there follows, “The housing company” -- that's the River Bay Corporation who's stock we bought -- “invites offers for shares of its capital stock that all in accordance with the terms of the subscription agreement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.160" offset="10151999">And that's at 178 A of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.107" offset="10163806">Now the subscription agreement which was attached to the prospectus and was intended to be torn out and returned with a check for part payment of the stock read, at 104 A “I hereby subscribe to so many shares of class B capital stock” and the par value is $25.00 a share.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.536" offset="10277491">I may say now in answer to a contention made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.929" offset="10307062">All of the money, all of the $432 million instead of $289 million as was represented in the prospectus upon which these poor people put up their savings, all of that money had to be provided by the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.061" offset="10371636">The only thing the state did, this is not like the subsidized housing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.219" offset="10392221">All that the state gave was the advantage of a low interest mortgage valuable indeed, which had to be paid off in full with interest in the 40 years, and all that the state did otherwise was the tax, the city gave, a tax rebate which is done for other housing projects even commercial projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.998" offset="10467349">But the 100% of the money to construct this profit -- this enormous structure for 60,000 people, had to be paid by these 60,000 people and they weren't eligible even to own the stock unless they are into only $6,600.00 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.211" offset="10544253">And the plain practical situation when friend talks of profits and all these general commercial propositions, the plain fact is that through fraudulent representations, which appear in allegations of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.242" offset="10604335">I'm not discussing the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.522" offset="10609455">I'm showing that there is a proper complaint here under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.431" offset="10629099">In their representations they said that the cost above $289 million to construct this would be born by the contractor, which is the CSI.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.031" offset="10683538">And he would take any excess.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.988" offset="10691375">That was the basis on which these people put up their money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.136" offset="10707884">And yet when inflation came, and the cost went up, by fraudulent ignoring of the direct representation that the contractor would bear that cost, if there was an inflation not maintenance increase that we have to pay that kind of inflation or operation, but construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.197" offset="10796178">They increase to $30 million one year, $40 million another year and loaded it on to these people who had taken it on the representation that not one cent of that money would be paid by them but would be paid by the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.267" offset="10848423">And why was this possible?</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.267" offset="10860440">Because the contractor, the CSI and the UHF, this fine organization and incidentally we have not joined these defendants, the heads of these unions and so on, they were tinker heads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.842" offset="10910699">We've sued the operating company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.042" offset="10923551">They had interlocking directors precisely the same directors and officers as the contractor was in the UHF and even our River Bay Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.912" offset="10970990">The company whose stock these people bought had the same directors and officers, so that this was an interlocking situation and which even the Commissioner, the State Commissioner, waived a requirement of bonds for the construction of this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.682" offset="11038072">And he waived the liquidity requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.863" offset="11050820">A liquidity requirement in the contract which said that the contractor must have $13 million liquidity, and he waives that and the contractor has $100,000.00 liquidity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.476" offset="11113305">So that it seems to us that not only have we a clear stock transaction sold in the market to these people but that the -- all the elements of a fraud action exist here under the statutes, and it was intended that the people who built that kind of structure should not be immune anymore than the man who invest for large profits as they call it galactic profits in Wall Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.677" offset="11230124">I don't see why this statute which is remedial should be limited to the large investor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.559" offset="11253635">Legitimate though he be, why should it not apply to these people who put up their life's earnings and probably made the only investment they ever made in stock through their lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.838" offset="11314761">The River Bay Company, our company was, as the complaint says “The captive of the contractor and the sponsor” and $81 million was loaded on to the River Bay stockholders improperly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.017" offset="11375470">And there is a claim since I will not have a chance to rebut again, that there was notice of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.688" offset="11398144">We deny the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.978" offset="11403264">The notice didn't say -- didn't even refer to all these increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.214" offset="11420191">Said there will be an increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.145" offset="11427924">But as Your Honors know, you cannot waive under the Securities Act that provisions and protections of the Act, even if they'd given us notice, it would be ineffectual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.968" offset="11479228">Now it is sufficient for affirmance that in this case we have this widely distributed shares of par value common stock bought for tens of millions of dollars and represented to be stock in a prospectus and the subscription agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.996" offset="11543385">Clearly, this alone warrants application of the of the Federal Securities law and jurisdiction in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.083" offset="11571702">There are two additional grounds for affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.166" offset="11588002">The shares are also an investment contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.145" offset="11599914">They qualify as such clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.684" offset="11610154">And that they are an instrument commonly known as security, another definition of the Securities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.010" offset="11635440">In view of the argument to be made by counsel for the SCC and the time elements, I shall leave these two alternative grounds to our brief at pages 48 to 60.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.802" offset="11682565">And I turn to the Eleventh Amendment question because I think I'd like to deal with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.987" offset="11723316">With respect to the Eleventh Amendment issue, only the State of New York is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.659" offset="11745991">The agency is not involved and clearly may be sued into federal court for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.923" offset="11775039">It is a separate legal entity and it is not a division or department of the State of New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="2938.608" offset="11857795">An agency is a person and under the interpretation that the -- this Court has given to the Securities Act, a definition of person includes state, governmental agency of any kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="2962.799" offset="11954552">Well I would've thought that 1983 cost of action would've turned on the definition of person in 1983 rather than in the Securities Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2973.533" offset="11997497">Well, it's a person under a Civil Rights Act as a I suppose the other aspect of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.654" offset="12021948">But under the Securities Act we also have a definition which defines person as any state which is to me one of the reasons why there is an authority to sue here, and the waiver does take effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.763" offset="12094464">The fact that the -- there is a separate legal entity in the agency is not -- is conceded by the Attorney General of the State of New York in his opinion Number 56, which we've cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.281" offset="12152456">But second and determinative is the fact that any judgment against the agency is not enforceable against the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.775" offset="12190490">They are two separate entities and there is no link of liability by statutes or otherwise for each others obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.950" offset="12215150">Indeed, Your Honors, there's a specific disclaimer of liability in Section 46, subdivision 8 of the Private Housing Finance Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.453" offset="12253184">And the bonds of the agency are not the debt of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.599" offset="12269798">Therefore, like any other corporation, the agency is subject to federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.711" offset="12290173">Now with respect to the state, it has waived its immunity in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.689" offset="12314102">First, by special statute quoted at page 67 of our brief, the white document.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.448" offset="12345135">It's Section 325 of the Private Housing Finance Law, and by its -- secondly and by its conduct in this very case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.180" offset="12384110">Now first as to the statute, you've been told that the statute waives immunity only in the suit in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.388" offset="12428936">There's nothing in the language of the statute which would justify any such limitation however strict the construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.958" offset="12467179">On the contrary, the statute reads that the state “may be sued in the same manner as a private person.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.201" offset="12508139">Surely a private person can be sued in a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.109" offset="12523813">Indeed, a private person cannot be sued in the state court of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.604" offset="12549831">Furthermore, there is a conclusive indicator in the language of the waiver that it was not intended to limit jurisdiction in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.420" offset="12597060">That language refers to the scope of the waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.406" offset="12613047">It reads “With regard to liabilities arising out of the Mitchell-Lama Act, the state may be sued in the same manner as a private person.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.835" offset="12674696">Now what term could be more generic and all inclusive than the word liabilities?</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.803" offset="12698624">Case law set which we set forth in page 68 of our brief, demonstrates that the unqualified use of the word liabilities encompasses federal as well as state claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.944" offset="12763199">And the supervisory duties of the state through the Commissioner with respect to cooperative housing are all pervasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.228" offset="12796322">The Commissioner's charged with responsibility to see that River Bay complies with “the law”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.999" offset="12823385">That's Section 321.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.924" offset="12831117">So River Bay stocks sold in violation of the anti-fraud provisions of the security law certainly brings into definition what do we mean by compliance with law, and that has been interpreted even by the New York courts, the laws of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.380" offset="12904887">The second sentence of the waiver which prohibits the recovery of costs has been raised in the brief, though not argued orally, prohibits recovery of costs against the state does not alter the right to sue in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.480" offset="12973328">It merely means that the plaintiff can not recover cost because he has accepted the condition of the waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.565" offset="13001644">Now in its reply brief, the state cites five cases all dealing with refunds of state taxes and these cases are not applicable to our case, because there the statute set forth are comprehensive scheme involving procedures before state administrative agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.808" offset="13086595">The final step of which was judicial review of the state agencies determination in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.419" offset="13117001">Furthermore, all that was involved there in these five cases were state tax law, not as here federally created right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.501" offset="13145422">I stress the fact that this is not a case of diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.496" offset="13161305">We belong here under the right of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.326" offset="13180635">In addition to statutory waiver, there is the state's conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.408" offset="13204982">This Court set forth a test composed of two elements to determine when the state's conduct constitutes a waiver, the Edelman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.852" offset="13242807">And incidentally that was argued in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.475" offset="13253256">It came down late but was argued there and the court rejected it as I think this Court should.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.425" offset="13281050">Did Congress intend the federal statute to apply to the states?</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.946" offset="13303202">Test one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.397" offset="13308949">Did the state by its conduct, voluntarily enter into a federally regulated area?</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.451" offset="13333191">Test two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.430" offset="13341132">Now as to Congress' intention to include states, the evidence is undeniable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.682" offset="13366105">The Securities Act of 1933, Section 2 (1) says it includes “Governments and their subdivisions, and the house and Senate reports” which we cite voluminously at pages 71 to 73 of our brief, state emphatically and repeatedly that “Person includes states”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.594" offset="13469759">And incidentally, the 1933 and 1934 Acts has been held in Tcherepnin not to be read in pari materia and therefore wouldn't matter which that statute we took which year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.212" offset="13520227">And at the same time that the statute included states, it provided in Section 27 of the 1934 Act for exclusive, exclusive jurisdiction in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.188" offset="13576129">Now how significant that combination of provision is to reject any argument by the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.514" offset="13601416">Thus Congress notified the states that if the states chose to engage in the interstate sale of securities, the price for it was waiver of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.247" offset="13648332">Having shown that Congress has intention to include states, I now turn to whether the State of New York chose to engage in the sale of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.732" offset="13682291">This is not, as has been stated in the brief and orally, a matter of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.115" offset="13707786">We admit that's a straw man in these briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.609" offset="13721788">We admit that states regulation is not -- doesn't subject it to the federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.551" offset="13745612">Here we have the state participating pervasively in every fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.407" offset="13760972">Indeed, under the Mitchell-Lama Act, not a shovel of earth could have been turned until public put up this $32 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.564" offset="13817605">In other words, the state from the beginning to the end not only supervisors, no regulation merely, it organized the entire construction in every way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.945" offset="13867133">Also, the State of New York in 1955 passed the Mitchell-Lama Act, and this was 20 years after the Security Act, so that the state with full knowledge that it was in the realm of federal regulation went ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.994" offset="13927320">And the Mitchell-Lama Act itself represents the decision by the state to furnish housing by obtaining venture or risk capital from the public through sale of Co-op stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.735" offset="13982281">To be brief, and in conclusion since my time is running out, the state under the statute is the major participant in planning the project, raising the venture capital from the public, construction and operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.881" offset="14058872">The project for which it received the fee from the plaintiffs of $3,510,000.00 obviously no mere filing fee under the blue sky laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.071" offset="14099623">And no other state has a statute of waiver of immunity similar to Section 325.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.613" offset="14137866">I say this because I don't think we're enlarging, there have been alarms caused in this brief that this will cause interference with state issue, and so financing nothing of the kind, neither -- on neither side of the issue is there an extension here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.489" offset="14201292">We are asking that the Court not delimit the rights that have always existed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.851" offset="14226787">Even as to New York, this would be extremely limited, because this waiver only applies in the Mitchell-Lama Law, not many other provisions of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.414" offset="14265031">So we're dealing here with an exceedingly restricted area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.513" offset="14281435">But the rights of these plaintiffs ought to be tested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.838" offset="14294706">We have waited three years, Your Honors, to get a trial in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.212" offset="14308185">Why we have been banded around through the courts on this alleged jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.867" offset="14326888">I think it's time that these people had a day in court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3577.236" offset="14412361">In this case we have, as has been noted, 15,000 persons who have paid over $32 million to purchase over $1 million shares of stock in a cooperative housing corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.853" offset="14470771">And the funds, those $32 million were utilized by that corporation in the construction of that apartment project.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.227" offset="14508283">The Securities and Exchange Commission submits that their allegations are fraud, which are based upon documents that were given to them in connection with that project, should be heard under the Federal Securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.317" offset="14568678">Now these persons executed essentially two documents as I understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.083" offset="14591666">One was a subscription agreement to buy stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.309" offset="14612564">The other was an occupancy agreement which was in effect a lease.</text>

            <text syncTime="3633.582" offset="14637746">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.644" offset="14641925">But it's important that there were two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.004" offset="14651434">And in this case, we wish to emphasize that one of them talks about stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.063" offset="14675675">And that is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.231" offset="14684348">And while it has been noted that of course substance should prevail over form, the fact that stock is involved here is not merely a question of form as perhaps was implicit in that suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.550" offset="14745579">On the other hand, I think that it is fair to say that the fact that there is stock, itself connotes substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.988" offset="14775359">Stock has certain attributes, and these are the attributes of a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.469" offset="14797197">And that is what is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.954" offset="14811199">Persons who are asked to buy stock may reasonably expect that they're going to be protected by the laws which apply to stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.137" offset="14843904">And why shouldn't they be?</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.652" offset="14849964">It was sold to them as stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.063" offset="14859577">It wasn't sold to them as anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.008" offset="14871385">This Court has said on several occasions that it is not unreasonable that a promoters offering be judged on what he represents it to be.</text>

            <text syncTime="4454.952" offset="17923218">And so, when we offer the possibility in our brief that the registration requirements of the Securities Act might not be applicable, I think that it is a reasonable suggestion to make.</text>

            <text syncTime="4611.223" offset="18548276">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="4612.449" offset="18553187">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4614.790" offset="18562487">My learned friend, Mr. Nizer, opened by an impressive set of figures which were designed I think to impress with their size.</text>
            <text syncTime="4625.161" offset="18603969">He spoke of the large number of shares, the large number of residents and the large amount of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="4632.195" offset="18632182">But I take it that questions of jurisdiction are not measured by that kind of a yardstick and the same principles would be applied if this was a two 20-room house only in New York and was financed by a very much smaller transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4649.025" offset="18699473">So I think we can disregard this jury appeal and address ourselves to the question as to whether we're talking about a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="4657.899" offset="18735000">Of course my learned friend keeps on saying that they bought stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="4661.164" offset="18748061">And I kept on saying that they bought homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4663.932" offset="18759137">And the economic reality which the case which Mr. Justice Rehnquist referred to, compels us to listen to is what was the business transaction that this homeowner -- home buyer was interested in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4680.594" offset="18825697">Say because it's called a share of stock?</text>
            <text syncTime="4684.303" offset="18840534">Well, Mr. Justice Stewart referred to livestock, it's also stock, and not all trees are trees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4691.838" offset="18870732">If some are whiffletrees and some are hat trees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4695.374" offset="18884838">The mere fact that you hang a label on it of stock because this is the conventional mechanism by which the general public has approached this way, doesn't necessarily lead to the conclusion that it's stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="4709.003" offset="18939382">I'm not suggesting for a minute that when you call something stock, you shouldn't examine whether it isn't stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.181" offset="18964146">And of course you start out by saying “He called it stock, maybe it is.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4720.113" offset="18983790">But the statute doesn't say every security -- every stock is a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="4726.648" offset="19009912">The statute says every stock is a security unless the context otherwise directs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.153" offset="19040005">And the context takes us back to the purposes of the statute, to the legislative object.</text>
            <text syncTime="4740.896" offset="19066964">And the legislative object under the securities laws was to control the marketplace's securities, the marketplace and investments, the marketplace in speculations in that kind of money making enterprises, and not in a social welfare scheme of the kind we are talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4760.830" offset="19146689">Mr. Nizer referred to the cash contribution of 7% which the subscribers here furnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.718" offset="19178245">Well, it is in the aggregate a very large amount of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="4773.236" offset="19196322">But the comparison that I would make would be more to the fact that a Medicare participant, an age group to which I now belong, pays a small percentage of his medical bill when he goes to the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="4788.127" offset="19255881">That doesn't mean that it is not a social welfare program that we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4795.407" offset="19285034">On the question of rescindability which was mentioned, I should say that every contract here was rescindable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4802.457" offset="19313246">Thousands of them were rescinded and even the plaintiff below, Mr. Milton Forman rescinded their contracts recently when they moved out of the apartment and got their money back.</text>
            <text syncTime="4816.220" offset="19368208">On one question I must take issue with my learned friend and that is on the definition of person as given in the Securities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.987" offset="19411362">The 1934 Act does not define the state as a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="4832.358" offset="19432782">The 1934 Act as I read it says the term person means an individual, a corporation, a partnership and association, a joint stock company, a business dress or an incorporated organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4846.793" offset="19490565">So it can't be the 1934 Act in which the fraud statute appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="4851.158" offset="19508015">It's the 1933 Act which deals with registration which includes a Government or political subdivision thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="4858.464" offset="19537272">But nobody claims that we should have registered at this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4861.358" offset="19548766">We didn't of course and nobody claims we should have.</text>

            <text syncTime="4876.233" offset="19608325">Now, on the question of dividends, no cooperative pays dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="4885.888" offset="19646882">Essentially, a cooperative is ten couples going to the theatre together and contributing $25.00 a piece.</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.874" offset="19670915">If when they return from the theatre, there's $10.00 left in the kitty, they pay it back to the subscribers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.287" offset="19692544">That doesn't mean that that theatre party declared a dividend in a business venture for which the people invested their $25.00.</text>

            <text syncTime="4924.618" offset="19801840">Now, this Court of Appeals must've been troubled by this very question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4934.804" offset="19842591">If it weren't troubled by the question as to whether this was really security, they wouldn't have reached out, for what I must most respectfully say the trivia which they identified as the profit features of this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4950.531" offset="19905494">Just look at them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4952.170" offset="19912077">They said that there was a reduced carrying charges resulting from the rentals received out of commercial spaces.</text>
            <text syncTime="4973.392" offset="19996923">Now I think this Court ought to know what we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4976.726" offset="20010297">In this community of 15,000 home and 15,000 people, there had to some grocers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4982.667" offset="20034017">Incidentally, this is quite remote from the center of town.</text>
            <text syncTime="4987.047" offset="20051571">There had to be some butchers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4988.314" offset="20056586">There had to be some barbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4989.661" offset="20062020">There had to be some people who are rendering that kind of normal neighborhood service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4995.816" offset="20086680">And naturally, you have to make space available for them and some income was generated that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5004.244" offset="20120325">Does that make this a shopping center investment?</text>
            <text syncTime="5008.567" offset="20137671">It's to me comparable if the management of this cooperative had said “We're going to charge every householder for his bathwater.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5016.410" offset="20169017">That would generate some money.</text>
            <text syncTime="5018.376" offset="20176854">But that then would make the housing cooperative a business venture in the sense of earning dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="5025.893" offset="20206947">The second thing they said was that these securities were tax -- that these homeowners enjoy tax deductibility for their share of the interest and the mortgage and their share of the taxes that they paid to the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="5043.411" offset="20277060">And of course that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="5045.283" offset="20284479">As this Court well knows, every homeowner is entitled to that deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5050.316" offset="20304645">Every owner of a cooperative apartment is entitled of that deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5054.233" offset="20320319">Every owner of a condominium apartment is entitled to that deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5057.968" offset="20335261">Has nothing to do with the securities business at all, has nothing to do with the investment aspects of this thing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5065.620" offset="20365876">It is an aspect of homeownership, not of security ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="5069.614" offset="20381863">And moreover, it doesn't depend upon the efforts of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="5073.684" offset="20398059">It depends upon the taxpayer's personal status.</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.524" offset="20409448">If he has no reportable income, this tax deduction doesn't do him any good.</text>
            <text syncTime="5081.386" offset="20428884">It's only if he has some income against which he can take this deduction that he confers any benefit upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5087.837" offset="20454693">And the third item that really was reaching, they said “Well, this is a bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.563" offset="20485622">It's going to cost them less to live.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5099.095" offset="20499728">That's the benefit that the state conferred upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.335" offset="20512684">That's like saying the Medicare is a profitable enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="5107.490" offset="20533373">This just doesn't add up to my -- in my way of thinking of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.588" offset="20549674">Of course there were cooperative ownership means that the people run the property don't make a profit so you don't have to pay that profit to the man who runs it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5120.800" offset="20586559">It also imposes some obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5122.772" offset="20594500">It means you got to see that the snow is shoveled, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5126.665" offset="20610069">But to call this bargain an aspect of a profit aspect of this enterprise goes beyond what I think is rational elucidation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5139.114" offset="20659806">Now as far as the FCC is concerned, I can say very little.</text>
            <text syncTime="5142.937" offset="20675166">Their brief was only delivered to me, all within -- the final brief I didn't get till yesterday I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="5149.547" offset="20701602">And we've put in a typewritten answer which we will furnish -- printed brief on.</text>
