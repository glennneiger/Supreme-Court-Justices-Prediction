            <label>Mr. Harry A. Dower</label>
            <text syncTime="36.146" offset="247933">Please Your Honors, this matter appeared before the Court having granted a petition for writ of certiorari on the petition of David Serfass to review the record of the Third Circuit which had reversed a decision of the United States District Court for the middle district of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.908" offset="322957">Chief Judge Michael Sheridan had granted and ordered dismissing the indictment on motion having been filed on behalf of Mr. Serfass.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.293" offset="356498">He had been indicted for refusing to submit to induction under the Selective Service Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.465" offset="389204">David Serfass was in the Peace Corp in Pohnpei, a remote island in the pacific and he had completed his two years of duty there and was requested by the Panape Transportation Authority to serve several months longer to complete the training of a native as a maintenance superintendent.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.486" offset="461302">There was some mix up in his notifying his draft board that his term in the Peace Corps had been concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.415" offset="488991">He did receive a notice to report for induction -- there was again another mix-up but he did make it to Allentown his residence, 2 a.m on the day that he was to report for transportation at 5 a. m.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.379" offset="548864">He went to the induction center in Wilks-Barre and was found to be suffering from amoebic dysentery and was returned to report at a later date.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.305" offset="592541">It was at that interval for the first time that he spoke to the pastor of this church and learned and in his discussions with his pastor, he began to have very serious reservations about serving in a military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.054" offset="651577">He then upon advice applied for form 150 from the Selective Service Administration which is the form to be used for an application for classification of the conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.091" offset="707688">The draft board perfunctorily denied his application and just stated to him that there was no change in classification over which he had no control and again ordered him to report for induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.352" offset="764740">This time, he again went to the induction center and the usual procedure in case of this kind at the last minute, refused to take oath and to submit to induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.110" offset="803819">About 20 months later, he was indicted and arrested and a trial date was set for speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.316" offset="832658">At that time, we filed two motions, one, a motion to dismiss the indictment and also a concurrent or simultaneous motion to postpone the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.247" offset="868394">Judge Sheridan did grant -- ordered the postponement of the trial, set a date for oral argument of the motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.779" offset="898487">And at that argument, the United States attorney did stipulate that the application for conscientious objector classification, which David Serfass had made did meet the prima facie requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.303" offset="952613">Following this and with a short time after the oral argument, Judge Sheridan requested and this was agreed by both parties by David Serfass and by the United States that his entire Selective Service file be submitted to Judge Sheridan and this was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.559" offset="1013635">Some months later, Judge Sheridan pursuant to a line of cases in the Third Circuit did grant the motion, did order that dismissal of indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.622" offset="1057834">The Government appealed and we moved to dismiss in the Third Circuit on the ground of lack of jurisdiction and that matter as well as the argument on the merits were briefed simultaneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.860" offset="1110810">The Third Circuit at that time had adopted a procedure whereby on its own order would dispense with oral argument and that was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.409" offset="1144978">It of course has oral arguments within this case, there was an oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.740" offset="1162324">Now, the time interval here was interesting, this Court in its decision in Elhert had indicated that there is a no mans land between the draft board having considered a request on the merits for conscientious objector classification after notice of induction had been received, and the same kind of rather and a consideration of this issue within the military service, that the Court may very well consider that to be as a situation different from Elhert.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.593" offset="1293772">The Musser case which was decided last summer in a per curiam opinion, I think only one dissent, Justice Douglas dissented, in a sense clarified at least for the Third Circuit, the holding in Elhert and under Musser, it was held that the draft boards had no power to consider a request for conscientious objector classification after a notice of induction had been sent.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.808" offset="1390634">As a consequence, the Third Circuit reversed on the merits and also denied the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</text>

          <turn speaker="harry_a_dower" startTime="361.444" stopTime="631.843">
            <label>Mr. Harry A. Dower</label>
            <text syncTime="361.444" offset="1549145">No sir, he could not have made a finding of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.372" offset="1560848">The motion to dismiss and it was accompanied by an affidavit relating to several pages from the Selective Service file, but no jury trial has ever been waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.435" offset="1601076">There was no formal motion for acquittal, it's quite correct sir that we do not argue for a moment, that he could’ve been found guilty on the motion to dismiss the indictment, not having been tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.277" offset="1680488">After the denial -- after the reversal of the District Court order by the Third Circuit, we then petition for a writ of certiorari and I'm quite aware that there are several other cases that we argued this morning all of which have come up at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.503" offset="1737435">And generally deal with the 1971 Criminal Appeals Act which was an Amendment to the Act following this Court’s decision in Sisson.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.806" offset="1778604">I think perhaps for me at least the only thing it's clear about the 1971 Amendment is that it was a response for this Court's decision in Sisson.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.118" offset="1819878">Now, this Act is different, and so far as I know, these are the first cases to come up under this Act, now raising that question as to what the Act means at least in particularly in reference to the Double Jeopardy provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.082" offset="1879751">Now, the Act I would note and I think this is quite important.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.734" offset="1894275">Is not the bill that was introduced into the senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.048" offset="1915591">The Act now provides that in a criminal case and appeal by the United States shall lie to a Court of Appeals from an order dismissing an indictment and the important words at least as far as were concerned is except that no appeal should rely with the Double Jeopardy Clause if the constitution prohibits it.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.960" offset="1991241">Now, there were back at the point where perhaps we were in 1907 when the Senate considering the original Criminal Appeals Act had decided or had rather debated, that they're going to depend upon this Court to tell the Senate and tell us what Double Jeopardy meant, because of all the cases that have been decided particularly in the recent years and many of them under the Selective Service Act, there really is no firm guide for anyone so far as I can see to know just what Double Jeopardy means in terms of pre-trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.043" offset="2147558">In some cases post-trial dismissals of an indictment or of a charge whatever it maybe called.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.855" offset="2174830">Sisson of course was a post-trial dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.840" offset="2190712">Serfass is a pre-trial dismissal, the second case you have today, the Jenkins case is one of which is again a post-trial dismissal -- oh, I'm sorry, it was an acquittal in the trial by a judge and the third case that you have this morning, the Wilson case, is one in which there was a dismissal of a charge after a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.759" offset="2286425">Now, in Serfass, we argue that this Act, the 1971 Criminal Appeals Act must have some meaning in order not to be a truism.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.469" offset="2337207">I would dispose off the latter part first by saying that I cannot conceive how Congress could enact the Criminal Appeals Act which would authorize the United States to appeal in violation of the Double Jeopardy provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.792" offset="2390497">Congress does have the power to regulate the jurisdiction of the courts but I cannot understand and I'm very happy that we don't have to argue or don’t have that case that an appeal would lie, which is contrary to the Double Jeopardy provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.641" offset="2441906">So, if this exception is to have any meaning, then this is what I assume what these cases are about, just what is Double Jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.756" offset="2486418">Now, I would also point out that as I understand the real burden, the real thrust of the Government's brief in the Serfass case and to some extent in the others too.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.446" offset="2541171">What the government is attempting to do is to have decisions of this Court which in effect would reinstate the bill as introduced into the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.279" offset="2576488">Under which an appeal would have been possible from any pre-trial disposition of a case, short of an acquittal or a conviction of course, everyone would be appealing a conviction.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="631.843" offset="2630719">Well, is there difference in the language in the bills make much difference Mr. Dower, isn't it clear from the bill that was enacted that Congress meant to authorize appeals in all cases unless appeal would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_dower" startTime="648.085" stopTime="774.337">
            <label>Mr. Harry A. Dower</label>
            <text syncTime="648.085" offset="2695711">I don't think so Sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.527" offset="2709504">When Congress said that an appeal in the criminal case lies from an order dismissing an indictment, surely it must contemplate that there are situations in which a dismissal would have a reason or would have brought about -- I'm sorry, that prior to dismissal, jeopardy would have attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.806" offset="2794559">Now, I think except for the Jenkins case, which is to be argued next, everybody has always talked that an acquittal was an end to a proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.257" offset="2840430">This was far back in 1896 in the Ball case and 1904 in the Kepner case, acquittals ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.512" offset="2877419">So, that what we are really talking about is at least in Serfass is a pre-trial disposition of the case in some fashion other than an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.336" offset="2916707">Now, what is the -- what does this Act mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="711.335" offset="2948681">If it's not a truism, does it not address itself to a situation where an indictment has been dismissed short of a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.150" offset="2987969">And if jeopardy has attached in that proceeding, then Double Jeopardy Clause of the constitution would prohibit this.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.073" offset="3027675">I am quite aware sir, Mr. Justice White that your distinction in your dissent in the Sisson case of the distinction made between technical and constitutional jeopardy and I'm quite willing to admit that the manner and which we used the word technical jeopardy in our brief is different from the way you used it and I -- further reflection I think that perhaps your distinction if I understand that would be more appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.779" offset="3134464">But when does jeopardy attach is to a large extent the question that is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.578" offset="3157661">And in fact, what is jeopardy?</text>
            <text syncTime="765.735" offset="3166333">The Government argues that there is no jeopardy until there has been a trial, either by a jury or trial by a judge alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="894.712" offset="3682200">All the cases sir reached so hard as did the majority in this Court to find that the determination made by court was an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.130" offset="3727862">And I suggest Sir that you don't need to constrict yourselves by the label of an acquittal that once fact-finding has commenced in reference to an issue that would dispose off the case that this is when jeopardy attaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.144" offset="3799960">Now, the reason I say this and argue in this fashion is that, all of the old cases which talked in terms of jeopardy arising upon a trial or an impaneling of the jury, are cases when our pleading and practice procedure was such this was nearly the only way to dispose off an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.878" offset="3874879">We did not have Rule of Criminal Procedure 12 (b) (1) or really Rule 12 and all its parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.415" offset="3921063">The Common Law aside from the motion on arrest of judgment which gave everybody so much trouble in the Sisson case, the motion in bar -- aside from that, nearly the only way that I know of to dispose off a case was by a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.733" offset="3990340">Now, in the last 70 years, we have developed new and modern methods of pleading and practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.165" offset="4023986">Now that started with the court pleading as adopted in the states in the late 1930's where there are rules of Civil Procedure, Federal rules and in 1946, I think it's the date the adoption of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.877" offset="4078843">And we have done away with the old common law terms of demurrer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.571" offset="4105697">Speaking demurrers yet when I am speaking demur, common law was prohibited, yet this is precisely -- I'm sorry, this is what it's not really precisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.961" offset="4143208">This is what Rule 12 (b) (1) provides for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.079" offset="4163688">Some method of disposing of issues prior to a full trial where if you like the Court must go outside of the indictment, the bare-bones indictment in order to make the determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.136" offset="4219904">Rule 12 (b) (4) provides for the holding of a hearing to make these determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.269" offset="4244459">Another rule 47 I believe it is which permits the filing of an affidavit in connection with these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.791" offset="4266506">Now, this is different from the 1907 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.986" offset="4291271">The way these issues can be brought before our court today are entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.229" offset="4316244">We now -- and this is what was done in the Serfass case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.482" offset="4341321">Now, there was no dispute as to any of the facts in the motion to dismiss the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.157" offset="4376012">All of the Government's evidence incidentally was in, was before the judge, although I quite agree there was no possibility finding him guilty at that time, but the court did consider the entire bit of evidence that the government had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.333" offset="4444662">Excuse me, this is also noted not in precisely to those terms in the Government's brief in the letter in the last several pages of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.799" offset="4474546">They also acknowledged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.239" offset="4480293">Now, what happens in the prosecution of a Selective Service case is that the Government gets the entire Selective Service file and evidence as a business record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.860" offset="4518849">Occasionally, there will be an officer from the induction center to testify but whatever evidence the Government has is in the Selective Service file.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.742" offset="4554376">Now, that was a situation in the Serfass case, unlike Brewster for example, where this Court held that an appeal would lie from an order dismissing the indictment where one did not have to go outside the indictment for the disposition of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.469" offset="4629295">But here, this was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.280" offset="4640475">Now, I propose or submit to Your Honors that in this part of the 20th century, what Double Jeopardy means or should mean is that jeopardy attaches when the fact-finding process begins, as to an issue which would dispose off the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.384" offset="4712887">Now, no case that I ever heard have read speaks in those terms precisely in those terms, but there are a number of cases in Circuit Courts, they have held to this effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1644.026" offset="6679489">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.594" offset="6689729">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit to review a judgment of that Court which sustained it’s jurisdiction to hear an appeal by the United States from a pre-trial order of the District Court dismissing an indictment on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.807" offset="6754617">The Court of Appeals also reversed the order of the District Court and remanded the case for a new trial or other proceedings not inconsistent with its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.398" offset="6792965">The petition for certiorari which was filed here did not in anyway challenge the determination of the Court of Appeals on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.055" offset="6827551">It challenged only the determination of the Court of Appeals that it could consistent with the Double Jeopardy Clause entertain the appeal by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.148" offset="6863914">Before getting into the merits, I would like to address myself to one question that occurred to us and which we have looked into and that is the availability of the President’s pardon and Clemency Program that these defendants -- should the Court delay its decision beyond the 31st of January of 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.109" offset="6935803">And we have been told and counsel for both Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Serfass have been advised that if they wrote to the respective Untied States Attorney’s Offices and indicated their intention to unveil themselves or their desire to avail themselves of the alternative service program, should there be a judgment in this Court adverse to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.217" offset="7016260">They could preserve their rights to participate in the alternative service program even if they ultimately applied for it after January 31st because of the delayed decision of this Court which might be adverse to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.861" offset="7070804">To turn to the merits of the appeal in this case, there are really two issues presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.521" offset="7097448">First, the issue whether the Congress intended to authorize the appeal from this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.438" offset="7121168">The Criminal Appeals Act provides that the United States can appeal to the Court of Appeals from a decision order or judgment dismissing an indictment in a criminal case, unless the Double Jeopardy Clause would bar further prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.159" offset="7172054">Moreover, in order to overcome the restrictive interpretation that had been placed on similarly worded earlier Criminal Appeals Act which had limited the Government’s right to appeal from dismissals only where the dismissals were permitted appeals rather only where the dismissals were based on the four corners of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.921" offset="7247078">Congress deliberately wrote in to section 3731, a rule of a liberal construction and mandated that the statute be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.579" offset="7293680">Not only from this language but from the legislative history of the Criminal Appeals Act that it’s plain beyond any doubt that Congress intended to authorize the appeal in question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.249" offset="7336417">Indeed, at the Senate Judiciary Committee in an excerpt quoted at page 16 of our brief observed that the problems of appealability have become especially serious in Selective Service cases where judges have reviewed defendant’s Selective Service files before trial and dismissed the indictments after finding that there have been errors by the draft boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.063" offset="7419591">These are issues to be determined by a judge, not a jury and there is no reason why they should not be subject to appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.596" offset="7457729">Congress not only was concerned about all pre-trial dismissals but particularly those in Selective Service cases and it’s quite plain and indeed from reading petitioner's brief, we had assumed that he had conceded the issue that the statute quite plainly intended to authorize the appeal from the pre- trial order dismissing the indictment in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.355" offset="7540799">This brings us then to the second question that’s presented and that is whether an appeal from this order is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.147" offset="7576012">And in this connection it's worth again recalling the words of the constitutional provision that nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.113" offset="7623868">Now, while that term has a certain degree of vagueness and it's never been given a completely clear and fixed definition, one thing is certain from every case that is ever construed the Double Jeopardy Clause of the constitution and that is a person is not placed in jeopardy until a trial has begun at which he is in danger of having a judgment of conviction entered against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.737" offset="7718327">And until that time has come, he has not been placed in jeopardy and that the Double Jeopardy Clause protects a defendant against being tried that is being placed in jeopardy of conviction for a second time and at that is case is such as Illinois v. Somerville made clear, the guarantee is not even absolute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2256.154" offset="9127999">Well, I would think that if the event happened that is the second indictment were brought the defense would be to dismiss that indictment on the grounds of Double Jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.832" offset="9162689">Now, whether you say that it's how -- I think it becomes after a point that material was to how you characterize or whether you say the indictment should be dismissed because it can’t be retried and it's pointless to have that indictment or to say that after the acquittal even the indictment itself has barred us, is I think it just turns on a language he used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.126" offset="9239907">I don't think it's significant, the significant part is and as this Court has repeatedly said that it's the Double Jeopardy Clause which protects against a second trial for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.578" offset="9285674">Now, my adversary is suggested that there are no firm guides in which to instruct the Court and how to proceed in this case which involved a pre-trial dismissal and we would suggest that there are at least a hundred years of precedent to this Court to guide it in designing this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.338" offset="9364773">The most extinct summary of the law in this area was stated by Mr. Justice Brandeis in his opinion in Collins versus Loisel where he said, the constitutional provision against Double Jeopardy can have no application unless a prisoner has there to for been placed on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.458" offset="9433213">The preliminary examination of one arrested on suspension of crime is not a trial and his discharge by the magistrate upon an examination is not an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.367" offset="9472815">Even the finding of an indictment followed by arraignment pleading there to repeated continuances and eventually dismissal at the instance of the prosecuting officer on the ground that there was not sufficient evidence to hold the accused, was held not to constitute jeopardy and this principle has been illustrated in numerous cases decided by this Court under the old Criminal Appeals Act which permitted the United States to appeal to this Court directly from a order of a District Court characterized as a motion in bar entered before jeopardy has attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.078" offset="9607711">And this Court consistently held in construing that statute that where the defendant has not been put to trial, he has not been put in jeopardy and I think that a particular significance to the issue here are the cases which involved appeals to this Court for motions in bar which sustained the defense of the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.977" offset="9691303">That defense goes to the general issue in the case and as a matter of fact in two opinions of this Court, a pre-trial ordered dismissing an indictment on statute of limitations grounds was characterized as an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.645" offset="9741981">Nevertheless, this Court has repeatedly entertained appeals from such orders because the defendant had not been placed in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.307" offset="9772596">The most recent of that was in United States v. Goldman in which the issue -- the same arguments that were made here were made there, that was an appeal from the dismissal on statute of limitations grounds which goes to the general issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.067" offset="9823692">There was a pre-trial dismissal and this Court rejecting a challenge to its jurisdiction stated that since the District Court had not commenced it sitting for trial, the defendants in error had not been in placed in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.045" offset="9879594">Now, the defendant of course concedes that in fact the jeopardy had not attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.928" offset="9911045">Instead, he argues that because of the fact that the dismissal of the indictment was the functional equivalent of an acquittal on the merits that constructively jeopardy has attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.032" offset="9959528">And this argument which really takes us to the first of the Court of Appeals’ decisions which have denied the Government the right to appeal from pre-trial orders is based on what we believe to be a serious misconception of the meaning and purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.233" offset="10020342">We don’t have to equival all the terms, we can concede that if an acquittal is a termination or a ruling in favor of the defendant after the trial on the issue of guilt or innocence that maybe characterized as an acquittal and that a pre-trial dismissal on the merits maybe viewed as an analog of an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.547" offset="10093589">But the reason that a defendant cannot be tried again after he has been tried once and acquitted, is not necessarily because he has been acquitted but because he has been placed on trial and been put in jeopardy of conviction once and so the Double Jeopardy Clause of force and protection not only from an acquittal but a conviction and even protection against a second trial where the jury did not reach a verdict, if the case was terminated improperly prior to verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.264" offset="10212394">And so that it makes little sense to say that the argument that this is somehow an acquittal doesn’t really answer any question at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.025" offset="10251473">The question is whether he has been placed once in jeopardy and whether if the Government is successful on its appeal, he would be placed in jeopardy the second time and it was this critical distinction which we believe was overlooked for example by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in United States against Ponto which has become the leading Court of Appeals decision on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.856" offset="10338826">There in excerpt quoted at page 34 of our brief, the Court of Appeals in a case not different from the instant case said that, “Since the dismissal order was based on the determination on the merits, it was an acquittal to which jeopardy had attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.844" offset="10406745">Now, it's interesting to note in the Green case which is one of the cases that's cited by the Court, Mr. Justice Black wrote for this Court that it is the acquittal which ends the jeopardy that has attached at the commencement of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.299" offset="10456586">It's not an acquittal, it's not jeopardy which attaches to an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.436" offset="10473096">Moreover, the Courts of Appeals continued thus Government appeal from this ruling would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment since a re-trial on the charge would be prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.088" offset="10515728">But when was he tried initially on the charge?</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.080" offset="10527744">The Court of Appeals never address itself to that issue, and it's not surprising that of the five judges of the Seventh Circuit who composed in majority, two of the five did not even join in this reasoning and they adopted yet another analysis which the Ninth Circuit has also subscribed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.541" offset="10597543">And they said that since this was a dismissal with prejudice, and since therefore the Government could not bring a second prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.175" offset="10628054">Therefore, it was barred from appealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.657" offset="10637981">And in making this argument, the Court relied on the opinion of this Court “United States against Oppenheimer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.193" offset="10664103">That case was a case in which the Government had indicted someone for violating the Bankruptcy Act conspiracy that committed fraud under the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.856" offset="10702764">The defendant made a motion to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds, the motion was granted, the United States never appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.297" offset="10736515">Subsequently, this Court in a decision had redefined and clarified the law in the area and it was plain that the initial determination of the District Court dismissing the indictment was an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.592" offset="10785729">The United States then brought a second indictment against the defendant and he then alleged that that second indictment was barred either under the doctrine of res judicata or the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.694" offset="10834108">And this Court held that the second indictment was barred because the failure of the Government to appeal from the first indictment left standing on the record a final order on the merits, and that the civil law of doctrine of res judicata applied to a criminal case even to a pre-trial dismissal, on the merits where the Government had not appealed but sought to bring a new indictment the defendant could in effect invoke the doctrine of res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.086" offset="10951764">But of course that does not follow from that that the Government could not appeal from the initial dismissal of the order and of course in United States versus Goldman to which I referred to afterwards which was decided after United States against Oppenheimer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.307" offset="11012577">This Court entertained an appeal, a direct appeal from the dismissal of and indictment on statute of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2859.871" offset="11542862">So, that the second and what we think to be misguided ground upon which the Court of Appeals of (Inaudible) is this misunderstanding of the doctrine of res judicata that is because the doctrine would bar a second indictment where the first indictment was dismissed and not appealed from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.217" offset="11604198">Therefore for some reason the Government could not appeal from the initial pre-trial dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.736" offset="11626350">Yet a third ground which was suggested by the Courts of Appeals is one similar to that suggested by Mr. Justice Marshall that is if you will say that the Government can appeal from the pre-trial dismissal, that will only discourage defendants from making their motion prior to trial and they will only delay it until jeopardy has attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.418" offset="11713076">Well, of course that whatever merit may be that that consideration of policy however doesn't answer the question here since Congress has authorized the appeal and has made the determination of policy itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.751" offset="11766366">And has determined to permit that appeal here and of course second, if it does become a problem, this Court either through its rule making powers of Congress through a legislative action can provide and mandate that these motions be made prior to trial otherwise they’ll be deemed waived as is true now with motions directed to the defect in the institution of the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.790" offset="11866572">So that essentially the Finley case, the United States against Finley involved policy considerations that are no longer open to this Court to consider since Congress has decided itself that it wants the United States to have the right to appeal from these pre-trial dismissals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.901" offset="11938983">Moreover, there really isn't any reason to depart from this long line of precedent to overrule any number of decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.790" offset="11978480">None of the considerations which are reflected by the Double Jeopardy Clause are really applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.737" offset="11998333">The defendant was not put through any burden and expense and trauma of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.374" offset="12016828">He was not put through a hearing or determination of fact which could have resulted in a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.458" offset="12041174">All that occurred here was little more than the argument of a legal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.509" offset="12057370">As a matter of fact, there was a good deal less here than that which occurs at a suppression hearing where the judges actually hear evidence where they make the determinations of credibility and where their decision on whether to admit or not to admit a particular piece of evidence could very well be decisive of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.258" offset="12124453">Here, all that took place was an argument on a motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.410" offset="12140962">The Selective Service file of course is contained undisputed facts which is true in every Selective Service case, the defendant rarely ever disputes that he failed to report his order and his only defense can be based on something that maybe in the Selective Service file.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.831" offset="12198745">So, that the facts were never in dispute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.175" offset="12208044">There was no trial of any issue of fact and the defendant had not been placed in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.890" offset="12226957">And for these reasons, we believe there is no reason to deny and to defeat the intent of Congress to authorize the appeal here or to overrule a long line of decisions of this Court and we therefore ask that the judgment of the Court of Appeals be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3210.376" offset="12944906">I would just say that once again I sensed that the Government, so many of us have to know, you just but too much emphasis on labels and that we really ought to look at the function of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.576" offset="13001644">What is a trial in terms of the burden and expense and emotional strain?</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.133" offset="13023901">It doesn't have really to be -- I'm suggesting that jeopardy in that sense arises well before a jury is impaneled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.168" offset="13056084">And with the modern methods of disposing off issues before a Court prior to the impaneling of the jury, we don't need to read these things so narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.054" offset="13095581">I would also just respond to the closing statement made by Mr. Korman, in reference to the sophisticated and I will be kind -- the sophisticated defense counsel who waits until a jury has been impaneled to bring his motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.034" offset="13175515">He says that this Court by its rule making could probably require these motions be made prior to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.972" offset="13203310">I would not be so hasty to conclude that, I would assume that a rule of that kind would require a great amount of public discussion before it could be even considered for adoption.</text>
