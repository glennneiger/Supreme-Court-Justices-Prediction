            <text syncTime="17.645" offset="70531">For the No. 1123, the Feola case is one that comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.472" offset="105848">The respondent Feola and others were convicted in a jury trial violating a federal statute for having assaulted federal undercover narcotics agents in the performance of their official duties and of violating still another statute for conspiring to commit that offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.508" offset="185992">The trial court, it instructed the jury that in order to find any of the defendants guilty on either the conspiracy count or the substantive count the jury was not required to conclude that the defendants were aware that their victims were federal agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.873" offset="255478">The Court of Appeals approved the instructions on the substantive charge but relying on an old Second Circuit case reversed the conspiracy convictions on the ground that knowledge of the official identity of the victim must be proved in order to convict of a conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.656" offset="330606">The facts reveal a typical narcotics rip off when the federal officers closed in on the respondent and his associates.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.775" offset="362998">They were in civilian clothes and had been assumed by the respondent to be buyers rather than federal agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.710" offset="390792">In an opinion filed today we hold that knowledge of the identity of the victim is not necessary for a federal conviction for either the substantive charge or the conspiracy charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.736" offset="438857">And the judgment of the Court of Appeals insofar as it concerns the conspiracy is therefore reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.828" offset="467278">I'm authorized to say that Mr. Justice Stewart has filed a dissenting opinion and is joined in that opinion by Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
