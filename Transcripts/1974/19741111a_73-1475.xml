            <text syncTime="32.153" offset="231946">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.047" offset="247515">This case is on appeal from a three-judge court decision of the Southern District of Texas declaring first a Texas statute Article 2351 1/2 (c) unconstitutional and enjoining so much of a Commissioner's Court redistricting order which had the necessary effect under the statute of terminating the terms of office of five officeholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.081" offset="359737">Three of whom were justices of the peace and two constables.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.329" offset="376665">The facts of the case briefly are as follows: On March 12, 1973 the Commissioners Court of Harris County appointed a committee of nine persons to study the redistricting of both the county's commissioner precincts as well as its justice of the peace precincts.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.768" offset="470392">That committee consisted of a County Commissioner who himself had served for ten years in the state legislature and on the committee in the legislature for the redistricting measures which had been taken by the Texas legislature during his tenure in office.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.897" offset="550954">It also includes a justice of the peace, a constable, a Republican or a member of the Republican Party in the county, a member of the Democratic Party in the county, a Negro, a Mexican-American and a woman as well as another or as well a University of Houston professor who had some expertise in redistricting and I might also add that the County Commissioner was and is a professor at the University of St. Thomas in Houston and heads the Political Science Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.834" offset="702673">After more than two months of study of the necessity for redistricting in Harris County, that committee recommended to the Commissioners Court a redistricting plan for the Commissioners Court which the Commissioners Court implemented and it met the strict requirements of Avery.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.620" offset="801834">Two weeks after that it recommended a redistricting plan for the justices of the peace precinct and the Commissioners Court shortly thereafter with a plan somewhat different from the plan recommended by the committee and it was primarily authored by the Commissioner on the Commissioners Court and who had served on the committee, implemented the plan of redistricting of the justice of the peace precincts.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.341" offset="908727">Now, the justice of the peace precincts prior to the redistricting plan being put into effect had two justices in one precinct and one justice in each of the other precincts.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.647" offset="1157935">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.783" offset="1170474">The Commissioners Court's order of redistricting again was passed by that Court on June 28th, 1973 to become effective July 1, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.921" offset="1227107">In many reasons stated by the three Commissioners who formed the three-nine majority in effecting this redistricting order are detailed at page 5 of the appellant's brief and of course the primary reason for the redistricting in question was the gross disparities existing between various precincts as they existed prior to the redistricting action in question and I would invite the Court's attention to exhibits E and F of the appellant's brief which sets out on page 58, the precinct met as it existed before the redistricting in question and on Page 59, the redistricting or redistricted precincts after the order was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.507" offset="1425429">The Court will know that in the precincts 4, 5, 6 and 7 there were population counts of 81,000, 6,900, 8,800, 11,976 for 4, 5, 6, and 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.843" offset="1494706">As a result of the redistricting and the attempt by the commissioners to make the precincts more reasonably apportioned of necessity required the combining of these precincts to make up one precinct and that is what happened in coming up with new precinct four as the Court will note on the opposite page, page 59 and there would be no problem except that Article 2351 1/2 (c) which is the statute in question here provides that following a redistricting where you have such a situation just as this, where as a result of combining precincts to form one precinct and you have an excess number or surplusage of either JP's or constables for the limited number of positions in the new precinct and in this case we had only two authorized JP's and one constable.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.680" offset="1742137">We ended up as a result of necessarily combining these various precincts to come up with a more reasonably apportioned precinct, three justices of the peace to fill the two justice positions and two constables to fill the one constable position.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.174" offset="1816116">As a result of that, the Commissioners Court under the statute Article 2355, first 2351 1/2 (c) declares these positions in the new precinct vacant as a result of that factual situation and as a result of that, the Commissioners Court is authorized to fill those vacancies which it proceeded to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.123" offset="1907858">It appointed one of the three justices of the peace of the former precincts to fill the one of the two new positions and one of the constables to fill the one constable position.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.542" offset="1969507">It reached outside of the area of the former constables or justices of the peace to fill the other justice position and it chose a lawyer to do that with.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.092" offset="2023737">The justice of the peace of the former precinct that it chose to fill the other position was one with some 16-1/2 year service as a justice of the peace of the former precinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.006" offset="2075355">Now, as a result of the effect of the statute and the effect of these facts that meant that these five officeholders, the appellees in this case had their terms of office terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.642" offset="2133974">The two constables in the course, had some 2-1/2 years to run until December 31, 1976 and the three justices of the peace had until December 31 of this year and which to fill out their terms of office.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.128" offset="2203878">They, as a result, of this action of redistricting and the effect of 2351 1/2 (c) on the day that the redistricting order was passed filed suit in State District Court in Harris County, Texas and on the following day I would amend that one of the five individual officers filed a suit and that was appellee Moore.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.401" offset="2305024">On the following day, the District Court denied a temporary injunction and without further prosecuting their remedy in the state Courts, they then filed suit in the federal court on July 20th of 1973 and --</text>

            <text syncTime="603.999" offset="2519333">I think that contention was answered, Your Honor in the case of Whitmarsh against Buckley which of course you set out in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.270" offset="2552456">In Whitmarsh against Buckley, the Court explained in distinguishing the right of a commissioner to continue to serve after a redistricting which places his residence outside of the precinct from which he was elected and a situation where there were school district trustees who by reason of de-annexation had been placed outside of the school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.095" offset="2659767">They Court of Civil Appeals in that case declared that there was a valid distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.812" offset="2686621">Commissioners are not precinct officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.271" offset="2700413">They are not elected from the precinct in which they are to reside to represent only the people who reside in that precinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.446" offset="2737194">They are elected to represent the people of the entire county whereas in this case the constable and the two justices of the peace of each precinct are elected to represent only the people in the particular precinct in which they are elected to serve.</text>

            <text syncTime="1309.036" offset="5339512">For instance, in one precinct there may well be a greater crime rate which would require greater work load of the constable as well as the two justices of the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.640" offset="5393951">There is of course the geography, the matter of square mileage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.258" offset="5416417">There are any number of factors which the Commissioners Court would consider in arriving at the shape and the size of the new precincts of these kind of new precincts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.353" offset="5476812">But in addition to intending that the state does indeed have a compelling state interest to sustain the particular statute in question that is the precinct residency requirement of these various offices and we of course cited and quoted from in our brief the case of Hadnott against Amos, an Alabama case involving circuit judges of that state which this Court affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.663" offset="5582033">In addition to that compelling interest, we would submit that the District Court should have abstained in this particular case for the reason that there are state constitutional questions, state constitutional considerations which if decided by the Texas Supreme Court would give all of the -- in appellees' favor would avoid the federal constitutional question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1410.818" offset="5746604">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.215" offset="5760188">May I just state one short comment in regard to the totality of the atmosphere of this redistricting order, Your Honors and then get very specifically holding in on the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.893" offset="5810970">This redistricting order which took place by three-two vote of a democrat majority of three democrats on the Commissioners Court took place in quite an unusual set of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.672" offset="5854020">There was a committee that has been mentioned by the counsel for the petitioner who had supposedly met and they came up with seven or eight plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.739" offset="5886307">On the night or the eve of the date in which this order was passed, Commissioner Bass by himself according to the testimony in the appendices here designed a new plan at night, did not inform the other commissioners of it, walked into the Court and presented and they passed it 3-2 to go into effect three days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.144" offset="5959973">I represent Judge Zaboroski who was only the Republican justice of the peace elected at that time in Harris County since reconstruction days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.157" offset="5987976">In our pleadings, when we decided to seek the forum proper to the relief at which we felt we were entitled, we filed suit under both civil rights and of statutes under those in Title 42, 1983, 1985, and Title 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.756" offset="6050356">We filed also for the dilution in the abasement of the vote of the class of voters within the respective precincts and the unequal treatment of the voters in the same class and particularly for political discrimination against the minority party in the county habitually, traditionally and till date controlled by the Democrat Party and even more fundamentally the unusual and unbelievable circumstance at this time and space and at this time in circumstance, are the use of racial discrimination to create enclaves within the city which is an admission in the deposition testimony in the appendices that they were setting up these racial enclaves to assure that certain members of certain and only certain ethnic and racial groups would be able to be elected at office and to succeed themselves in office and of course then malapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.432" offset="6261112">The precincts were not, in fact, brought back into line with any serious attempt that the Avery rule of “one man, one vote” and now the disparity is still is bad as it was.</text>

            <text syncTime="2047.370" offset="8292812">I did want to address myself to one of the first questions I asked as to my client and several others as to whether the relief sought would become moot and I would call the Court's attention to the Texas Constitution itself Article 5, Section 18 wherein it sets out the absolute authority and the mandate of authority to the Commissioners Court and it provides in each precinct there should be one elected justice of the peace and one constable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.821" offset="8390614">Each of whom shall hold this office for a four-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.724" offset="8406288">It says for four years in common and until his successor shall have been elected and qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.792" offset="8434500">Now, in regard to whether or not this becomes moot, if this statute is found facially unconstitutional then the officeholders unlawfully removed from office who are still under the Constitution of Texas itself entitled to and/or the lawful office and they can remain in that position until the county commissioners see fit either to fill that vacancy or to provide an election as the Constitution says at the next general election, so its' not a moot question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.851" offset="8546826">Now, the question of whether or not it should be remanded because of the nature of the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.141" offset="8571904">Article 5, Section 24 is definitive in my judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.079" offset="8591653">It says removal of county officers, in other words, the Constitution of the state of Texas at its inception defined who were county officers and it says county judges, county attorneys, clerks of a district and county courts, justice of the peace, constables and other county officers including justices and constables may be removed and they set the method of removal and nowhere does the Constitution say that they can be removed by any other body for any other purpose than the constitutional reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.048" offset="8715577">And what we have here with the statute setting by legislative edict, additional manners of removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.793" offset="8746506">It also sets by legislative edict, the manner in which the justices shall be left in office or taken out of office, none of which conforms to the removal section of the Constitution and none of which is consistent with it but rather in contravention of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.793" offset="8814529">Now, the primary objection to this statute on its face is that where three people of the same class were elected officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.604" offset="8853817">My client who was removed from office, client B who remained by happenstance or by deliberation when the lines were drawn, which we must not ignore the political realities of life in this case, or third where two people who was there and remained but had to go out because two of them resided in the precinct where only one went, so they both were declared vacant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.859" offset="8938768">So, we have three people all elected justices of the peace under this order who were treated in three entirely different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.344" offset="8968756">One remains in office, two are removed and then of course the same thing applies to the voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.052" offset="8995610">There is no question whether voters in one precinct vote for their man and then find out that this could happen again next week, incidentally they have the power to redistrict at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.771" offset="9042422">The only provision is that very, very general statement for the convenience of the people and the reasons given in this case by the appellant, petitioner here simply were after the fact reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.053" offset="9111594">They were specified publicly but in truth and in fact they did little to accomplish what they wanted except in two areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.182" offset="9140120">They got the people they wanted in office and they created the minority, ethnic enclaves of two groups that would politically help them in office which is graphically reflected and I don't think can be controverted in the appendices of the deposition of the majority commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.243" offset="9196335">Now, there's one of the thing I'd like to call the Court's attention to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.493" offset="9213367">My time is just about up and that is the day before the three-judge court ruled, the Texas Attorney General who is not here defending this case, even though it has statewide application to every county in Texas ruled in an advisory opinion and its only advisory does not have the standing of law that justices of the peace and constable was elected to full term are entitled to serve the entire four years and a redistricting of that precincts by the County Commissioners Court resulting in a justice or constable not living in his precinct does not vacate his office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.117" offset="9335829">Obviously, they read the constitutional provisions are addressed to the Court, also the rulings in relation to the Commissioners Court in an attempt to have equal treatment of officer within the same area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.621" offset="9389850">And we say because of these three variances both as to voters and as to persons within the same class that this statute on its face, in itself, is unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2503.429" offset="10117099">To further answer some of the questions that the Court apparently has in regard to whether or not the Texas law can solve some of the problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.380" offset="10144893">I would like to give the Court a brief history of the prior law, prior to 1965 when 2351 1/2 (c) came in to existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.018" offset="10179480">Article 5, Section 18 which is the state constitutional provision governing the justice of the peace and constables and commissioners was adapted by the residents of State of Texas in 1876 and that Constitution is still in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.017" offset="10247398">In 1895, we had a definitive decision by the Supreme Court of Texas interpreting Article 5, Section 18 on a matter of redistricting justice of the peace and constables.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.495" offset="10297344">I have cited the case in my brief, Your Honors and that case is titled Rigsby v. Dowlen, of course, decided by the Supreme Court of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.939" offset="10331094">Again in 1922, in the case titled William v. Castleman, the Supreme Court further interpreted Article 5, Section 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.548" offset="10365576">Now, both of these cases, both by highest appellate courts in the State of Texas concluded that when justice of the peace and constable precincts are redistricted, when the old precincts seized to exist and the new order becomes effective that the new offices come into existence vacant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.171" offset="10444048">Now then, to relieve some of the harsh effects of the Supreme Court decisions interpreting Article 5, Section 18, the legislature in 1965 passed 2351 1/2 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.612" offset="10497860">One problem that we have had and we have had to resort to the Federal Court is because of the prior rulings of the Supreme Court of the State of Texas, if we were to attack in a state court the provisions of 2351 1/2 (c) which we would have necessity have to do because that's a tool that was used by the county in removing the appellees from office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.285" offset="10588557">Assume that we were successful in our attack challenging the constitutionality of 2351 1/2 (c) before a Texas Court, the Supreme Court, then the doctrine of stare decisis would re-implement the decisions of Williams v. Castleman and the Rigsby case of 1895 and their interpretation of Article 5, Section 18 leaving the appellees in a worst position that they were prior to challenging 2351 1/2 (c).</text>

            <text syncTime="2749.273" offset="11100453">I believe that that matter was attacked in the lower court but the three-judge panel did not address itself to all of the issues that were raised at that level and they in fact concluded on two particular issues with reference to Equal Protection and Due Process of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.732" offset="11174327">One being that the legislative classification where you have one officer who stays in office simply because of where he lives after redistricting and another is removed simply because of where he lives after redistricting, that that Act in itself is invidious and discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.640" offset="11245902">And their second holding would be that the Due Process clause guarantees the right to vote, that the right to vote is a fundamental right and that the Act which would cut short or abridge the right of the voter by cutting short the term of the office of the elected official violate the Due Process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3247.890" offset="13094954">In this particular case, the commissioners made no bones about the aim as one of the objectives of this redistricting to promote minority participation and to that end they did in fact, in a precinct with some 35% Latin-American population appoint a Latin-American constable as well as two justices of the peace of Latin-American extraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.351" offset="13212818">Also, with regard to precinct number 7 in which had a 58.4% black population, they appointed one Negro constable and two Negro justices of the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.357" offset="13264750">We would submit to the Court that that objective of many that are set out at Page 5 of the appellant's brief is a laudable on the part of the Commissioners Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.414" offset="13316995">With respect to Mr. Friloux and Mr. Gilleland's contentions that Article 5, Section 24 of the Constitution that is the State Constitution classifies these officers as county officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.720" offset="13390242">That may well be true but in the Whitmarsh against Buckley case which is a Court of Civil Appeals case no written history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.446" offset="13425142">The fact of the matter is there the Court classed school district trustees as county officers and yet they applied Article 105 of the Election Code to say that they were confined to residency within the school district which was an area less in size than the county as a whole and whether or not these individuals or county officers we would submit is not a question for this Court to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.438" offset="13553142">It is a question truly for the Texas Courts to decide as to whether or not these officers or county officers under the state constitution and whether or not they should be treated the same as the County Commissioners in Section B of the statute.</text>
