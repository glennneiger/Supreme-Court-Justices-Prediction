            <text syncTime="65.820" offset="366634">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.294" offset="380531">This case is before the Court on a writ of certiorari to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.977" offset="403310">The District Court, Western District of New York, originally dismissed the complaint on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.438" offset="429119">None of the petitioners had alleged standing to sue and that no claim was stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.067" offset="451688">The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirms solely on the ground that none of the petitioners have standing to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.516" offset="481468">Thus, the record before this Court consists only of the complaints of the plaintiffs, the motion papers of the respondents on the motion to dismiss and the affidavits in opposition to that motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.786" offset="542490">The record then as it stand must be reviewed by assuming that all of the material allegations of the complaints are true and that the complaints must be read in the light most favorable to the construction of those allegations by the complainant and to grant any relief that could be possibly granted with the fair and liberal reading of that complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.043" offset="635591">The basic complaint of the petitioners is that the zoning ordinance of the Town of Penfield, New York on its face and as applied is illegal and unconstitutional being racially discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.620" offset="705808">The question before this Court is whether any of the petitioners have alleged injury in fact and that injury being within a zone of interest of a constitutional or statutory provision which the petitioners alleged that the respondents have violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.764" offset="786474">The petitioners before the Court are basically three groups or three categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.572" offset="817612">First of all, the petitioners are low and moderate minority income persons who claim that they had been forbidden or excluded from residing in the Town of Penfield by the operation of the Town of Penfield racially exclusionary zoning ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.504" offset="889396">Secondly, the petitioners are organizations and associations of persons whose members have been actively involved in efforts to amend the zoning ordinance of the Town of Penfield to permit the construction of low moderate multi-racial income housing there, or who have actually made proposals for the construction of such housing in the Town of Penfield all to know avail.</text>

            <text syncTime="231.191" offset="1028159">Well, Your Honor, our contention is that the home builders and other private builders and entities have actually made proposals in the form of housing construction which would be within a range which can be purchase by low and moderate multi-racial persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.026" offset="1115512">The town has arbitrarily refused to grant variances, exceptions and so forth to a very rigid zoning ordinance which dictates the construction only of very expensive and exclusive housing, so that the application of the zoning ordinance dictates a racial stratification and population.</text>

            <text syncTime="290.626" offset="1265873">Yes Your Honor, and let me clarify that.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.255" offset="1276426">The Second Circuit Court of Appeals in its decision suggested that there really weren't that kind of concrete proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.962" offset="1311222">I submit, Your Honor, that that is a misreading of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.118" offset="1327835">The fact is that both the Rochester Home Builders and other entities such as Penfield Better Homes which is a member of petitioner Housing Council have actually tried to have such construction approved in the Town of Penfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.256" offset="1400351">All of those efforts have been denied, all those applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.232" offset="1416338">The Penfield Better Homes application to rezone was denied by the town on the basis that the housing was not appropriate or consistent with the use of the adjacent properties, which is single family dwelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.412" offset="1477047">I think this case falls beyond eventhough its other cases which the Second Circuit suggested are concrete housing proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.586" offset="1517693">All efforts here have been totally frustrated, the far worst situation to name those other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.568" offset="1541622">And I might point out with respect to the Rochester Home Builders, they allege in their complaint, not only have they made these various and numerous applications for exception to the zoning ordinance, but that the Town of Penfield has threatened that if they pursue this lawsuit, if they try to rectify the exclusionary zoning ordinance that they will not be allowed to do business in the ordinary course of doing business with the public officials of the town in the ordinary course of construction of exclusive housing in the town.</text>

            <text syncTime="406.829" offset="1730644">But the mere fact that they did not pursue that course, of course, does not prevent them from proceeding as a part of a membership organization to the federal court to get redress for these illegal acts pursuant to the statutes and the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="453.668" offset="1917994">And the immediate preceding acts on -- the acts immediately preceding the filing of this complaint were specific and concrete proposals of another organization Metro-Act of Rochester for the Town of Penfield to amended zoning ordinance so that this construction could take place.</text>

            <text syncTime="1895.842" offset="7686771">But there's not a single application for such a permit except by one of the association members whose not a plaintiff and who is not a party -- doesn't seek to be a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.375" offset="7748838">Now, we're talking about a very broad constitutional affect that this Court should rule, concerning these -- allowing these plaintiffs to have standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.106" offset="7815816">Because we're talking about the Fourteenth Amendment, we are to talk in terms of what specifically that these plaintiffs do to create a fact context which would indicate to the Court that the Fourteenth Amendment has indeed been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.352" offset="7892825">Without these facts, what can we work with?</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.448" offset="7909125">What relief will we give?</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.909" offset="7914977">Will the relief -- first of all, the adjudication maybe unnecessary because on an application for some kind of relief from the zoning ordinance, it might very well be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.197" offset="7960116">If it's denied, at least some controversy, some confrontation with the town or its administrative agencies would have taken place to give a factual context within which to make a constitutional determination of this import.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.496" offset="8029393">Now right now, none of these affidavits indicate that any plaintiff wants to live in Penfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.556" offset="8049560">One says, “I might want to live there”, that's Ortiz's affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.549" offset="8065546">Reyes doesn't mention wanting to live in the Penfield or that they will live in Penfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.292" offset="8088534">Have they been injured or is this allegation and their position totally speculative?</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.382" offset="8116851">Because if the relief were granted which they seek, the abolition in effect of the Penfield zoning ordinance, would these individual plaintiffs receive themselves any substantial relief?</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.807" offset="8174634">And have they been injured?</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.065" offset="8179649">They have a personal state in the outcome of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.161" offset="8196054">If they haven't alleged, they try to get into Penfield or that they even desire to get into Penfield?</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.532" offset="8221550">Isn't this kind of like O'Shea against Littleton where the relief they had ripened into a position to be relieved by any judgment?</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.418" offset="8269093">And I think we have to look at this manner from the vantage point of the complaint and overlook, the litigation that would take place to the outcome of that litigation and determine in order to determine standing whether that outcome would in effect affect these plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.409" offset="8352998">Now, I'd like to go if I may to the association of plaintiffs and what I've said concerning the individual plaintiffs applies to the associational petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.308" offset="8396570">One is a plaintiff, Metro-Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.967" offset="8407228">One, there was -- there was a motion made to bring in the Housing Council of the Monroe County Area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.344" offset="8440769">Now, that motion was denied because standing was denied for all the other petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.973" offset="8463235">And the motion is sort of surrounded by some procedural vagary because it doesn't refer to Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which indicate when a party should be joined as a plaintiff and/or as a defendant depending on the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.494" offset="8529377">In any event, the motion to bring them in is denied and they seek to be made a party plaintiff, and it is that Housing Council which refers to Penfield Better Homes who is not a party and doesn't seek to be a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.961" offset="8603251">Now, the Housing Council is basically an association of associations and public agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.901" offset="8638986">The Penfield Better Homes did indeed at one time apply for a project called Highland Circle in the Town of Penfield and sought variances or permits or actually I think an amendment to the zoning ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.147" offset="8695933">It was denied and that -- as a matter of fact, it was denied in 1969, September of 1969, and then on -- a rehearing was had in November of '69, and on January 12, 1970, there was a denial of any further public hearing and these are in the appendix at pages 631, 881, and 883.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.623" offset="8805857">Now, for two years, Penfield Better Homes did nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.252" offset="8828426">They have done nothing yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.581" offset="8837726">Housing Council is moved to be brought into the case and uses Penfield Better Homes as an incident to give stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.402" offset="8877014">But Housing Council has no complaint in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.570" offset="8889657">If Housing Council were allowed to remain standing as a party to this action, there are no allegations because they have not yet put in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.289" offset="8940544">Now, is Housing Council derivatively in a better position to pursue these rights than is Penfield Better Homes who had lawyers made the application was turned down and was turned down on three grounds: erosion problems, traffic problems, and that the project was inconsonant with the surrounding neighborhood, which is a general and classical way that variances and rezonings are turned down in towns that inconsonant with the neighborhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.466" offset="9089233">If they didn't bring the action, are we to assume that that was done on racially discriminatory grounds?</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.077" offset="9115669">If Penfield Better Homes for two and a half years and today has not instituted any kind of action or proceeding in either the state courts in the State of New York or in federal court alleging anything no less racially discriminatory conduct or a racially discriminatory effect of the zoning ordinance to Town of Penfield is Housing Council derivatively to assert that through an affidavit of Mrs. McNab who is not yet a party and has no complaint?</text>

            <text syncTime="3195.699" offset="12886183">I don't think there is a specific out of pocket injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3230.340" offset="13024737">There has been no good faith showing of a pocket book injury, there are some figures that taxes have gone up, but it only gone up all over not only in the City of Rochester.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.364" offset="13064861">How are you going to compare that or assert that's a result of Penfield zoning ordinance, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.148" offset="13103940">As I said, this is a very -- a decision here giving standing in this case would have some very, very broad far reaching and sweeping effects on the municipalities of 50 states; this is a typical zoning ordinance, pretty typical zoning ordinance and so found by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.232" offset="13216266">There's a fair of any of these plaintiffs or petitioners to show a personal state in the outcome of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3300.022" offset="13303411">I think it misses the point so clearly made in Baker against Carr that such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assume that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the courts so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions is missing here.</text>
