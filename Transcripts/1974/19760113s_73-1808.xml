            <text syncTime="8.638" offset="117569">First of these cases is 73-1808, Laing against the United States and the second is 74-75, United States versus Hall, here are on writs of certiorari to the Second and Sixth Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.839" offset="174411">These cases involve two taxpayers whose taxable years were terminated by the Internal Revenue Service prior to the normal expiration dates, pursuant to the jeopardy termination provisions, Section 6851 of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.987" offset="242956">This Section allows the IRS immediately to terminate a taxpayer’s taxable period when it finds that the taxpayer intended to commit any act tending to prejudice the collection of his income tax for the current or proceeding taxable year.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.124" offset="307531">In such cases, a tax is due immediately upon termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.204" offset="327802">In each of the instant cases, the IRS levied upon to seize the taxpayer’s property without sending any notice of deficiency, a jurisdictional prerequisite to a taxpayer’s refund suit in the Tax Court, and without following the other procedures mandated by Section 6861 of the Code, which prescribes for the procedure for the assessment and collection of deficiencies whose collection is in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.114" offset="431456">The Government contends that these procedures are not applicable to 6851, because such termination do not create the efficiency within the meaning of that word.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.303" offset="480253">In No. 73-1808, the District Court for the District of Vermont accepted the Government’s argument and held that a deficiency notice and the procedures of 6861 are not required for a 6851 termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.416" offset="544723">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.687" offset="557784">In the other case, 74-75, the District Court for the Western District of Kentucky granted the taxpayer relief, holding that the IRS must follow the 6861 procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.163" offset="607730">The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.154" offset="619642">We, therefore, granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.579" offset="637301">In an opinion filed today with clerk, we hold that the tax owing, but not reported at the time of 6851 termination, is a deficiency whose assessment and collection is subject to the procedures of 6861.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.265" offset="700099">Under the statutory definition of deficiency, the tax owing and unreported after jeopardy termination is clearly a deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.128" offset="735521">Moreover, to deny a taxpayer to litigate his tax liability in the Tax Court is out of keeping with the legislative scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.803" offset="770212">Analysis of the early codification of the Code confirms this conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.588" offset="789438">According to the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, No. 73-1808 is reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion and the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in No. 74-75 is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.529" offset="853177">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a concurring opinion and Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Rehnquist join.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.500" offset="901033">Mr. Justice Stevens took part in the consideration or decision of these cases.</text>
