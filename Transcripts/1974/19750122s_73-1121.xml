            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">The judgment and opinion of the Court in No. 73-1121, North Georgia Finishing Company against Di-Chem, Incorporated will be announced by Mr. Justice White.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="13.002" offset="51931">This is an appeal from the decision of the Georgia Supreme Court sustaining the Georgia prejudgment garnishment statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.423" offset="85682">That law permits a creditor suing his debtor to attach and put beyond use during the litigation certain property of the debtor in the hands of third persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.965" offset="123820">This was done by serving on a third person a writ of garnishment issued by a court clerk ex parte and at the behest of the creditor all without notice or hearing and without participation by a judicial officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.149" offset="172513">As explained in the opinion filed today, it is the Court's view that Georgia statute is invalid under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.519" offset="206054">That the Georgia Supreme Court failed to take account of this Court's decision in Fuentes against Shevin in 407 U.S. and that the later decision in Mitchell against Grant does not save the Georgia procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.095" offset="252343">Accordingly, the judgment below is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.832" offset="263314">Mr. Justice Stewart has filed a concurring statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.517" offset="273972">Mr. Justice Powell has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.280" offset="301035">Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Rehnquist has joined and in paragraph 5 of which the Chief Justice joins.</text>
