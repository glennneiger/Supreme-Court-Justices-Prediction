            <label>Mr. Robert W. Hagopian</label>
            <text syncTime="58.882" offset="338944">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.644" offset="361932">This case involves an appeal from a Municipal Court in Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.413" offset="393070">In Massachusetts, we have what's commonly known as a two-tier trial de novo system.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.552" offset="425566">There is a set of lower courts that is comprised with the district courts and the Municipal Court of Boston and there is a second tier in the de novo procedure which is basically the superior courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.689" offset="506128">The Superior Court and the district courts, or the lower courts have concurrent jurisdiction over the most crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.203" offset="540191">One limitation is that the first tier or the lower courts can only have jurisdictions over crimes which are punishable up to five years in the state prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.642" offset="585958">There are a few exceptions that go up to 10 years, burglary and breaking in and entering at nighttime.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.776" offset="618454">The district courts have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.283" offset="636531">In the district courts in Massachusetts as so construed by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, you cannot obtain a trial by jury in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.337" offset="696717">You have the option there of pleading not guilty and going to trial or you have the option of pleading guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.003" offset="727333">If you're convicted after you plead not guilty, you have supposedly an unqualified and unfettered right for a trial de novo in the second tier of the Massachusetts procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.777" offset="786474">If you plead guilty, you cannot get a trial de novo in the second tier.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.824" offset="810715">You may appeal the sentence itself, that is if you're imprisoned, the length of confinement but there is no trial in the second tier on the merits of the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.106" offset="863796">There is no procedure in the Massachusetts two-tier procedure for any appellate review of a decision in the lower court or lower tier.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.303" offset="912593">There are a number of collateral remedies that are available that is if you go to trial in the District Court and you're convicted and imprisoned, you may bring a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.640" offset="965883">There is another writ called the writ of error which is unlike the writ of error that used to come to this Court many years ago and it's what's normally known.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.060" offset="1007574">That writ of error is not available for any collateral relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.684" offset="1026069">It's an independent and distinct proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.868" offset="1038817">The third possibility is to petition to the Supreme Judicial Court for extraordinary relief under their supervisory powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.256" offset="1080404">Now, in this particular case, the appellant, Steven Costarelli requested a jury trial in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.374" offset="1116871">He was charged with a crime of which he could've received two years in prison and a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.781" offset="1142471">A trial judge denied that motion, notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Costarelli had asserted his specific constitutional rights and the right to a speedy trial which he interprets that meaning as speedy trial by jury or speedy trial that comports with constitutional standards and also his rights under the double jeopardy provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.667" offset="1238079">From the denial of that motion, he brought -- filed an appeal in this case and this case, the Court has set down the issue of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.019" offset="1275486">I submit to you, Your Honors that this Court has jurisdiction over an appeal from the Boston Municipal Court because that court is the highest state court within the meaning of those words in Section 1257.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.988" offset="1343300">That is, there is no further appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.902" offset="1358973">Massachusetts' argument to this case or to this point in jurisdiction is very simply that the appellant has the right to trial de novo and of course, that's what the basic issue about what this case is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.576" offset="1417697">In terms of jurisdiction, trial de novo is not an appeal on the record of the lower court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.984" offset="1447267">It grants a person a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.875" offset="1454895">There is no means of reversing errors that went on down in the lower court.</text>

            <text syncTime="341.787" offset="1470568">Mr. Hagopian, what if your client had been initially tried in the District Court on the same charge he wasn't acquitted and then he was tried again in the District Court and found guilty and you wanted to raise the claim of double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.651" offset="1530023">Could you raise that in the Superior Court on an appeal from that second verdict?</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="362.414" offset="1553011">Well, then why can't you raise your jury trial claim here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_w_hagopian" startTime="365.731" stopTime="413.151">
            <label>Mr. Robert W. Hagopian</label>
            <text syncTime="365.731" offset="1566281">Well, that of course is a very complicated question.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.145" offset="1579969">But the answer to that is that I think that it is this, that after he has gone up to the Superior Court and he raises -- he can raise the issue of double jeopardy in the form of a motion on that bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.970" offset="1619257">I don't believe he can collaterally attack what went down in the District Court of the denial of a jury trial is a pure reversible error.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.494" offset="1649351">It may be mooted by the fact that if the judge denies this motion to bar in the Superior Court and he's granted a jury trial and he's convicted there, then he's had a jury trial and the issue may be moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.025" offset="1695431">That is if you consider the fact that a denial of a jury trial is purely a reversible error for getting the double jeopardy claim with the speedy trial claim if it is purely a reversible error, it's been cured by the fact that he has a jury trial.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="413.151" offset="1755930">But then you could have I suppose under those circumstances after making your point in the Superior Court claiming the right to jury trial, they rule against you, at least brought it here from the Superior Court on the ruling on that motion rather than just from the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="426.705" offset="1810160">Yes, that's quite correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.891" offset="1814967">I have that issue now before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and that case is currently being litigated there but I don't think that that cuts away from this Court's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.175" offset="1856031">A man who's tried down in the District Court, the Municipal Court of Boston, he does not have to suffer a second trial before he can get appellate review in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.294" offset="1892498">That is the foundation of which this Court's jurisdiction is predicated under Section 1257.</text>

            <text syncTime="456.389" offset="1928965">He could've gotten a ruling on his motion in the Superior Court and before he ever went to trial in the Superior Court could've brought it here.</text>

            <text syncTime="464.536" offset="1961566">I don't believe that's correct because then it would not be a judgment from which an appeal could be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.104" offset="1983822">It was simply a denial of a motion.</text>

            <text syncTime="477.877" offset="2014856">He can only appeal under Section 1257 from a denial of a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.684" offset="2030111">That is from the final judgment of Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.068" offset="2039620">That would be piecemeal adjudication of the trial or the proceedings in the Superior Court and I don't believe the jurisdiction would lie under that procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1173.589" offset="4797733">In Colten, the record isn't transmitted up the Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.590" offset="4809749">It's a real true de novo system here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.896" offset="4822915">In the Massachusetts system, the judge and jury, everybody knows where these cases came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.192" offset="4844126">They know that the man has been convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.617" offset="4857814">In addition to that of course, the critical issue in Colten was that Colten was entitled to a trial by jury in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.740" offset="4894281">Let me just say briefly on the merits of this case, I think that the large issue, the broad issue in this case is not whether the rule of Callan versus Wilson is incorporated and the state should be bound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.392" offset="4940988">I think that the real broad issue in this case is whether the states have a right to deny a person a specific procedural constitutional right, whether it's the right to counsel or whether it's the right to an impartial judge or it's the right to a trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.402" offset="5004936">I don't believe it's any answer for the state to say, we will give you a trial de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.230" offset="5024266">I think a man is entitled to those rights in the first instance, right to counsel, right to trial by jury, right to an impartial judge and it's no answer on the part of Massachusetts or the other states to simply say we will give these to you after we've subjected you and you're forced with a stigma of a conviction of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.537" offset="5113501">Now, I don't -- I think trial de novo's have a legitimate place and purposes of administration of criminal justice in the state system and I'm not asking this Court to abolish trial de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.243" offset="5164387">All I'm asking them to do was to say that Massachusetts must do what Rhode Island has to do, that when a defendant comes before the District Court, if he doesn't want to proceed at that stage of the proceedings, he should have a right to circumnavigate that trial and go right to the Superior Court or the state has to give him a trial by jury in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.747" offset="5242337">That's the only thing that I'm asking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.918" offset="5251009">I'm not asking to take the whole to trial de novo system down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.824" offset="5266683">That request would have some serious consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.310" offset="5276609">If the state wants to give somebody a trial de novo as an equivalent to an appellate remedy, I think that's fine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1396.626" offset="5689866">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.076" offset="5699688">I believe that Mr. Justice Rehnquist has asked a single critical question with respect to the issue of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.388" offset="5728946">However by way of introductory overview, I would like to suggest to this Court that Massachusetts has presented a brief with five parts and hopefully we will argue today in five parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.776" offset="5774503">Those parts are first in accordance with Rule 16, the question of jurisdiction and by way of introduction, we suggest that this Court does not have jurisdiction because this appeal fails of the prerequisite statutory jurisdictional prerequisites in Section 1257.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.661" offset="5845974">Our second point will be that the Massachusetts jury procedure as it currently exists is a system which is basic and fundamental and is justifiable as adequate under the Fourteenth Amendment standards that have been enunciated by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.970" offset="5911280">Our third position as presented in the brief will be that the Massachusetts jury system as it presently is in practice is a procedure and system which provides for the function and purpose of jury trial in America as has been enunciated in standards and decisions by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.340" offset="6004694">Our fourth position will be that the right to a speedy trial is not properly an issue before this Court and our final position will be that double jeopardy and the claim of a violation of double jeopardy in this case is controlled by this Court's decision on Colten versus Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.184" offset="6084106">First with respect to the issue of jurisdiction, Massachusetts suggests that the prerequisites of Section 1257 have not been satisfied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1512.396" offset="6152965">The judgment of the state court must be final.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.443" offset="6165191">The judgment of the state court must be of the highest court in which a decision could be had and for purposes of appeal under subsection 2 of Section 1257, the constitutionality of a state statute must have been drawn in question with a determination in favor of its validity and Massachusetts suggests that each of these statutory prerequisites are missing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.945" offset="6287130">With respect to finality, this Court has stated that no self-enforcing formula can be defined as to determine when a state judgment can be final.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.817" offset="6334673">And as early as 1869, in the case of Thomson versus Dean, this Court implicitly rejected a mechanical application of a formula of finality speaking rather in terms of the degree of finality essential to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.543" offset="6401546">On page 5 of our brief, we have extracted from the decisions of this Court, principles that we suggest should go into a determination of the degree of finality and our primary principles upon which we suggest this issue should be determined are suggestions from the cases of Richfield Oil Corporation, Market Street Railway Company and Banks versus California which are all cited at page 5 and the criteria that we suggest are controlling are these, that the judgment -- the state judgment in order to be final must be an effective determination of the litigation and subject to no further review or correction in any other state tribunal, that is the first criteria and the second; that available appellate review within the State Court system be pursued if available.</text>

            <text syncTime="2996.087" offset="12087672">We have examined in our brief the colonial constitutional history of the original states and we find that the de novo system existed in Massachusetts dating from 1647, in New Hampshire from 1679, from Vermont, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Maine from the early 1700s.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.765" offset="12162382">We suggest that this constitutional colonial analysis in the brief is appropriate in view of the criteria that were used by this Court in Duncan versus Louisiana, the Williams case, the Apodaca case and the other recent cases in which this Court has considered the jury trial right with respect to state procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.696" offset="12238137">We have examined contemporary practices among the states as this Court did in Duncan versus Louisiana and the results are contained in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.362" offset="12276799">We have suggested that the Massachusetts jury procedure fulfills the function and purpose of jury, that is the interposition of the common sense judgment of the group of laymen between an accuser and his accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.502" offset="12325386">In this regard, we would respectfully direct the Court's attention to the brief of the amicus file by the Massachusetts Defenders Committee which I think says better than the appellee has said in its brief that far from being oppressive, indeed the particular Massachusetts jury procedure system in question here may even contraindicate inconvenience let alone governmental oppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.797" offset="12426533">Finally, we have suggested that the speedy trial right is not an issue in this case as there is no measurable period of delay by which this Court can assess a delay in the terms of the criteria of Barker versus Wingo and we have suggested that the Massachusetts procedure is not violative of double jeopardy in view of this Court's decision in Colten versus Kentucky.</text>
