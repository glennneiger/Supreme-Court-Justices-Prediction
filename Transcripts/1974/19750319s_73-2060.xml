            <text syncTime="8.660" offset="34586">In this case, the appellants, residents of Maine have challenged a New Hampshire Commuters Income Tax under which their income earned in New Hampshire is taxed while the earned income of New Hampshire residents no matter where earned are not taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.041" offset="104072">A prior decision of this Court established that in the area of taxation, the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV of the constitution required that non-residents be treated on terms of substantial equality with residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.710" offset="166766">The actual effect of the New Hampshire Commuters Tax however, if exact from the non-residents the wholly disproportionate share of the costs of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.471" offset="205845">Therefore, for reasons stated in an opinion filed today with the clerk, we hold the tax statute unconstitutional under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.955" offset="251820">Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
