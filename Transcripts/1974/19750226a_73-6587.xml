          <turn speaker="diana_a_steele" startTime="41.822" stopTime="152.084">
            <label>Ms. Diana A. Steele</label>
            <text syncTime="41.822" offset="270712">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.021" offset="283460">The issue on this appeal is whether Section 320.23 (c) of the New York Criminal Procedure Law which authorizes the trial of judge in the non-jury trial to preclude closing arguments, violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the right to counsel provision of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.723" offset="362245">The Section in issue here is contained in a provision, governing the nature and conduct of the non-jury trial and provides that the court may in its discretion permit the parties to deliver summations.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.734" offset="406340">It was passed in 1971 and prior to that date, no statute covered the conduct of the non-jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.944" offset="439150">In this case at the close of all the evidence, the counsel specifically requested to be heard on the facts on behalf of his client and the court invoking the statute, denied his request.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.637" offset="481886">Eight minutes later, he delivered the guilty verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.555" offset="493589">It's our position that the statute invoked is unconstitutional both by its face and as applied because it deprives the defendant of his due process right to be heard and his right to the effect of assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.755" offset="550431">I think it's basic to our adversary system of criminal justice that defendant has a right to be heard on his own behalf, and that that right is really inseparable from his right to be heard by counsel at every criminal -- at every critical stage of our trial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.776" offset="618454">I think this tenant is reflected in the historical development and protection of the right to closing arguments by the state courts, and I think it's also reflected in the decisions of this Court since Powell versus Alabama which have held that in certain of counsel's professional functions are inherent in the defendant's right to the guiding hand of counsel.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>

            <label>Ms. Diana A. Steele</label>
            <text syncTime="156.795" offset="730572">Well, I think that the court has discretion to stop closing argument and I think that his discretion is reviewable on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.963" offset="775189">This is the way it's been handled in the jury trial context where the right has been established really since that 1827, it was first to recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.822" offset="818657">And I think when the court cuts off closing argument, there maybe a colloquy demonstrating what more counsel wanted to say and wasn't able to say, and I think that that's readily reviewable on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.587" offset="881768">But the absolute preclusion of closing arguments doesn't include any indication of what counsel would have said were he permitted to, and I think that in this case, the statute authorizes that absolute preclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.118" offset="1015829">But it's my position that there is no situation in which the court can preclude summations all together and have that not constituted an abuse of discretion because it really is depriving the defendant of his right to be heard.</text>

            <text syncTime="307.277" offset="1332433">I think that would be a different situation Mr. Justice Brennan because in the trial -- in the appellate court, you have an opportunity to file a brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.454" offset="1373184">So, you do get to insure that the theory of your case is presented to the decision maker and you can ensure that that everything you want to present to them is presented.</text>

            <text syncTime="336.013" offset="1447476">The judges left with the disparate pieces of the evidence that the defendant is really left to the mercy of the judge to weigh all the evidence and then hopefully, to draw the inferences that counsel would have urged upon him had he had an opportunity to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1677.749" offset="6814386">I think it really deprives the defendant of the benefit of counsel's professional skill which I think this Court recognized in Brooks and in Ferguson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.541" offset="6849494">And finally, I think that is the right to closing argument, particularly in the non-jury trial is essential to the integrity of the fact finding process, where that fact finder is a single individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.047" offset="6899545">He's presumably fallible just like anybody else, and he may well be in an overburden court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.980" offset="6927339">I think that those are the three basic reasons why a statute which deprives appellant of that right is violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the counsel provision of the Sixth.</text>

            <text syncTime="1747.390" offset="7092955">It seems to me that there were issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.101" offset="7107793">One was the issue of alibi which turned the course upon the testimony of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.226" offset="7144260">The other issue was the -- and his employer who was I would say vague and evasive in his testimony as to when he saw him and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.211" offset="7192221">The other question I suppose would be bias, bias on the part of the complaining witness who said it happened to him and bias on part of the defendant seeking to avoid any consequences of his act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.376" offset="7260871">It would appear to me that the factual determinations in this case were simple and were of the kind that the authors of the statute had in mind when they drew the statute that a judge seeing the facts openly and plainly without any abuse of discretion could say “I choose not to hear.</text>

            <text syncTime="1925.692" offset="7806098">Now, it seems to me here that if there's a right of summation in this instance because of some kind of historical basis, it would seem to me that that right of summation would have to carry over into any fact finding process if we're to distinguish as to substance and not as to form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.527" offset="7925530">For example, we're now regularly besieged with the procedures on identification suppression, and so forth, voluntariness of confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.777" offset="7986448">If in each instance, not only is there a right to the hearing, but there's a right to sum up on the fact finding question, I think we can see that the overworked urban courts to which my dedicated adversary makes reference would be even more so if at the end of that fact finding process, there was an insistences a matter of right, I have a right to analyze, sum up, distinguish the most obvious of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.024" offset="8139421">So that I feel in this case therefore that we should not have to arrive at that conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2033.075" offset="8235656">It would appear to me that since, they had to be on record, they were placed on the record as to the rights that they were surrendering in accepting a non-jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.895" offset="8306918">These were spelled out I think by the trial judge which commendable detail that they selected that route, and if you will, made no comment whatsoever that I'm doing this, but remember Your Honor, I still want my right of summation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2091.110" offset="8467832">It's held to be an intelligent waiver in the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.687" offset="8482147">For example, if a waiver of indictment is had, I don't think that it's incumbent upon anyone to say to a defendant that when you waive indictment in the federal system and that -- by doing so, you waive your right to appear before the grand jury, you waive that possibility that the grand jury may not indict you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.028" offset="8607535">All of the consequences of these things when a man is represented by an attorney, I think are fairly presumed to be known to him, else what his attorney for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.636" offset="8725922">Now, it does seem to me Your Honors that the Singer against the United States has determined this matter in which it says that there -- in which the Court said that there is no federally recognized right to a criminal trial before a judge sitting alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.661" offset="8845981">And if the State of New York has set up a reasonable non-jury procedure, that that is a non-jury procedure which this defendant or this appellant elected to proceed to trial by.</text>

            <text syncTime="2286.931" offset="9251088">Thank you Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.727" offset="9254327">I want to thank the Court for the kind indulgence in accepting our brief quite like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.537" offset="9277524">On behalf of the Attorney General of the State of New York Your Honor, the only question here is whether or not there's a federally protected right to sum up in a non-jury case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.911" offset="9327052">New York -- whether the right exist in the jury case and not New York recognizes that right, there’s a unconditional right in New York to sum up in a jury case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.395" offset="9372923">There's a constitutional right to trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.324" offset="9384626">There is no constitutional right to trial without a jury under the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.720" offset="9414301">The right is granted by the New York state constitution, but you can't engraft on into the federal constitution a state constitutional right of that as I believe Mr. Justice White pointed out in Laigus against Kumi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.662" offset="9490056">I would point out that this Court has specifically pointed out that there is no such constitutional right to trial without a jury under the federal constitution, and I believe that the court's, state's courts rules that may provide for a non-jury trial and as pointed out in Singer, there maybe reasonable, procedural requirements tied in with that waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.899" offset="9614921">Now, if we start from the premise that there is no federal constitutional right to sum up in a non-jury case, we don't' even have to reach the fact whether or not there is a knowing waiver under New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.423" offset="9681063">And I might point out that this question of abuse of discretion was never raised in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.582" offset="9725680">If it had been raised in the state courts, it would have and could have been considered by the state appellate courts as to whether or not the judge properly refused to take summation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.702" offset="9786180">This was a very simply case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.412" offset="9797047">It was very carefully considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.875" offset="9810840">It considered by the Court even as pointed out by defendant's counsel, very copious notes were taken and it's right in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.476" offset="9837275">At the end of the People's case, the charge of the Class D felony of possession of a dangerous instrument, that was dismissed at the end of the People's case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2467.479" offset="9973321">True it only took the judge eight minutes to decide, he found him not guilty on the most serious crime and found him guilty on the lesser crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.066" offset="10019610">So, there certainly was very careful consideration and what summation would add in a non-jury case, especially in the facts here, what right was he deprived off?</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.154" offset="10095992">I think this is very similar to the right of allocution which was considered by this Court in Hill against the United States, 368 U.S. 424 in 1962, where this Court held that the failure of the court to permit the defendant to be heard prior to sentencing in and off itself was an error which was neither jurisdictional or constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.965" offset="10227231">And certainly, whether or not the court permits summation in a non-jury case, it does not taking away a constitutional right from him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2577.006" offset="10411447">And what would be -- there might be some gain on the part of a judge listening to summation, but there's no constitutional right being taken away because no constitutional right exist in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.252" offset="10516355">And furthermore in New York, a defendant who does waive trial by jury also may waive his unconditional right to sum up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.344" offset="10600782">If that right of summation is such that he considers it so valuable and that the facts of the case are such that require summation, all he has to do is insist on his constitutional right to trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.676" offset="10662118">And we submit that there is no federal constitutional right to sum up in the first instance in a non-jury case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.069" offset="10695659">and if such fact, and if such right should exist which we do not concede, the fact that the New York statute makes it discretionary as to whether or not to permit summation, the waiver -- inherent in the waiver of trail by jury is also a waiver of the unconditional right to sum up in a non-jury case.</text>
