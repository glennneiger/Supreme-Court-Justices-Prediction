            <text syncTime="16.865" offset="170820">I think that initially I should review the facts which were scantly reviewed yesterday because there seems to be some misapprehension as to what actually took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.232" offset="228289">Appellees herein where owners and operators of premises in which food and liquor was served; one for a period of eight years, one for a period of five years and one for a period of about two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.363" offset="292864">At the time the town of North Hempstead passed its ordinance, during that period, they had offered their patrons topless dancing entertainment.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.650" offset="366007">The ordinance forbade the appearance in any public place and underlying any public place of a person with the breast uncovered or with the lower part of the torso uncovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.714" offset="446255">This was the broadest imaginable prohibition, it covered every place in the town of North Hempstead and it specifically covered any scene, sketch, act, or entertainment.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.616" offset="509785">In that regard, it was clearly affecting a theatrical performance presumptively protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.977" offset="551267">Now, to -- [Voice Overlap] -- it wasn't covering anything but live people.</text>

            <text syncTime="133.792" offset="638516">They did not offer topless bartenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.538" offset="653563">What they had was, a real stage, segregated from the patrons on which professional dancers were employed throughout the day to offer dancing entertainment.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.339" offset="712704">These professional dancers were hired through theatrical agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.257" offset="736423">Some of them were employed in ballet work in the City of New York and did this to earn extra money.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.420" offset="773099">This wasn't a situation of -- which was alluded to in LaRue I believe to (Inaudible) in a place it served liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.857" offset="838823">Now, the appellants herein maintain in page 12 their brief the method exercised by the legislative body to ensure the health, safety and well-being of the community is not a proper subject for review by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.946" offset="935163">I don't know whether they're serious or not serious in that contention but it would seem that the statute was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.044" offset="967555">The ordinance was enacted under this theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.493" offset="981347">It seems that they denied the existence of a supremacy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.985" offset="1007261">They claim that they could undercut the evils, various nuisance evils at the source by passing this type of an overbroad speech inhibiting ordinance.</text>

            <text syncTime="283.944" offset="1239124">We don't know whether New York, we know that New York has this power under the Twenty-first Amendment, we don't know whether it resides in the state liquor authority or whether it's delegated at the town of Hempstead.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.491" offset="1289383">I think you pretty well have waived that by failing to litigate that in the state courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="372.680" offset="1594075">They said, No exposure of the breast or the lower part of the torso in the town of North Hempstead in any public place, whether it'd be part of a sketch, scene, act, or entertainment or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.057" offset="1643604">So, I'm willing to deal with what they did say rather than what they didn't say and I'm not depending upon the fact that they couldn't have passed the LaRue type statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.724" offset="1690311">There is a contention by Mr. Darago made yesterday that the overbreadth adjudication is limited to the spoken word and all I need to say is that overbreadth adjudication is limited to expression protected by the First Amendment and or presumptively protected by the First Amendment or expression which could be protected by the First Amendment and that includes a great deal more than the spoken work.</text>

            <text syncTime="444.139" offset="1879960">It should be noted that there are ample laws in the State of New York to cover those evils of litter, noise, traffic congestion, and whatever unspecified conduct of patrons they maybe referring to that if there weren't adequate laws in the State of New York or the town of North Hempstead, these evils could've been cope with by a more narrowly drawn specifically directed piece of legislation rather than what is referred to as a cutting off at the source.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.211" offset="2040247">It would be just as appropriate for a town to forbid sporting events because of the traffic congestion incident to a stadium or to forbid political rallies because of the congestion incident to the area where it take place as it is to pass this type of ordinance to cope with traffic congestion or noise or litter.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.022" offset="2155499">There is no doubt of what the intention of the town of North Hempstead was.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.278" offset="2184443">What I am arguing here today under the doctrine of overbreadth is that the law which they passed was far too broad to be permitted under the First Amendment.</text>
