            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">The judgment and opinions -- judgments and opinions of the Court in two cases, 73-5772, Faretta against California, and 73-6587, Herring against New York will be announced by Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="19.762" offset="78994">The first of these cases, Faretta against the State of California is here by way of a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of California for the Second Appellate District.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.656" offset="134583">The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of our Constitution guarantee that a person brought to trial in any state or federal court must be afforded the right to the assistance of counsel before he can be validly convicted and punished by imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.326" offset="217234">The question before us in the present case is whether a defendant in a state criminal trial has a constitutional right to proceed without counsel when he voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.328" offset="285257">Stated another way, the question is whether a State may constitutionally hale a person into its criminal courts and there force a lawyer upon him, even when he insists that he wants to conduct his own defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.596" offset="354325">It is not an easy question.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.300" offset="373133">Anthony Faretta was charged with grand theft in an information filed in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.168" offset="408660">At the arraignment, the Judge assigned to preside at the trial appointed the public defender to represent Faretta.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.233" offset="444918">Well before the date of trial, however, Faretta requested that he be permitted to represent himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.760" offset="487027">In accordance with a then recent California Supreme Court decision, the judge ruled that Faretta had constitutional right to conduct his own defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.345" offset="541362">Throughout the subsequent trial, the judge required that Faretta's defense be conducted only through the appointed lawyer from the public defender's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.552" offset="586188">At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found Faretta guilty as charged, and the judge sentenced him to prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.478" offset="625894">The California Court of Appeal, affirmed the trial judge's ruling that Faretta had no federal or state constitutional right to represent himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.650" offset="670511">Accordingly, the appellate court affirmed Faretta's conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.366" offset="689424">The California Supreme Court denied review.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.860" offset="707396">And we granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.719" offset="726831">In a rather lengthy written opinion filed today, we review the previous dicta of this Court concerning the question now before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.509" offset="769985">The decisions of state courts and Federal Court of Appeals, the structure of the Sixth Amendment and the English and colonial legal history from which that Amendment emerged.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.431" offset="833724">This review leads we think inexorably to the conclusion that under our constitution, a person does have a right to conduct his own defense in a state criminal trial if he insist upon doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.223" offset="904882">It is worth noting that in the long history of British, colonial, and American criminal law, there was only one tribunal that ever adopted the practice of forcing a lawyer upon an unwilling defendant in a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.020" offset="988056">That tribunal was the Star Chamber.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.575" offset="1014282">There can be no blinking the fact that the right of an accused to conduct his own defense seems to cut against the grain of this Court's decisions holding that the constitution requires that no accused can be convicted and imprisoned unless he has been accorded the right to the assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.788" offset="1107069">For it is surely true that the basic thesis of those decisions is that the help of a lawyer is essential to assure the defendant a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.536" offset="1154090">And a strong argument can surely be made that the whole thrust of those decisions must inevitably lead to the conclusion that a State may constitutionally impose a lawyer upon even an unwilling defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.934" offset="1219709">But it is one thing to hold that every defendant, rich or poor, has the right to the assistance of counsel, and quite another to say that a State may compel a defendant to accept a lawyer he does not want.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.493" offset="1285956">The value of state-appointed counsel was not unappreciated by the Founders, yet the notion of compulsory counsel was utterly foreign to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.095" offset="1336320">And whatever else may be said of those who wrote the Bill of Rights, surely there can be no doubt that they understood the inestimable worth of free choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.286" offset="1393058">It is undeniable that in most criminal prosecutions defendants could better defend with counsel's guidance than by their own unskilled efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.092" offset="1436317">But where the defendant will not voluntarily accept representation by counsel, the potential advantage of a lawyer's training and experience can be realized, if at all, only imperfectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.957" offset="1495771">To force a lawyer on a defendant can only lead him to believe that the law contrives against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.211" offset="1528790">Moreover, it is not inconceivable that in some rare instances, the defendant might in fact present his case more effectively by conducting his own defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.002" offset="1579990">Personal liberties are not rooted in the law of averages.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.000" offset="1599948">The right to defend is personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.617" offset="1614367">The defendant, and not his lawyer or the State, will bear the personal consequences of a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.289" offset="1645087">It is the defendant, therefore, who must be free personally to decide whether in his particular case counsel is to his advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.851" offset="1687301">And although he may conduct his own defense ultimately to his own detriment, his choice must be honored out of that respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.908" offset="1751562">In this case, weeks before trial, Faretta clearly and unequivocally declared to the trial judge that he wanted to represent himself and that he did not want a lawyer to help him.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.946" offset="1811749">The record affirmatively shows that Faretta was literate, competent, and understanding and that he was voluntarily exercising his informed free will.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.103" offset="1868382">We hold that in forcing Faretta under these circumstances to accept against his will a state appointed public defender, the California courts deprived him of his constitutional right to conduct his own defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.126" offset="1936405">Accordingly, the judgment before us is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the written opinion of the Court filed with the clerk this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.792" offset="1999099">The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion which Mr. Justice Blackmun and Mr. Justice Rehnquist have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.397" offset="2029505">Mr. Justice Blackmun has also filed a dissenting opinion which the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Rehnquist have joined.</text>
