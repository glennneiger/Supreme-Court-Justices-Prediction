            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll arguments next in 73-1452, Oregon against Hass.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.622" offset="133831">Mr. Denney, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas H. Denney</label>
            <text syncTime="10.455" offset="145220">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.838" offset="154728">This case is here on the State of Oregon’s petition for certiorari to review a decision of the Oregon Supreme Court holding that statements made by a criminal defendant who has been advised of his constitutional rights in accordance with the requirements of Miranda versus Arizona and who has expressed the desire to talk to an attorney or has at least inquired about the inavailability of counsel may not be used to impeach his trial testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.126" offset="263920">From the states point of view, the holding of the Oregon Supreme Court in this case denies to Oregon prosecutors -- the right to use statements, evidence which is constitutionally admissible under this Court's holding in Harris versus New York and we therefore seek reversal of the Oregon Supreme Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.935" offset="335078">Perhaps from my broader point of view this case presents the Court with an opportunity to delineate more fully the extent of the holding in Harris and I should hope if the Court chooses to do so that some of the tangential material that it is put in the brief for the petitioner in footnotes maybe of some assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.112" offset="419819">Before I turn to the merits of the case, there are two objections to the states being here at all that are raised in the brief for respondent that I would like to deal with very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.465" offset="461197">First of this is the contention that the State of Oregon has no standing to be here because we are not aggrieved by the judgment of the Oregon Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.221" offset="496306">Well, I think it’s fairly clear that a holding of the Oregon Supreme Court that the State of Oregon may not use evidence that is constitutionally permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.110" offset="539773">Thus, make us a party aggrieved and I don't think that the right of the state to seek certiorari in such cases is open to very serious question.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.905" offset="574986">The most recent case in which the -- that I could find and which the state petition for certiorari was granted in a similar case was California versus Green in 1970 but I'm sure there have been many petitions sought in the -- sought since and certainly perhaps if you grant it and certainly I don’t think this is an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.291" offset="660564">Of a little more substance perhaps is the argument raised in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.006" offset="679372">One in the respondent's brief to the effect that the state cannot prevail in this case because the states are free to impose higher or different standards of constitutional guarantees of liberty let me say.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.402" offset="752933">Then, those enunciated in this Court's interpretation of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.549" offset="769546">Well, we don’t quite agree with the argument that is advanced as we understand the law of course, this Court is the final interpreter of any question arising under the federal constitution and the states are not free to predicate any holding contrary on grounds of the federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.317" offset="840600">We think as I've indicated in the brief for petitioner among other places I think Cooper versus California clearly implies what I have just said.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="194.234" stopTime="207.222">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="194.234" offset="880306">Is that the case in which we remanded to the -- one of the cases we remanded to the Supreme Court of California to ask them to state clearly whether they acted on the federal or the state constitution or was that another case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_h_denney" startTime="207.222" stopTime="216.846">
            <label>Mr. Thomas H. Denney</label>
            <text syncTime="207.222" offset="932237">I believe that was what was done in that case Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.354" offset="944776">I'm not positive, I think Ker versus California was another such case and this is one that is cited in the respondent’s brief.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="216.846" offset="970794">You don’t challenge the right of the Supreme Court of Oregon interpreting its own search and seizure constitutional provisions to come to a different conclusion in this Court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_h_denney" startTime="225.767" stopTime="334.697">
            <label>Mr. Thomas H. Denney</label>
            <text syncTime="225.767" offset="1006425">Oh! Certainly not Mr. Justice Rehnquist but my point incidentally this is not the search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.506" offset="1025442">This is a confession question of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.161" offset="1039966">But our point is that this case is just clearly not beside it on state constitutional grounds and I think I've indicated that in the reply brief to expand a little more fully on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.552" offset="1077582">The state constitution was not invoked in connection with this assignment of error by either side below.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.072" offset="1107675">The state constitution is not even mentioned in the opinion of the Oregon Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.593" offset="1129723">The Court's opinion instead distinguishes this case from Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.039" offset="1151561">In addition, the case is on which the Oregon Supreme Court relied the Oregon cases of State versus Brewton and State versus Neely are themselves not predicated on the Oregon Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.941" offset="1199104">The Constitution isn’t -- the state constitution isn’t even mentioned in State versus Brewton.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.045" offset="1223555">It is mentioned in State versus Neely but only to say that we are not predicating our holding on the Oregon State Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.735" offset="1258350">Now, it was I cannot say that the state constitution did not come up at all in this case because during the oral argument in this case before the Supreme Court of Oregon the Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court asked if the state were not -- if the Supreme Court were not free to predicate its holding on the Oregon Constitution and reached a different result from whatever this Court might reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.702" offset="1358137">We agreed that they have that power but the discussion ended there.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.822" offset="1378617">So, we submit that this case just simply is not a case predicated on state constitutional grounds and I don't think that there is anything in the record of this case which would support what might otherwise argue for a remand of this case for clarification.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="334.697" offset="1442147">I gather Oregon does have a counterpart of the self-incrimination clause?</text>

          <turn speaker="thomas_h_denney" startTime="337.886" stopTime="351.930">
            <label>Mr. Thomas H. Denney</label>
            <text syncTime="337.886" offset="1454895">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.673" offset="1458030">I believe its set forth in the respondent's brief as Article 1, Section 12 -- no person shall be put in jeopardy twice for the same offense nor be compelled in any criminal prosecution to testify against himself.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="351.930" stopTime="356.850">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="351.930" offset="1511111">So, had they rested this decision on that provision you would not be here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_h_denney" startTime="356.850" stopTime="886.008">
            <label>Mr. Thomas H. Denney</label>
            <text syncTime="356.850" offset="1530755">Absolutely not but my point is they didn't and that is why we contend we have every right to be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.964" offset="1563251">Now, turning to the facts of this case; the facts are simple relatively undisputed and it would be a trivial case if it were not for the fact that the Harris issue is clearly presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.279" offset="1620511">Basically, it involves the theft of a bicycle out of the garage of a resident in Klamath Falls, Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.755" offset="1646425">The owner of the bicycle and his father saw the thief who was we think it clear now defendant's accomplice drive the bicycle or ride the bicycle out of the driveway.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.359" offset="1688848">They gave a chase.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.643" offset="1693968">They ultimately intercepted the defendant’s Volkswagen bus.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.143" offset="1711940">The defendant was driving at the bicycle was in the back.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.078" offset="1723643">The father and son recovered the bicycle and called the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.290" offset="1740570">In response to that call, a state police officer traced the Volkswagen bus and went to the defendant’s home.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.191" offset="1776097">He advised him of his Miranda Rights and his advice incidentally included a specific warning that the defendant could stop talking at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.002" offset="1815385">In addition to the usual fourfold right to remain silent etcetera has admitted that he had taken two bicycles that day and he wasn’t sure which one the officer was talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.668" offset="1866062">Upon further conversation, he said that he had given one bicycle back which I gather his interpretation of the incident with the father and son demanding it back and that he had concealed the other and he agreed to show the officer where he had concealed the second bicycle.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.689" offset="1946102">On the way to the spot where the second bicycle was concealed however has with already admitted his guilt in the offense to this extent indicated and the exact wording he used is a little bit in dispute the two versions are set forth in the petitioner’s brief indicated that he would like to consult with an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.644" offset="2021961">The officer said that he couldn't make counsel available to him right then.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.788" offset="2042546">However, he would make counsel available or at least a phone would be provided to him as soon as they got to the state police headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.527" offset="2081520">According to the officer in response to a specific question from Hass he then said that he was not going to force Hass to continue with the investigation but he would like to clear the matter off.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.398" offset="2128959">Now, Hass' version of the events as that the officer said, “I can't let you see a lawyer but I'll let you when we get down to the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.046" offset="2159574">And even Hass' version of the events does not claim that there was any greater degree of coercion or pressure put upon him than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.924" offset="2199071">In any event, they went to the spot where the second bicycle was recovered and it turned out to have been taken from another residence in the same general area at approximately the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.294" offset="2244524">There was no evidence in the record indicating specifically that the bicycle had been taken the same day except for the defendant's later testimony to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.125" offset="2287888">There was an in camera hearing to determine whether or not ought the police officer's testimony would be admissible with respect to everything that the defendant has it said and done at the time of this interrogation or this questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.973" offset="2359254">After hearing, the testimony the trial court ruled that everything has did and said and in fact defense counsel conceded this that everything has did and said up to the time he inquired about the availability of counsel would be clearly admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.888" offset="2418918">But that this inquiry brought Miranda into play and that nothing else would be admissible in the states case in chief and nothing else was admitted in states case in chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.241" offset="2464371">Has then took to stand and testified that he and two other fellows have been driving around the general area where the bicycles were taken that the other two person had taken the bicycles without his prior knowledge and that he didn't know exactly where they came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.117" offset="2535842">This was all they did on the direct examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.211" offset="2552247">In short, he admits his part in the theft of the bicycles in the sense of receiving and concealing the stolen property.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.359" offset="2580773">He conceded that he figured they were stolen from the way his two friends brought them to him but he claimed that he had no prior knowledge of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.609" offset="2609821">And that he therefore wasn’t guilty of the burglary with which he was charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.050" offset="2627584">And this is particularly significant in Oregon or it was particularly significant still is actually because Oregon some months before the trial in this case have adopted a same transaction test of determining when jeopardy attaches and it is very probable under the teachings of that particular case which was State versus Brown and again cited in the brief that had the jury believe passes testimony and acquitted him of the burglary charge double jeopardy as interpreted by the Supreme Court of Oregon construing the Oregon Constitution would have barred a second trial for the theft at which he then admitted his guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.426" offset="2785050">Well, in rebuttal to Hass' testimony after the case of Harris versus New York was called of the trial court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.367" offset="2812844">The state recalled the state police officer who testified that after he had obtained the admissions from Hass that he had previously testified to, Hass had taken him around to the residential area where the bicycles were taken and that Hass had pointed out the precise locations of the two houses from which those bicycles had been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.347" offset="2900720">The Court then instructed the jury that this testimony was to be received only for impeachment purposes and then on surrebuttal has went ahead to deny that he had pointed out the houses in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.424" offset="2953070">There's very little I can say about this case because basically when we get to the legal issues presented because it seems to me that it comes so clearly within the parameters of Harris that it's almost pointless to draw the distinctions that Oregon Supreme Court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.924" offset="3039065">In the first place here as before, we have as in Harris we have the defendant affirmatively stating on the direct examination testimony that he know -- when he knows that the state is not going to be able to present contrary testimony at least in this case in chief and wasn't able to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.846" offset="3118791">They knew that this testimony existed and they knew that they have been ruled and admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.091" offset="3135718">It seems that this presents in this kind of context I'm not necessarily saying that it happened here that we have a marvelous opportunity for criminal defendants to tailor their testimony in accordance to account for anything they may have said prior to the time they may have asked for counsel under the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.090" offset="3219728">There is no contention as I have mentioned before that anything Hass' statements or what he did was in fact coerced or involuntary or that any pressure was put on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.713" offset="3262255">He have been advised of this Miranda Rights, he have been told he could stop answering questions at any time, he asked for a lawyer -- the lawyer he was told that counsel would be made available to him when he got the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.526" offset="3313455">And that's it he doesn't claim that there was any coercion at all put upon him to continue beyond the mere request of the officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.847" offset="3346787">This we submit is enough to satisfy the primer and the standards of voluntariness and trustworthiness which would render the statements he made and the things he did after he inquired about the availability of counsel admissible at least for impeachment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.739" offset="3422333">As I've noted in a footnote it seems to be an open question yet at least this Court hasn't directly spoken on the issue of whether advise of rights which tells an accuse that counsel will be made available to him at a later time such as when and if you go to court was one example makes the statements inadmissible in the case in chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.720" offset="3498297">We're not contesting this because the argument wasn't raised below and I don't feel that I'm entitled to make the contention here that the statements has that were admissible in the case in chief nor do I need to.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.407" offset="3548975">But it certainly seems to me that this kind of statement should be made and should be admissible for impeachment purposes under the facts of this case particularly where as again here the jury was carefully instructed that the statements were limited to impeachment and were not to be considered in determining the guilt or innocence of Hass per se.</text>

            <text syncTime="2377.154" offset="9611995">The restriction against police for purposely and knowingly violating a person's constitutional rights in face of the knowledge of this Court's requirements is a difference set of facts than an intent to know failure to say words that are necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2801.426" offset="11309119">On the contrary, because Harris is a ruling that is favorable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.315" offset="11324583">I suppose the argument can be made either way but the fact is that the Harris decision cuts against the Oregon Supreme Court’s decision in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2826.220" offset="11408280">Turning to the merits of the issue just briefly, there was one other point that came up in counsel’s argument for the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.929" offset="11443075">The Harris case does not pause to consider whether the states or whether the police officer’s failure to advise the man in toto of his constitutional rights was inadvertent or whether it was unintentional or whether it was intentional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.063" offset="11499604">Similarly, we think that the kind of questioning that goes on here or the asking the defendant to continue the investigation even if this could be construed as an intentional violation of constitutional rights and on the facts of this case we don’t think it rises at that level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.347" offset="11580792">We still think that the policy enunciated in Harris is applicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.687" offset="11602108">Simply because in either situation as the Court held the prophylactic purpose of Miranda is sufficiently served by keeping the statement subsequently obtained out of the case in chief; but keeping it available to prevent perjury a possible out note perjury when the defendant takes to stand and keeping it available for impeachment purposes.</text>
