            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">In the second case which is 74-634, U.S. against Nobles, we have a case that came to us on certiorari from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.905" offset="63530">An investigator for a defendant in a criminal case obtained prior to trial a statement from a prosecution witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.501" offset="101982">The witness was cross-examined by defense counsel on a subject matter of this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.063" offset="128209">Thereafter and for impeachment purposes, the defense called in the investigator to testify as to his interview with the prosecution witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.051" offset="172199">Defense counsel advised the Court, however, that he would not produce the written statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.079" offset="196232">The Court of Appeals reversing the District Court held that both the Fifth Amendment and Federal Criminal Procedure Rule 16 protected the statement from compelled disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.344" offset="253283">We take a different view.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.540" offset="262060">The Fifth Amendment privilege being personal to the defendant does not extend to the statement of a third-party witness nor does Rule 16 authorize a different result as it relates only to pretrial discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.673" offset="334681">Defendant also asserted a work product privilege, but even if that privilege would have been available it was waived by defendant when he elected to make testimonial use of the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.358" offset="393404">Accordingly, we -- we reverse the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.386" offset="409496">Mr. Justice White joined by Mr. Justice Rehnquist filed a concurring opinion in which he agreed with the judgment and joined in Parts, II, III and V of the Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.840" offset="471353">Mr. Justice Douglas took no part in the decision of this case.</text>
