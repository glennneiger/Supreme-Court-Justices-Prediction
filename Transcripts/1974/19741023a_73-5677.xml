            <text syncTime="137.832" offset="655736">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.170" offset="669111">The ultimate question in this case is a very narrow one.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.628" offset="682904">It is whether the petitioner can ever be considered for parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.748" offset="699413">The relief we seek is not his release from prison, only that he'll be given the opportunity to come before the parole court.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.739" offset="731387">The facts in this case were simple and undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.036" offset="744552">Maurice Schick, a man of some 52 years of age, has been incarcerated just under 21 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.640" offset="770988">The terms of his present sentence require that he remain in prison for the rest of his life but no possibility of parole release.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.376" offset="801917">In March 1954, he was tried by an army general court-martial convened just outside Tokyo, Japan for the murder of the daughter of an army colonel assigned to that post.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.900" offset="851968">Following a six-day trial at which the sole disputed issue was the legal sanity of the accused at the time of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.692" offset="883210">Petitioner was convicted and sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.069" offset="896690">Although, at various times during the course of the trial and appellate proceedings, eight prominent civilian psychiatrists concluded that he lacked direct the requisite mental responsibility at the time of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.273" offset="945486">His conviction and sentence were nonetheless approved by all military appellate reviewing authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.021" offset="968474">And in 1957, his case was forwarded as it's required by statute to the President for his review.</text>

            <text syncTime="227.637" offset="1014972">That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>

            <label>Mr. Homer E. Moyer, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="237.721" offset="1055305">At the time of trial, there were two civilian Japanese psychiatrists.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.685" offset="1071188">He did not have the opportunity to return to the United States during the course of the appellate proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.830" offset="1095743">Opinions were submitted by Dr. Karl Menninger, three other psychiatrists from the Menninger Clinic, the psychiatrist to Saint Elizabeth's, the psychiatrist for the Baltimore court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.041" offset="1136598">All of the civilian psychiatrists prepond that he lack the requisite mental responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.905" offset="1160004">In 1960, the President commuted petitioner sentence to life imprisonment unconditioned that he never be considered for parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.517" offset="1190515">At issue here is the validity of that "no-parole provision."</text>
            <text syncTime="275.992" offset="1208383">We maintain that it is constitutionally invalid on two separate and independently dispositive grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.657" offset="1238998">First, it is invalid under the retrospective application of Furman against Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.423" offset="1258120">And second, it is invalid because in imposing a commuted punishment of life imprisonment with no possibility of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.247" offset="1285392">The President exceeded his constitutional ground of authority under Article II, Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.176" offset="1309111">I should like first to discuss the Furman point which is the narrower ground for decision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.939" offset="1336174">Petitioner and respondents agree on a number of factors that bear on the Furman point.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.240" offset="1357385">There's first of all the no disagreement, that the sentence of life imprisonment with no possibility of parole could not have been a judge to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.718" offset="1387269">The only sentencing options for the court-martial were death or life imprisonment without or with the usual parole possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.060" offset="1416631">Second, there is no disagreement about the inextricable relationship between the death penalty and petitioner's present, "no-parole life sentence."</text>
            <text syncTime="336.780" offset="1451530">Petitioner could never have become subject to its present sentence, had he not first been sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.701" offset="1479220">Third, there is no disagreement that Furman against Georgia invalidated the imposition and as well as the carrying out of the dearth penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.712" offset="1511194">Lower courts implementing Furman have vacated death sentence isn't substituted alternative punishments provided by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.663" offset="1539093">And finally, there is no disagreement here that Furman against Georgia has been applied retrospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.434" offset="1562081">Given this undisputed facts, the "no-parole provision" of petitioner sentence is necessarily invalid for it could not now exist but for the prior imposition of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.971" offset="1612236">Had the death penalty never been imposed petitioner would now be eligible for parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.822" offset="1635641">Moreover, if the Court were to uphold the petitioner's present sentence, it would sanction the following situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.504" offset="1662391">All prisoners sentenced to death but not executed at the time of Furman now are serving sentences of life imprisonment with eligibility of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.799" offset="1699589">All, except the petitioner and one other prisoner whose situation is identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.462" offset="1722264">Schick, who is singled out for executive clemency, is now serving a more severe sentence than prisoners who have been sentenced to death but not executed and not singled out for executive clemency.</text>

            <text syncTime="422.999" offset="1796347">Presumably he could petition regularly for additional executive clemency.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.519" offset="1822469">A petition was submitted, Mr. Justice Blackmun, in 1968 and denied in early 1969.</text>

            <text syncTime="460.738" offset="1947335">You know that the death penalty is cruel and unusual in the military situations?</text>

            <label>Mr. Homer E. Moyer, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="465.540" offset="1966561">Well, the Government has raised that point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.548" offset="1982548">The answer to that is we submit clearly that it is constitutionally cruel and unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.987" offset="2008357">I shall address that in some detail momentarily.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="479.373" stopTime="497.115">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="479.373" offset="2021940">Now that I've interrupted you, as I looked at your brief and your reply brief, I think you didn't cite Warden against Marrero of last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.951" offset="2060184">Thus the Government has relied upon somewhere in your argument, would you touch upon that and let us have the benefit of your comments, when do you get to it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="homer_e_moyer_jr" startTime="497.115" stopTime="960.946">
            <label>Mr. Homer E. Moyer, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="497.115" offset="2092889">Warden against Marrero involved primarily, Mr. Justice Blackmun, a statutory question about parole applicability for the petitioner there and the effect of a 1970 statute dealing exclusively with drug traffickers and whether someone who was ineligible for parole under prior statute was -- should be considered eligible for parole subsequent to the 1970 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.097" offset="2212739">The question we present here or that is involved here is not under our Furman point of statutory question.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.150" offset="2240951">Our point here is that retrospective application of the constitutional rule of Furman must necessarily invalidate the "no-parole provision."</text>
            <text syncTime="544.437" offset="2282120">There was in this case, no statutory basis for the "no-parole provision" and that point, I shall elaborate on.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.163" offset="2325065">The result in this case that the petitioner is serving the most severe sentence of anyone in the Federal Prison System, because he was a subject of executive clemency is simply a pervasive result.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.494" offset="2386401">The result -- this result is clearly contrary to the purpose and the spirit of executive clemency and we submit under Furman against Georgia cannot be permitted to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.530" offset="2426525">And then asking the Court to invalidate this provision, we're asking simply that it rule exactly the same way as the Supreme Court of California en banc ruled when it was faced with precisely the same issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.453" offset="2478247">That case is In re Walker and is discussed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.379" offset="2497891">In responding to the Furman point, the Government has abandoned some arguments that are earlier advanced including I might note the argument that the majority of the Court of Appeals below adopted its rationale of decision, namely that death sentence was never imposed in petitioner's case because it had never been ordered executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.949" offset="2584200">Now, the Government's primary defense to the Furman point appears to rest on the contention raised for the first time and its brief under merits that Furman against Georgia does not apply to the military at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.420" offset="2634041">This contention on the factual assertions that rest upon are wholly unsupportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.927" offset="2664135">On our reply brief, we have cited extensive authority which contradicts this new argument and I shall not repeat that case law here.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.039" offset="2700601">Let me say only in summary that that proposition is directly contradicted by opinions of members of this Court in Furman against Georgia itself which expressly contemplate applicability to the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.130" offset="2756921">It is also inconsistent with precedents of military courts and civilian courts including this Court applying the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishments to the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.195" offset="2805196">But it must be emphasized that the proposition that the Government puts forward here is fundamentally inconsistent with the entire pattern of development of military law since the enactment of the Uniform Code of Military Justice in 1950 because that pattern of growth which has been shaped by civilian court opinions, military court opinions, and by congressional enactments has consistently minimized the differences between military and civilian criminal procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.323" offset="2929643">Now, the Government offers two factual justifications, why Furman should not apply to the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.055" offset="2956601">It should first be observed that whether or not these are true, these assertions would not serve to override contrary Bank of Preston cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.061" offset="2996621">Moreover, by seeking a factual evaluation, the Government asks this Court to open the door to jurisdiction by jurisdiction review of the applicability of the Furman rationale to the particular experience of a given jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.168" offset="3061091">But most important, the factual assertions that the Government seeks to rest its argument on are demonstrably false.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.278" offset="3093483">The Government argues first that military discipline and special military circumstances require the use of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.871" offset="3131831">Restated this argument is that military discipline is dependent upon capital punishment or more precisely dependent up on constitutionally cruel and unusual punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.775" offset="3179478">This is simply the baseless.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.592" offset="3186792">The short answer is provided by the military itself or the death penalty and the military has fallen into destitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.207" offset="3221274">It is simply not used.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.963" offset="3228275">When it has been used by the military, it has been used not to further disciplinary purposes but the punish servicemen for committing civilian type offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.641" offset="3266936">The fact that the United States Marine Corps has gone for more than a century and a quarter without so much as it judging the death penalty at trial is itself conclusive evidence that the Government's claim is simply unsupportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.258" offset="3337467">The Government also argues that the military appellate structure assures that the use of the death penalty in the military will not be random or discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.908" offset="3384069">This is first of all precisely the type of argument that this Court refused to hear in the petitions for rehearing submitted by the States of Pennsylvania and Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.881" offset="3427955">Secondly, this is demonstrably untrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.356" offset="3445823">We address this point at some length in our brief and I shall not repeat that.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.243" offset="3465362">Let me say only, that we know that the use of the death penalty in the military is random in the extremes.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.283" offset="3493575">We know that it is used so and frequently that it cannot possibly serve any legislative or social purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.441" offset="3518130">We know that it is discriminatory among the services for it's confined almost exclusively to the Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.556" offset="3542580">We know that this impact is racially discriminatory of the eight servicemen executed since 1950, whose race we know, all were black.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.648" offset="3583018">And furthermore, we know rather dramatically that in the military, the use of the death penalty does not necessarily correlate with the severity of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.577" offset="3622724">By no stretch of the imagination can it be asserted with the use of the death penalty in the military is less discriminatory or less random or less irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.759" offset="3663475">There is in short no basis whatever for the factual assertions.</text>

            <text syncTime="948.792" offset="3899517">But it is also undisputed that there are some limits to that constitutional power.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.645" offset="3923028">There are admittedly some lesser punishments that the President cannot substitute in the act of commutation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1124.972" offset="4604301">And in the hypothetical you posit, a second reading of the legislative basis rule in Wells might will be that legislative basis exists where the commuted punishment is one of common usage found throughout the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.997" offset="4672428">And in that case, confinement certainly is the most common punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.857" offset="4695834">And under the hypothetical you posit, the President certainly would be able to commute in that situation and we do not contend otherwise in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.728" offset="4739302">This rule obviously flows from the basic separation of powers that the defining of criminal punishments is a uniquely legislative option, that a ruling by this Court to the President need not look to legislatively sanctioned punishments, would confer up on the President, the authority to device punishments that he sees fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.094" offset="4832820">Now, the Government appears not to take serious issue with the general proposition that there must be some legislative basis of commuted punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.941" offset="4876184">Indeed, the Solicitor General in Biddle against Perovich argued that very point rather the area of primary dispute here, this whether there exists the requisite legislative basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.770" offset="4923517">We maintain that no such basis here exists for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.706" offset="4951207">First, the commuted punishment of life imprisonment with no possibility of parole is a punishment completely foreign under military law and foreign to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.983" offset="4992376">Not only as it's not a punishment for the offense of which petitioner was convicted but it is provided nowhere in the UCMJ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.894" offset="5023932">If death sentence were imposed at a military trial, it would simply be an illegal sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.552" offset="5046606">Moreover, that punishment was nowhere to be found among the civilian federal criminal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.406" offset="5070012">When the President in Schick's case commuted his punishment, he could point to no statute that authorized the punishment of life imprisonment with no possibility of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.436" offset="5114107">Thus, in Schick's case the President not only substituted the commuted punishment but he devised it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.616" offset="5146812">And so doing, we maintain that he exercised a uniquely legislative function, a function reserved by the Constitution to the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.253" offset="5197385">So, in final response to your question, Mr. Justice Blackmun, under any reading of the rule suggested in the earlier cases Wells and Perovich by this case, the President's action here would not be sustainable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.057" offset="5256631">Indeed, when one looks at the legislative scheme not only is there no authorization for the lesser punishment to which petitioner sentence was commuted but the legislative scheme reflects a direct con -- directly contrary policy for the parole statute which has been a part of federal law since 1910.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.688" offset="5343148">It reflects a congressional commitment to offender rehabilitation as a matter of federal correctional policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1553.144" offset="6316993">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.877" offset="6327860">I should like to begin with the last point touched upon by my opponent which is to say, the propriety of the no-parole condition which is attached by the President when he commuted such in Schick's death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.400" offset="6390032">As Mr. Justice Blackmun, I think has narrowed the point, my opponent is not clear whether he is saying that one must look to the penalties or punishments provided by the murder statute in your Article 118 of the Code on whether one simply looks to the federal criminal law or the criminal law as a whole to determine the issue which he puts which is can the President invent a new novel penalty punishment alien to American Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.803" offset="6535586">For the purpose of this case, we may assume, though the Court has never so held and it's arguable that only other constitutional limitations applies such as cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.593" offset="6582815">We may assume that the President enjoys no power to create a totally novel or bizarre penalty which is elsewhere unknown in the criminal laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.038" offset="6640598">But that is simply not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.913" offset="6656063">To be sure, Article 118, the murder statute in the military case provides only two alternatives, death or life imprisonment with normally, eligibility for parole, but other laws in the Untied States including a specific federal statute, do envisage life imprisonment without a parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.274" offset="6745506">So we're not in the area of a novel invention, the creation of a new penalty which arguably might present a difficult constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.839" offset="6783749">We're dealing with a condition which is only recently affirmed by Congress as a proper punishment in the federal system as Mr. Justice Blackmun has pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.070" offset="6844667">We're also dealing with the provision which is common in the laws of 20 States and many times for murder, often for all life sentences, the eligibility for parole which is otherwise available is denied in the case of life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.411" offset="6914048">Nothing therefore extraordinary in this provision and therefore, nothing beyond the power of the President unless he is confined to the same alternatives the judge would be, and of course he is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.541" offset="6966606">One need take only the example of a judge who sentences to the statutory minimum, the result would be that the President cannot exercise his power of mercy --</text>

            <text syncTime="1866.792" offset="7571602">Military death sentences during President Eisenhower's period in office would at a guess and it's really a guess because the figures are divided in ways that don't show it too clearly of something in the order of 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.845" offset="7671808">Now, let me say finally on this point that there is no statutory bar even assuming that a statutory bar to this sort of condition attached to a presidential pardon were constitutionally relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.878" offset="7735860">The very statute involved here under the Uniform Military Code specifically authorizes the President to commute a sentence to such lesser punishment as he sees fit leaving him a full sway, full of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.179" offset="7801062">The general parole statute as we indicate in our brief initially had a provision which specifically says this is in no way meant to control or fetter the discretion of the President when exercising its constitutional power of pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.498" offset="7878384">Now, let me say that the relevance of this issue is important if the Court should hold that the mandatory death sentence passes constitutional muster because in that event it will indeed be important to recognize in the President a power to commute or in governors of states the power to commute any mandatory death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.215" offset="7989248">But in at least the most shocking cases, once cannot expect that a power of clemency to be exercised if the alternative use here is unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.471" offset="8046299">And yet the result would be if the alternative were available to encourage the commutation of death sentences when the chief executive, whether the United States Service is in a position to assure that there will be no automatic eligibility for parole in 15 years, which does not deprive him of a later opportunity or of his successor of an opportunity to reconsider the matter at a later time nor indeed does it in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.780" offset="8191540">Now, leaving that question and turning to Furman versus Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.709" offset="8215259">It is said that Furman versus Georgia has been held by this Court to be fully retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.047" offset="8244621">And it is true that in two cases in Michigan versus Payne and in Robinson versus Neil, this Court so characterized its prior holdings with respect to Furman and Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.835" offset="8311704">I don't want to quibble that terminology but it is at least arguable that all the Court has ever held with respect to Furman is that it will prevent the present execution of any death sentence no matter when imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.864" offset="8383801">The Court has not had occasion to hold and has not held that Furman versus Georgia is fully retroactive in the same sense as it's held Gideon versus Wainwright fully retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.078" offset="8436673">For instance, I don't suppose the Court has had before it but I'm not sure that the Court has foreclosed itself from ruling if a criminal at the prison now should come before the Court and say, "I plead guilty out of fear of a death penalty which this Court has now ruled was unconstitutional and therefore, I want to withdraw my plea and have a trial."</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.401" offset="8541999">That would be fully retroactive application of Furman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.187" offset="8565196">If the Court were to force such a prisoner a reopening of his conviction on a plea of guilty and it's not an unreal hypothesis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.747" offset="8607410">There may indeed also be civil consequences that flow from a full retroactive application of Furman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.645" offset="8642936">(audio abruptly cut 00:35:34-00:35:40)I'm not sure what they would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.455" offset="8650250">Well, they deal with life insurance policies or other matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.929" offset="8668118">But this Court hasn't left that question open.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.317" offset="8685672">Now, let's say that the Court has not closed the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.907" offset="8696017">Of course, this is not to indicate how you don't want to decide it now that the question may be presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.111" offset="8736872">We analyze it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.710" offset="8747217">We say the basis of the decision in Furman, when one puts together the opinions of the members of the Court who constituted majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.166" offset="8793088">It seemed to turn on two findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.756" offset="8807403">The first is that the public attitudes of today with strong emphasis on the very recent past indicate a rejection of the death penalty as unnecessarily cruel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.729" offset="8891308">Also, the experience of the recent past in the civilian context in the United States, indicates that the administration of a death penalty has been so random, so freakish, so discriminatory, so haphazard that it is unusual and cruel to impose it or carry it out today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.714" offset="9003217">To effectuate those policies, it is not necessarily required to go back 20 years to invalidate a death sentence which has already been commuted 14 years ago and to look to the collateral consequences of the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.027" offset="9100497">It seems to us that the approach followed in Michigan versus Payne is appropriate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.074" offset="9128709">And it's true that in Michigan versus Payne, the Court declined to make any retrospective application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.903" offset="9164027">Eventhough, all that was at stake was sentenced just as here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.835" offset="9183775">Now here the Court has gone somewhat further, it has said, "We will require resentencing whether it's still a realistic alternative."</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.832" offset="9231736">But it need not necessarily go over further step of undoing the commutation which was premised on a death sentence which was imposed at a time when this Court might not have found imposition freakish or contrary to prevalent attitudes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.639" offset="9318985">Now finally, we get to the question of whether at all events, Furman should be applied in military context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.852" offset="9363811">I owe the Court an apology for raising this issue so late in the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.019" offset="9384500">Part of the explanation is that in the District Court, Furman had not yet been decided when the case is in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.714" offset="9411250">This Court had not yet decided Furman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.656" offset="9427028">In the briefs in the Court of Appeal, my friend invoked Furman only by analogy, that is to suggest that the no-parole condition for the reasons given by majority in Furman violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.284" offset="9513545">An argument no longer pressed here nor indeed put by the petition of certiorari only if the oral argument in the Court of Appeal was it suggested that Furman had any direct application to this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2380.733" offset="9627335">Now, even so we should raise the point in our brief in our position in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.126" offset="9652935">We were slow in seeing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.876" offset="9667877">It is, however, it seems to us an important point if they ought not be decided backhandedly in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.265" offset="9713434">My opponent spends a very great deal of time in his reply brief proving that the cruel and unusual punishment concept applies to the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.827" offset="9751677">Without quibbling, this Court has indeed never held that the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Constitution applies to military, there are four votes for that proposition in Travis versus Dallas and only one Court of Appeal has directly so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.748" offset="9819387">But for the purpose of this case, we may assume that Article 55 of the code enacts the same standard for the military and I'm willing to treat it under that same extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.614" offset="9878841">But it does not follow that what is cruel and unusual in this civilian context is ipso facto cruel and unusual in the military system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.716" offset="9927220">Cruelty is relative, war is cruel and the reasons underlying this Court's decision in Furman for finding the death penalty cruel and unusual mainly not be applicable in the military context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.535" offset="10006528">There may be a special need for deterrent in military conditions and there, it may be more important to look to the imposition of the death sentence in the area on the battlefield which may have a very real deterrent whatever happens on review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.232" offset="10105375">On the other hand, the freakish and haphazard imposition of the death penalty which persuaded this Court to hold such discretionary penalties unconstitutional in civilian context is not so likely in the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.358" offset="10177787">If only because there are so many levels of review of sentence, something unknown to the civil system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.261" offset="10213418">First of all, the convening authority must make a decision when referring a case whether to refer it as a capital case or not, a first screen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.366" offset="10249885">If the court-martial having had the case referred to it as capital sentences the prisoner to the death penalty, it must be approved by the convening authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.384" offset="10305891">After that the case goes to the Court of Military Review which has a gained power to reduce so vary -- to commute the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.772" offset="10347478">Then, the case goes to the Court of Military Appeals which has no power to vary the sentence but reviews to conviction in line of death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.770" offset="10387498">But finally, in every death sentence case at a single level, the level of the President, we have a review of the death sentences imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.537" offset="10426577">So, it's reasonable to suppose that with a centralized system and these levels of review, we're going to come out with a patent that is less freakish to use Mr. Justice Stewart's terminology than we find in so many disparate jurisdictions all over the country and indeed in the federal civilian system.</text>

            <text syncTime="2726.201" offset="11009212">Then, you have to decide whether it applies to the military at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.063" offset="11028647">In that event, we think the record far too bear the facts, figures or other indications as to the deterrent value, as to the actual experience are not explored in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.856" offset="11091864">And the Court ought had more to go on before reaching that very important step.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.357" offset="11113806">Accordingly, should the Court go so far in the case within the appropriate cause would have to be a remand to the District Court with an opportunity for presentation of evidence and of statistics which would furnish that Court, the Court of Appeal and have ultimately this Court with a concrete record on which to make that important decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2883.653" offset="11638972">Mr. Chief Justice I have only two brief points in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.621" offset="11658930">The first is, that in asking this Court to hold that the retroactivity of Furman does not reach petitioner's sentence, the Government is asking this Court to create a new strand to the doctrine of retroactivity, a strand that would hold that some retroactive constitutional rulings are retroactive for some purposes but not for others.</text>

            <text syncTime="2912.575" offset="11754747">Well, but your proposition is based on the assumption that we've decided this issue in broad enough scope to embrace military?</text>

            <label>Mr. Homer E. Moyer, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2929.219" offset="11821307">That's right and that's the second point that I would like to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.088" offset="11836771">Respondent suggest the appropriateness of a remand in an evidentiary hearing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.704" offset="11859237">We would suggest that that is uniquely inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.416" offset="11874074">First, whatever facts might be adduced at an evidentiary hearing, they would not suffice to overturn the contrary precedents in military and civilian courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.090" offset="11916706">But moreover, we know from the facts before this Court now, that there are no facts that could be adduced that would justify the position or the propositions that the Government puts forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.080" offset="11976683">Let me deal quite briefly in the specifics of the use of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.855" offset="12007821">First, the idea that the death penalty is a deterrent must necessarily rest upon the reasonable expectation that that penalty will be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.038" offset="12052543">In the military, there is no basis for that form of expectation and certainly not in the case where military discipline is at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.852" offset="12095801">There were a 102 servicemen executed during World War II, 101 of those 102 were convicted of civilian type offenses, rape and murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.336" offset="12137702">Only one was executed for having committed a military type offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.635" offset="12162988">All 12 of the servicemen executed since 1950 committed civilian type offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.997" offset="12188379">But even if you accept the Government's hypothesis, that there is some deterrent value to the imposition of the death penalty without it as ever being executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.158" offset="12229026">We know that doesn't sustain their position here because the marine corps is not even adjudged the death sentence before -- since before 1849.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.906" offset="12268001">The navy has adjudged it five times in that century and a quarter.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="3044.906" offset="12283988">Well, I suppose it would be arguable that that demonstrates equally or perhaps no more than that the discipline in the marine corps is much better and that the quality and caliber of the people is higher as they traditionally claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="3063.593" offset="12358802">I suppose, Mr. Chief Justice in the same way, it could be argued that the more random and the more freakish the imposition of the death penalty is, the more that shows that the deterrent effect is created by the death penalty.</text>
