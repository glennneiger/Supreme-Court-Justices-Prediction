            <text syncTime="39.000" offset="259323">This is an appeal from the judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin in which that Court declared Section 448.18 (7) of the Wisconsin statutes unconstitutional and preliminarily enjoined all utilization of that subsection of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.528" offset="353468">This preliminary injunctive relief was granted in an action brought in the District Court under the Civil Rights Act by the appellee whose name is Dr. Larkin against the appellants who are the members of the Wisconsin Medical Examining Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.760" offset="438418">There are three questions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.864" offset="450853">The first question is whether a District Court in granting a mere motion for a preliminary injunction can declare a state statute unconstitutional and preliminarily enjoin all utilization of that statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="127.889" offset="614902">Over six months after this appeal was taken and jurisdiction was noted and the briefs were submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.133" offset="651891">There was a modification of the judgment and so we also have that situation presently existing, in which the Court instead of saying as an orally declared and as included in its decision and judgment that the statute was unconstitutional, it now in the modified judgment said there is a likelihood of success and it also without any evidence to support this modified the judgment to assert that there is irreparable harm.</text>

            <text syncTime="194.678" offset="882082">It doesn't declare anything unconstitutional but just enjoins the applications of these statutes against the plaintiff Duane Larkin M.D. on the grounds that he would suffer irreparable injury, if the statute were to be applied against him and that the plaintiff's challenged to the constitutionally of said statute has a high likelihood of success.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.941" offset="963166">You don't -- we don't have -- we wouldn't have direct appellate jurisdiction of any such order as that, would we?</text>

            <text syncTime="239.775" offset="1062431">Namely, that there's a violation of Due Process by the per se possession of investigative and adjudicative powers by an administrate agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.555" offset="1577566">And this of course is the real question on the merits here and that is whether the per se by itself possession and exercised by an administrative agency uphold statutory powers to investigate and statutory powers to adjudicate is a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="429.911" offset="1823013">There is also a third question here which I think is a very important one and that is whether under the circumstances of this case, the District Court had any discretion, any power to grant a motion for a preliminary injunction and if it had any discretion whether it abused that discretion in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="527.889" offset="2214954">There was no evidence at any of these in any shape or form.</text>

            <text syncTime="542.605" offset="2273782">He applied to the appellant's, the Wisconsin Medical Examining Board for a license to practice medicine in the state of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.635" offset="2313906">He was granted that license in August 1971 on the basis of the reciprocity provisions between the Wisconsin and Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.396" offset="2365001">The Medical Examining Board is a state administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.798" offset="2382555">It's the agency which issues license to practice medicine and surgery.</text>

            <text syncTime="618.161" offset="2575966">Now, this is one of the unique situations in which a professional license can be revoked or suspended other than temporarily only by a Court and not by the administrative agency itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.228" offset="2628315">The only power that the board has is under the statute which the Court here declared unconstitutional, Section 448.18 (7) and this statute allows the board to temporarily suspend the license of a licensee for not more than three months upon a determination that he is engaged in practices which are immoral or unprofessional in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.131" offset="2743881">They also have power to extend this for another three months but that's a maximum of their suspension powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.794" offset="2774497">Well, Dr. Larkin did get his license on the basis of reciprocity, he very promptly went to Milwaukee Wisconsin and he rented offices and he did so under an alias, he used name Glenn Johnson instead of his own name in renting these offices and he began performing abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.310" offset="2852655">He performed this every weekend.</text>

            <text syncTime="701.488" offset="2909288">It appears that by February of 1973, in other words, about a year-and-half after he started, he himself was coming to Milwaukee and only very infrequent occasions and evidence indicated that he was there once between February of 1973 and the date of this Federal Court activity in the latter of part of 1973.</text>

            <text syncTime="1114.825" offset="4562631">But at the point where he got this notice of a contested hearing, Dr. Larkin's attorney again went into Court and again sought a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, et cetera.</text>

            <text syncTime="1154.055" offset="4719574">So a three-judge court was then convened and the three-judge court held a none evidently hearing on the motion for preliminary injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1244.887" offset="5082885">His counsel sat through the entire investigative hearing and his counsel did address the board but Dr. Larkin himself never appeared and never informed the board despite its invitation of any material which would cast doubt upon or reflection upon the sworn testimony and other evidence that the board itself took during its investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.106" offset="5191764">But the three-judge court during this argument on preliminary injunction, off the bench, declares the statute unconstitutional and it also enjoins the use of the statute not only against Dr. Larkin but against everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.617" offset="5273788">It came down with the decision that -- and here I'm quoting them for the board temporarily to suspend Dr. Larkin's license which of course the board hadn't done, at its own contested hearing on charges evolving from its own investigation would constitute a denial to him of rights to procedural Due Process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.487" offset="5385279">Insofar as the statute authorizes a procedure where in a physician stands to lose his liberty or property, absent the intervention of an independent neutral and detached decision maker, we conclude that it is unconstitutional and enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.868" offset="5474826">So, in response to the motion for preliminary injunction, they did enter a decision declaring the statute unconstitutional, banning all utilization of the statute against everybody and then subsequently they came down with their judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.589" offset="5557687">Originally, they did this orally, then they wrote a decision, then they entered a judgment and in all of these they declared the statute unconstitutional and enjoined all utilization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.665" offset="5606066">From the judgment so declaring the appellant's appeal to this Court, this Court noted probable jurisdiction, my brief was submitted, the other side's brief was submitted and the board found itself with this order banning all utilization of the statute so crippling that the interest of the citizens of the state of Wisconsin were being harmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.317" offset="5720691">So the board did go to the three-judge court and asked for a modification so that the injunction would only protect Dr. Larkin and not prohibit the board from utilizing the statute against everybody.</text>

            <text syncTime="3065.971" offset="12367287">I made that those statements as contained in footnote 13 to the board and finally, the use of unlicensed physician, unlicensed in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.698" offset="12406157">There are two, there is a factual defense, one and a -- two factual defenses, one he was licensed in another country and under a prevailing opinion of the Attorney General, a doctor license or unlicensed to Wisconsin who was licensed elsewhere can practice in conjunction with the Wisconsin doctor and secondly, that an unlicensed doctor or person can practice medicine on the state of a medical emergency which is our opinion was created by the very board themselves due to their extensive harassment over a period of two years of persons in Wisconsin who engaged in the practice of abortions despite rulings from the Eastern and Western District of Wisconsin declaring the Wisconsin statute unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.214" offset="12600195">Dr. Larkin had to get his own restraining order because of the public threats by these Appellants and the public threats by the Attorney General of Wisconsin and District Attorney that they might not mind the orders of the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.977" offset="12675323">But those points have nothing to do with his professional competency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.616" offset="12693817">So there is no medical emergency in the picture to require such a drastic fast movement and I think that those factors are extremely important towards -- in determining when a due process allows faster activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.764" offset="12782425">Certainly, one of the factors would be whether there is an urgent situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.922" offset="12803009">In fact, the suggestion for mootness demonstrates some urgent situations which the board felt they needed relief from and that was in the case of two alcoholics and one narcotic actor -- addict doctor and for them they just want it to suspend their license even though they were a hazard to the community, to the state in general and indicated for them there will be rehabilitation available because they would not see provocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.526" offset="12917426">For an abortionist in the scene and a situation who may have used or allegedly use the wrong name on occasion or sign to list under wrong name or use the doctor unlicensed to Wisconsin or engaged in a fee splitting which we just dispute and deny, there is no hope for rehabilitation so apparently drug addicts and alcoholics get greater percentage --</text>
