            <text syncTime="50.671" offset="306030">The Louisiana constitutional provisions and statutory provisions are the same in this case is what is present in the Healy case, but there is this distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.660" offset="357961">The appellant here was charged with a serious criminal offense, a capital offense in the Louisiana, found guilty by a jury, an all male jury, chosen from an all male jury venire.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.360" offset="428805">A motion to quash the jury venire prior to trial was entered and denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.471" offset="457226">The motion was based on the ground that his rights to an impartial jury under the guarantees of the Sixth and Fourteen Amendment of the United States Constitution were denied him.</text>

            <label>Mr. William McM. King</label>
            <text syncTime="120.590" offset="585749">On its face we say the constitutional and statutory provisions which not only exempt, but exclude one is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.794" offset="630575">It provides for jury service only where the woman volunteers and excludes her from the jury unless she does volunteer.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.627" offset="661922">The stipulation of fact between the State and Healy are equally applicable to this case and that it occurred at the same time and during the same period and that stipulation show the complete failure of the volunteer system for women as adopted by the constitution under the states statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.754" offset="754395">The distinction in this, in the Healy case as we see it is that Healy have a Sixth Amendment question which arises because of this Court's opinion in Duncan versus Louisiana which opinion was rendered in 1968, this trial took place in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.820" offset="846660">In Duncan versus Louisiana, the Court will remember the right of a state court defendant in a serious criminal trial to a jury was granted him by application of the Sixth Amendment through the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.805" offset="914578">In Williams versus Florida, there was an attempt made to have this Court extend the application of Duncan versus Louisiana to a 12-man jury and the Court denied that extension on the grounds that numbers alone did not constitute the essential attribute of a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.989" offset="1023352">That same position was taken I believe by the Court in Apodaca where the number necessary to convict was at issue, but here the quality of the jury is at issue and an essential attribute of the jury trial is at issue for criminal defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="257.310" offset="1132648">In the very case which denied the extension to the 12-man jury, this Court declared what the essential attribute was.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.722" offset="1170265">It said that the purpose of a jury was to prevent oppression by government and that the manner in which it is exercised is by the jury being a barrier between the government or the accuser and the accused, and that in order to form an effective barrier, the Court stated that it is composed of representative segments of the community and that in denying that the 12-man jury applied to Louisiana, the Court looked to whether the number on the jury had the effect of denying that representative cross section of the community.</text>
