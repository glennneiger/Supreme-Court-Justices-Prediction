            <label>Mr. Mark L. Evans</label>
            <text syncTime="72.550" offset="393592">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.989" offset="407280">Under Title IV of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, the Secretary of Labor has given exclusive authority to file a civil action to set aside an election -- union election conducted in violation of the provisions of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.382" offset="476871">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in this case held that an unsuccessful union office seeker though barred by the act from being in action in his own name to set aside the election may bring an action against the union and the Secretary of Labor to compel the secretary to file a suit even though the secretary had already determined after an investigation that the members complaint was unmeritorious.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.901" offset="582928">The case arose on a complaint file with the secretary by respondent Bachowski alleging that there were violations in the conduct of an election in which he run unsuccessfully for the position of District Director of a United Steelworkers District.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.186" offset="648129">At about the same time, complaints were filed with respect -- excuse me, to elections in five other Steelworkers Districts and after an investigation of each complaint, the secretary filed suit to set aside two of those elections, but he determined not to file a suit in the case of Bachowski's district because he concluded on the basis of his investigation that the violations in that district did not affect the outcome of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.679" offset="758053">Bachowski then brought the present action in the District Court alleging that the violations did affect the outcome and that the secretary's refusal to bring an action was arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.306" offset="804551">The complaint sought an order compelling the secretary to bring an action in his name to set aside the election and directing the secretary in the union to extend the statutory 60-day period within which the secretary may file such an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.092" offset="871737">The District Court dismissed the complaint on jurisdictional grounds but the Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.221" offset="892217">It held that the factual basis for the secretary's determination that the violations did not affect the outcome of the election is subject to judicial review at the behest of the union member whose complaint was deemed by the secretary to be unmeritorious.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.000" offset="959404">That holding in our view was inconsistent with the enforcement scheme of Title IV of the Act because it would permit a complaining union member to circumvent the secretary's screening function under the act and subject the union to precisely the sort of intrusion upon its internal affairs that the act was so carefully designed to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.090" offset="1063685">The mechanism that was established by Congress to enforce the election rights guaranteed under Title IV reflects a delicate balance between the need under one hand to provide effective remedies for election abuses and the congressional concern on the other hand to avoid unnecessary interference in internal union affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.012" offset="1151457">Congress feared that needless intervention might endanger union self government and weaken the unions and their role as bargaining representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.693" offset="1190118">In the course of considering the act that ultimately was passed, the Congress considered and rejected a number of proposals that would have authorized individual union members to bring suits to set aside an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.395" offset="1248946">It was thought that such individual suits filed perhaps by union or unsuccessful candidates is a kind of continuation of pre-election in fighting would impose upon the unions the substantial burden of responding to unmeritorious and potentially harassing complaints and would place in the process a debilitating cloud over the title of the elected officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.972" offset="1351241">In the end, Congress chose to rely upon the discretion and expertise of the Secretary of Labor to perform a dispassionate screening function separating out the meritorious from the unmeritorious complaints and filing an action in his name with respect to those complains that he found to be meritorious.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.582" offset="1429713">The individual's role in this enforcement scheme is an essential but a very limited one.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.002" offset="1451342">He triggers the secretary's investigative and enforcement authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.952" offset="1471195">Without his complaint, the secretary can take no action but ones the secretary's authority has been invoked, he and he alone has the power to bring an action against the union to set aside the election within 60 days of the time the complaint was filed and then only if he finds probable cause to believe both that violations occurred in the conduct of the election and that those violations may have affected the outcome of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.500" offset="1577357">This Court accordingly held in the Calhoon case that the act prohibits union members from instituting a private suit to set aside an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.122" offset="1619884">The intention of Congress was to interpose the secretary between the complaining member and the courtroom in order to protect unions from potentially frivolous litigation and a consequent unnecessary interference with their internal functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.041" offset="1683519">As this Court stated in Trbovich, the intention was to insolate the union from any complaint that does not appear meritorious both to the complaining union member and to the secretary of labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.044" offset="1739525">The Court held in Trbovich that the acts objectives would not be defeated by permitting the member to intervene in an action already initiated by the secretary, so long as that intervention were limited to issues presented in the secretary's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.408" offset="1800965">The Court also held that the intervening member may not add issues which he originally complained of to the secretary but which the secretary found unmeritorious because that would be a circumvention of the very screening function that have been assigned under the act to the secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.804" offset="1874631">In our view, the Third Circuit's holding in the present case would permit a much more burdensome intrusion than the one that the Court held impermissible in Trbovich and that it would even more clearly allow a member to circumvent the secretary's screening function.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.456" offset="1933145">Although a suit to review the secretary's determination that litigation is unwarranted would inform perhaps be a suit against the secretary of labor, the union might well be named the defendant as indeed, the union was named the defendant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.426" offset="2001063">But even if it were not named, it would as a practical matter essential for the union to participate presumably as an intervener but no less than as an amicus.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.675" offset="2042023">In order to protect its rights in this what would amount to the critical stage of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.694" offset="2066160">The consequences of a determination that the secretary's refusal to file suit was so improperly based as to be arbitrary and capricious would obviously be damaging in the immediate future because a suit would presumably be filed by the secretary but in the long run because the issues had been fully adjudicated on a different burden through but fully adjudicated in the first action.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.313" offset="2180577">And in the course of this proceeding, while the issue presumably as the propriety of the secretary's investigation and decision making with respect to this particular complaint, it's inevitable that among the issues that it's going to be inquired into is the validity of the election itself, which is really the ultimate way you test to see whether the secretary's decision was arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.435" offset="2293112">As the Court ultimately held that the secretary abused his discretion in failing to bring an action on the member's complaint, the union would be at that point require either to try to persuade the same judge if it came before the same judge that he was wrong in the first place or if a different judge were assigned to the case, the union will have to put on its whole case again.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.169" offset="2384018">That double burden is far greater than the burden Congress thought it was imposing on the unions even if the Court found as it probably would that the secretary's action were not arbitrary and capricious, the union would still have been put to substantially the same burden in participating in this suit to review the secretary's determination that it would have been put to if individual member could have filed on his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.493" offset="2493315">It is the same burden that Congress was legislating against the burden of responding to potentially frivolous and harassing complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.021" offset="2531453">In the end, no matter what result the District Court reaches on the member's suit to review the secretary's determinations, the elected officers of the union would during the period of this litigation presumably subsequent appeals be functioning under a cloud upon their title to office.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.749" offset="2606373">That alone we submit would substantially defeat the acts policy of requiring prompt resolution of election disputes precisely to free the elected officials from the debilitating effects of a continuing doubt as to their legitimacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.145" offset="2663946">The result in some is substantially the result that Congress sought to prohibit in giving the secretary the exclusive authority to bring a post election lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.361" offset="2712848">Unions under the Third Circuit's rule could be held into Court without limitation, they would be subject to potentially frivolous complaints and the secretary's authority to insolate the union from those complaints and from an unnecessary interference with their internal affairs would be wholly emasculated.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.548" offset="2789543">His screening function in effect would be transferred to the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.235" offset="2812322">The Court of Appeals' response to this argument which respondent 1122 in its brief appears at pages 9 (a) to 11 (a) of the petition of the Government, the appendix for petition of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.305" offset="2896541">The Court stated first that a suit to review the secretary's decision not to sue would not subject unions to unnecessary interference because the secretary's decision would be overturn only when there was a compelling showing that he ignored a meritorious complaint, but to say that there would be a heavy burden upon the complaining member does not negate the intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.148" offset="2999986">The interference is not simply the ultimate danger of having the election overturn but the very process of the judicial review which necessarily entails a response to claims that the election was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.374" offset="3064874">Congress recognized that a union's internal affairs are intruded upon and its resources are taxed whenever it is held into Court to defendants election and that is why it sought to insolate the union from frivolous complaints if the only worry were the ultimate overturning of the election, there would have been no need to insolate the union from frivolous complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.887" offset="3162885">So the burden of proof makes no difference in the ultimate burden upon -- and the ultimate damage to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.064" offset="3199666">Second, the Court stated that unions would remain protected from frivolous claims because the secretary would bare the primary responsibility for defending against the suit to compel the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.067" offset="3243656">What is unrealistic I submit to suppose that the union would not actively participate in support of its own elections and since any dissatisfied member could presumably under the Third Circuits ruling bring a collateral action of the sort that was brought by Mr. Bachowski here.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.634" offset="3317948">No matter how unmeritorious his complaint, there would be no protection at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.312" offset="3340622">The union's theoretical right to let the secretary carry the weight of a litigation is not likely to be invoked simply because there is too much at stake for the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.678" offset="3382105">Third, the Court stated that in -- a subsequent suit by the secretary of the member's collateral attack were successful would be centralized in a single proceeding that I conceive as an effort to satisfy the second of the purposes that this Court stated in Trbovich, which was meant -- in Trbovich was meant to be served by the enforcement scheme that is to centralize in a single proceeding such litigation has might be warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.767" offset="3498402">But that itself is in substantial doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.772" offset="3514493">Presumably a member who brings this suite to review the secretary's decision not to sue could file it either in Washington D.C. or in his home district.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.450" offset="3553155">The secretary is limited under the statute to suing the union if he ultimately brings a suit in the headquarters of the union in this district in which the union headquarters is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.680" offset="3598085">So there's no guarantee that we're going to be -- you know, this sets -- this new proceeding is going to be even in the same Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.908" offset="3618983">But even if it were, it creates problems I've alluded to earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.176" offset="3640090">If it comes before the same judge, the judge is mine, is essentially made up and said next to impossible burden for the union in the second proceeding to adequately hope to defend itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.958" offset="3695156">And if it goes to a second judge, the union has to put on the second round of defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.917" offset="3735071">Finally, on page 11 (a) the Court minimized the damaging effect of a -- on a union of having to function under cloud on the title of the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.538" offset="3781569">In its view that concern maybe subordinated to the goal of providing an effective remedy for election of regularities, but Congress though differently, it subordinated that concern only to the extent provided in the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.554" offset="3833605">Although the Courts have properly permitted the secretary to bring an action outside the 60-day period, when the union itself has waived the 60-day period or where the union itself has obstructed the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.284" offset="3888462">That that kind of estoppel isn't present here and those brief delays are incomparable to the obviously lengthy delays that would be involved here, it maybe months or years before the secretary ultimately files the complaint if the Court tells him he has to.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.118" offset="3967875">And of course, during all that time, the union members, the elected officers would be suffering under this doubt as to the legitimacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.843" offset="3994728">Respondent argues that Trbovich doesn't control this case because the issue of reviewability was not presented in that case and I think strictly speaking, he's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.033" offset="4031509">The Court held only that the intervening member could not raise additional issues that were not deemed meritorious by the secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.372" offset="4060871">But on respondent's theory, Trbovich, though barred from raising those additional issues as an intervener in the secretary's action could have simply gone out and started the separate proceeding to review the secretary's refusal to include those issues in his own proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.412" offset="4125027">That would surely have been more burdensome to the union, more cumbersome to the Courts and I think much more damaging to the acts policies than simply presenting the new issues in the on going proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.749" offset="4186363">While the Court in Trbovich did not concededly expressly consider whether this collateral review proceeding would be proper, there can't be much doubt how that issue should be resolved in light of the principles of Trbovich.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.309" offset="4252609">A suit to review with the secretary's determination would effectively circumvent the secretary's screening function and just like the new issue intervention in Trbovich and just like the separate suit in Calhoon, a suit to review the secretary's decision not to sue is barred by the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1353.434" offset="5517145">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.739" offset="5530311">Congress when it enacted the Landrum-Griffin Act, it spent more time on shaping the enforcement remedy of Title IV than almost any other of its provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.673" offset="5570017">And it spent so much time because it really had two essentially conflicting objectives that it was trying to accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.819" offset="5602617">And it was trying to calibrate precisely the right balance between them so that it had an effective enforcement mechanism but one that was not going to injure its other concern and that other concern was that unions be able to function effectively and that they have stability of leadership and that their leadership not always be under a cloud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.024" offset="5687463">Now, how did Congress shaped that balance?</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.411" offset="5701047">We know of course that their one concern, the major concern was to have democratic union elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.226" offset="5724244">And to that end, they enacted not only a very comprehensive substantive code but they put the full weight of the Federal Government into the enforcement of that code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.183" offset="5764054">They said the labor department shall investigate at the behest of any member and if the secretary of labor found probable cause that a violation may have occurred that he bring a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.769" offset="5806477">Now, I might say that there is no other election in this county, public or private that's regulated as extensively, either substantively or in terms of the enforcement machinery as union elections are under Title IV and that so whether or not you add to that arsenal the additional item of judicial review that is sought in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.690" offset="5894144">Now, though Congress provided that arsenal of enforcement, substantive and enforcement machinery, it was also very concerned about the implications of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.355" offset="5932805">And the implication it was most concerned about was that if in every union election, there could then be a subsequent legal challenge which could go on indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.400" offset="5977004">The title to union office would be under a continuing cloud and the capacity of unions to function would be adversely affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.686" offset="6010128">Congressman after all or politician, they know that in an election year, there is some legislation that doesn't get passed or considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.009" offset="6039385">There are some steps that aren't taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.408" offset="6048998">And they were concerned that if union elections could be under a constant challenge, union officers would be like elected officials in the election year all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.287" offset="6088495">They would always be pulling their shots for fear, number one that there's an election right around the corner and not only would they be pulling their shots but the employees who look to them for direction and the employers who have to deal with them at the bargaining table would not be certain, number one, whether these people were ever properly elected in the first place and number two, whether they're still going to be there a week from now, and it would affect and vitally affect the whole collective bargaining process and the whole internal process of unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.111" offset="6215868">And so, though Congress created this machinery for enforcing union democracy, it also provided very carefully for when the curtain would be run down on that machinery and when it could be said, okay, members of this union, your officers have now been finally determined, the status is no longer under a cloud, employers know who to deal with, employees know who to look to and you shall now go on for the duration of the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.694" offset="6326105">And to that end, Congress number one, could very reach a time limit into the complaint mechanism of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.148" offset="6351914">Members have to go to the secretary within a specified time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.664" offset="6366020">If the secretary is going to sue, he has to bring that lawsuit within a specified time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.627" offset="6385873">Congress was anxious in that way, it said time was of the essence to end the cloud on title of the union office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.976" offset="6415235">Beyond that, Congress expressly took away the right of individual union members to institute these lawsuits because that would have left to any union member the capacity to put the union title under cloud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.150" offset="6471973">And finally, what Congress did was to say that this action which the secretary of labor could bring if he found that there were violations that may have affected the outcome was exclusive so that it ay clear that if the secretary reach the contrary determination, there would not indeed be a continuing cloud over the union office, the curtain would ring down, the officer's title would be clearly established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.356" offset="6576776">Now, to allow the suits of the type that's involved here totally undoes that statutory structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.372" offset="6604884">It totally undoes it because it puts back in the hands of every union candidate in every union election the capacity to indefinitely leave title to union office under a cloud.</text>

            <text syncTime="1715.642" offset="6965896">Now, if all we were concerned about was the fact that theoretically one member in that rare case in a million where the secretary is arbitrary could institute a lawsuit, the concern about clouding union title wouldn't be very great.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.642" offset="7021902">But I think we have to realistically recognize that there are incentives to bring these lawsuits other than the prospects which are always going to be small that they can be successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.914" offset="7063071">The losing candidate in the union election if he hopes to run again needs a forum to keep his name in attention, to keep his charges against his opponent alive and these lawsuits are magnificent vehicles for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.989" offset="7115316">There's nothing the media of more than internal union conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.061" offset="7127646">The filing of this lawsuit is attracted enormous media attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.575" offset="7145723">The charges that are made in the complaint in this lawsuit have been repeatedly recited in the press in the Pittsburg area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.957" offset="7179160">And of course, there's also the opportunity for discovery which is useful to a candidate who'd like to find that with which to campaign next time around.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.672" offset="7214059">So that these lawsuits will be seen as attractive vehicles by candidates irrespective of whether they think there's any realistic chance of setting the secretary's decision aside as arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.641" offset="7261915">And thus, you can anticipate that in order to accommodate that one case in a million where the secretary is arbitrary, you're going to totally topple the congressional concern that union officer's titles not be under an indefinite cloud at the behest of any union member.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.203" offset="7324191">Now in closing, I'd like to note that we think the -- though the statutory interpretation question is clear, there would be a very serious constitutional question if this Court were to read the statute differently than we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.813" offset="7378631">Never at least as far as any of these parties have been able to find, as the Federal Courts ever directed the executive branch to bring a lawsuit before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.646" offset="7417919">There's a serious separation of powers question of whether the Court assumes a prosecutorial, mental when it not only directs the secretary to file a lawsuit but of necessity tells him what allegations to include in the complaint in that lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.111" offset="7479777">And the Court would have to do that because after all not every one of the dozens of charges that the complainant may bring to the Court was necessarily so powerful that the secretary was arbitrary and capricious and not suing about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.941" offset="7531186">The Courts is going to have to shift through those and say Mr. Secretary, I think you oath to sue on items 1, 5, 9 and 12, you are arbitrary and capricious on those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.485" offset="7569324">So the Courts in the process of telling the executive branch, file a complaint before me, here are the allegations I want you to make and it's ironic that under a statute in which Congress evidence no intent for such review that we would have to get to such a constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.595" offset="7633795">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1892.343" offset="7672769">This case is rendered simple by two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.262" offset="7692413">First, the provision of the verified complaint admitted before this Court that the secretary's own investigation substantiated our allegations of violation and affected the outcome of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.229" offset="7760332">We pleaded more than we have to Mr. Justice White, you made the point that says only that the violations, we pleaded the violations, the secretary found them and that they may have -- and more -- this -- the most statute could require is that they may have affected the outcome, we pleaded that they did affect the outcome, that's admitted before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.449" offset="7857194">Second, that's paragraph 18 of our complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.805" offset="7878614">Second, the statute provides that under the admitted circumstances of this case on the complaint namely that the secretary's own investigation found violations which affected the outcome of the election, the secretary shall sue to upset the election..</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.912" offset="7963042">Not may sue but shall sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.634" offset="7973909">If you look at the Government's brief on page 3 where they set forth, the statute -- secretary -- the statutes reads, the secretary shall investigate such a complaint and if he finds probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.915" offset="8026990">And the most that probable cause could mean is that there are violations and they may have affected the outcome, we pleaded more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.309" offset="8056560">If he finds probable cause to believe there has been a violation, he shall bring a civil action.</text>

            <text syncTime="3656.108" offset="14727816">Very briefly Mr. Chief Justice, I just want to point out that paragraph 18 of the complaint does not allege that the secretary found probable cause to believe that the violations affected the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.755" offset="14778389">This Court stated in Glass Bottle Blowers that the secretary may not file suit unless he finds probable cause to believe that the violation that did occur infected the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.429" offset="14825096">Second, I want to point out because it didn't arise at all during Mr. Rauh's argument that the secretary in compliance with the mandate of the Court of Appeals and the subsequent order by the District Court submitted what prints out to 15 pages of statement of reasons in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.236" offset="14896358">Now, while we don't raise the issue of whether the secretary must submit a statement of reasons in this case, we don't necessarily concede that he's is required by law to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.247" offset="14936377">We didn't bring that issue here because as a practical matter, the secretary --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3714.346" offset="14960724">They did -- they said we do have to in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.928" offset="14971068">They didn't make a general -- they implied that we'd have to do it continually, but I mean that we know, we didn't bring the issue because the facts of the matter is the secretary always does at least the last five years I'm told provide as a brief statement of reasons with respect to every case that he closes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.432" offset="15037106">And if a complaining member is unhappy with that letter that he receives, he is always entitled to ask the secretary for a fuller statement and they always accommodate to the extent they can whatever request they get.</text>

            <text syncTime="3759.725" offset="15142222">A very briefed and summary letter because the time was short, the 60th day was coming very soon and the case was enormously complex and it was important from the secretary's relationship with the complaining member to let him know as quickly as possible what the determination was.</text>
