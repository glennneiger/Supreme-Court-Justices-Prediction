            <text syncTime="33.974" offset="239261">My name is Charles Davis of Jackson Mississippi, along with Mr. Walter Armstrong, Mr. Hubert McBride of Memphis, and Mr. Tom Tardy, also of Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.039" offset="299551">I represent the petitioner in this case, W. M. Gurley, doing business as Gurley Oil Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.906" offset="346990">This action was brought by Mr. Gurley for the recovery or refund of sales taxes imposed by the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.949" offset="391189">The trial court and the Supreme Court of Mississippi denied Mr. Gurley’s claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.449" offset="421177">This Court granted certiorari on November 18, 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.478" offset="449285">The issue on this appeal and in the proceedings below was stipulated by the parties and that is contained at page 36 of the 10 appendix, and that issue is whether or not federal and state gasoline excise taxes are properly or legally includable in gross proceeds of sale or in the sales price of gasoline under the Mississippi Sales Tax Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.394" offset="620962">Now Mr. Gurley's contention is that he collects these two excise taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.257" offset="648443">That is the federal excise tax on gasoline and the state excise tax on gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.751" offset="678327">And that he makes this collection as an agent of the United States and of the State of Mississippi.</text>

            <text syncTime="152.211" offset="712182">If I get you're argument correctly in your briefs Mr. Davis, you're saying the state has no more right to tax him for being this conduit than they could tax an Internal Revenue Agent who collects the money and passes it on to the collector in Mississippi, is that about it?</text>

            <text syncTime="171.493" offset="789295">That's correct Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.949" offset="799117">We are saying that he merely acts as an agent because of the point in the process of distribution than he happens to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.483" offset="849272">He is the closest to the consumer of the gasoline and logically and practically, the tax scheme of both statutes imposes this duty of collection, reporting and payment to the tax authorities on him.</text>

            <text syncTime="216.637" offset="969958">I take it in the latter case the Supreme Court of Mississippi is free to decide who the tax is imposed on and what role the tax collector has in a way that it isn't where you've got a federal statute?</text>

            <text syncTime="258.971" offset="1139231">Well, we've cited authorities in our brief which we believe indicates that where constitutional questions are presented such as we have here where if Mr. Gurley is taxed a sales tax by the state of Mississippi is imposed upon Mississippi gasoline excise taxes in his hands that that's to take his property without due process of law, and therefore we submit that this Court may look to the operation and effect of the Mississippi statute and determine that despite the ruling by the Mississippi Supreme Court that it is a tax on the consumer of gasoline.</text>

            <text syncTime="400.241" offset="1704312">So, we are asking this Court to determine the incidence of these two gasoline excise taxes and secondly, we are saying that the Court may in the case of Mr. Gurley, who is actually a retailer of gasoline that it may determine that even though the incidence is on the seller that if the taxes accrue at the time of sale that's its impossible for these taxes to be included in gross proceeds or as a part of the sales price, and therefore, the State of Mississippi cannot impose a sales tax on it at that juncture, the sales tax accruing at that time simultaneously on the retail sale of the gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.384" offset="1932936">I would like to briefly state to the Court a little bit about Mr. Gurley's operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.355" offset="1972746">The amount of the taxes here was actually stipulated and that's in summary of that is found at page 36 of the 10 appendix.</text>

            <text syncTime="490.029" offset="2063444">He refused to pay the taxes and additional assessments were rendered by the State of Mississippi, at which time he did pay them but throughout the period involved in the case at bar, he bore himself the burden of all these taxes that he seeks the refund for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.068" offset="2155604">Mr. Gurley is a small independent gasoline operator.</text>

            <text syncTime="643.858" offset="2678784">And at that point, Mr. Gurley imposed the 5% Mississippi sales tax on the 20 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.157" offset="2719953">Now, he separately, he contends, collects the federal excise tax on gasoline and the state excise tax on gasoline, and during all of this period, he did not impose nor pass on any 5% sales tax on the two excise taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2693.770" offset="10878412">Now, with respect to Mr. Justice White's question, I'd understood they referred to the federal excise tax and its inclusion in the sales tax based by virtue of this Mississippi decision which was made on the basis of the fact that as a matter of federal law that is an incident, a legal incident placed upon the wholesaler and not upon the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.284" offset="10988544">I think that it is rather essential to the issue here to get down to something that was asked by Mr. Justice Powell and that is whether Mr. Gurley is a wholesaler or a retailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.789" offset="11046536">I think he is in fact both because under the definition of producer or distributor, he is that and becomes liable for the tax when he brings it in to Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.894" offset="11094915">The fact that he chooses to sell it directly to the ultimate consumer does not prevent him from being under the language of the statute a producer or distributor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.903" offset="11139009">The effect of Mr. Gurley's position being sustained would be that all those retailers who purchase from wholesalers would have to include the excise tax in the sales tax base but Mr. Gurley would be excused from including it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.567" offset="11221661">And therefore, we would argue that if there are any federal constitutional issues here, they mitigate in favor of the system that the respondent has urged and that the Mississippi Court has adopted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3178.551" offset="12817533">The petitioner cites a number of cases in which the merchant or some other person has been held to be a trustee for the federal government in the collection of certain federal taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.323" offset="12876675">In the principal case cited in the body of the brief, Pazner (ph) versus O'Connell, the jewelry excise tax as I understand the statute was placed upon the retail sale to the customer and that made the jeweler a collector or trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.332" offset="12960684">Likewise, the toll bridge tax in the United States versus Washington Toll Bridge cited in the footnote was imposed on the person who was paying for the use of the toll bridge by statute, again a trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.525" offset="13033514">The United States versus First Capital National Bank was a tax imposed upon the price of admission to collegiate athletic functions by the United States and again as a trustee situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.514" offset="13101432">We submit that that is entirely distinct from the instant case in which both the federal and state statutes are imposed upon the producer or wholesaler.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.598" offset="13169768">We would submit that there is nothing in the cases which have been decided by this Court since the Panhandle Oil Company decision which give credence to the argument of the petitioner that this Court has determined that the federal gasoline excise tax is placed upon the consumer in the King and Boozer decision which we think specifically overruled in part the Panhandle decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.424" offset="13325040">The opinion of the Court stated to the extent that this Court had adopted a doctrine of economic burden as determining legal incidence, that doctrine was repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.194" offset="13380106">In the subsequent case of Kern-Limerick cited by the petitioner, no modification of King and Boozer was done by this Court, but there was simply a finding that as a matter of fact, the United States Navy was the purchaser of tractors and therefore was immune from the placement of the Arkansas sales tax which was placed on the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.115" offset="13503822">We would submit that the language of the Illinois Court in the Martin case, its rational as adopted by the Mississippi Court in this case is persuasive of the fact that the federal tax is not a tax placed upon the ultimate consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.304" offset="13580622">That it is a tax placed upon the wholesaler.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.551" offset="13613537">The question was asked by Mr. Justice Stewart as to whether or not the Mississippi sales tax is in issue and I understood counsel to say that the validity of the Mississippi sales tax is not in issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3403.907" offset="13718967">That that language itself includes both of this excise taxes in the tax based from which the sales taxes are computed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.460" offset="13777168">The question has been asked several times as to whether or not the Mississippi Law requires that the excise tax be passed on to the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.402" offset="13820949">The answer to that question is definitely no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.727" offset="13834324">In the statute before its last amendment in 1970, there was a provision that the tax could be passed along to the consumer and that provision was eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.830" offset="13886673">There has never been a provision that the tax must be passed along to the consumer and this question was addressed in by the Georgia Supreme Court in the Thoni Oil cases in which the Georgia Court held that the federal tax was includable because it did not have to be passed on except as an economic burden if at the discretion of the payer of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.484" offset="13981341">While on the other hand, the Georgia statute was so written that the Georgia tax would be passed on.</text>
