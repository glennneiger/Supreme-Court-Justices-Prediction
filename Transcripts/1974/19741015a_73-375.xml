            <text syncTime="40.080" offset="263711">I represent William Otte, the Trustee in Bankruptcy of Freedomland, the petitioner before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.398" offset="292968">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.443" offset="313135">The facts of this case are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.666" offset="325987">Freedomland filed a petition under Chapter XI of Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.499" offset="341347">It was subsequently adjudicated as bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.706" offset="354200">413 priority wage claimant's file proofs of claim for a priority wage claims in the bankruptcy proceeding during the six month period, during which claims could be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.859" offset="410833">The United States government and the city of New York did not file any claims for withholding taxes or related taxes in connection with those priority wage claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.750" offset="446360">As a matter of fact, they did not file any proofs of claim pursuant to the bar order entered in the proceeding which directed the taxing authorities to file proofs of claim, if they had any claims for withholding or related taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.944" offset="519189">During the course of the proceeding, the bankruptcy judge entered an order authorizing the bankruptcy trustee to make a priority wage claim distribution, without the necessity for withholding taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.551" offset="573628">This order was appealed to the District Court and the District Court held that it was incumbent upon the bankruptcy trustee to withhold taxes and that the withheld taxes were subject to the fourth priority of Section 64 (a) of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.129" offset="635904">On further appeal to the Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals held that the withheld taxes were subject to the second priority under Section 64 (a) of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.306" offset="680626">Now, the issues before the Court are first; whether a bankruptcy trustee is required to withhold taxes in connection with a priority wage claim distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.576" offset="717720">Second, whether those withheld taxes are entitled to a priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.327" offset="736632">Third, whether the ruling of the bankruptcy judge that it was not incumbent upon a bankruptcy trustee to prepare the W-2 forms and related forms because it was consistent with the general rule that a bankruptcy trustee need not incur unnecessary expenses in connection with the administration of mistake whether that ruling was clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.100" offset="843734">And fourth, whether it was incumbent upon the taxing authorities to file proofs of claim in this proceeding or be barred from asserting their claim in the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.541" offset="893576">Essential, absolutely crucial to an understanding of this case is that it is a bankruptcy case, it is not a tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.948" offset="935163">Every appellate court that has dealt with the issues before the Court today, has viewed the issues in terms of the Internal Revenue Code and has viewed the cases before them as tax cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.740" offset="994304">I submit to the Court that this is a bankruptcy case and that if this Court recognizes that it’s a bankruptcy case that it will overrule all of the appellate courts that have dealt with the issues before the Court and will overrule the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.517" offset="1053445">Section 64 (a) (2) of the Bankruptcy Act establishes a priority wage claim for wage earners.</text>

            <text syncTime="272.152" offset="1191999">Now, this Court has dealt with Section 64 (a) (2) in two significant cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.775" offset="1218435">The Embassy Restaurant case and the Joint Industry Board case, this Court ruled, decided that Congress when it passed Section 64 (a) exempted to establish an economic cushion for wage earners who lost their jobs as a result of their employer's bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.072" offset="1315610">Now, I ask this Court in light of the obvious congressional purpose related to Section 64 (a) (2) whether withholding taxes in connection with a priority wage claim distribution would fulfill that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.653" offset="1377991">I say that it would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.554" offset="1385618">Moreover, in interpreting Section 64 (a) (2), this Court has said that it was incumbent upon a bankruptcy trustee to make a prompt distribution of the priority wage claim dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.009" offset="1447372">Yet, if a bankruptcy trustee is required to workout the computations and prepare the W-2s and 941s and the related forms, it is inevitable that there will be delay in the distribution and again I say, that any requirement that would cause a bankruptcy trustee to delay a distribution would not fulfill the congressional purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="572.775" offset="2394467">It’s unfair to him, and it servers no valid purpose, the Brookings Institute report in its study indicates that taxes collected in connection with bankruptcy proceedings have a minuscule effect on the treasury.</text>

            <text syncTime="657.147" offset="2731969">Well, I was just suggesting that it's a general policy, the revision -- the proposed revision of the Bankruptcy Act suggested by the Brookings Institute that the amount of taxes collected are minuscule.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.162" offset="2792051">Suggested to them that priority taxes in general should be abolished in bankruptcy proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.729" offset="2818278">I’m further submitting that the government will not really be hurt in this particular case if we follow the suggestion that the trustee is making that no money be withheld, and that the wage earner at the end of the year if owes a tax, pays a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.674" offset="2882017">Now, the government has recognized that the trustee might have some difficulty computing the deduction, and accordingly, they have established a bureaucratic practice that as far as I am concerned has no basis in law and not subject to any particular regulation but there is some kind of practice that the bankruptcy trustee take 25% off the top.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.201" offset="2976162">Well, the withholding tax statutes run from 14% on upwards and I submit that in the kind of cases we’re talking about where they are all wage earners and you are not talking about principles of business, or businesses, or salary personnel but just wage earners that 25% is excessive.</text>

            <text syncTime="823.980" offset="3399241">It had to conclude that the bankruptcy trustee was in control of wage claim dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.624" offset="3421915">Much like the other appellate courts, the court below simply ignored the bankruptcy context of this case and the point of fact, the bankruptcy trustee does not control the distribution of wage claim dividends, it’s the bankruptcy judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.402" offset="3492968">The bankruptcy judge appoints the trustee, the bankruptcy judge has a right in certain instances to remove the trustee, the bankruptcy judge declares the dividends, the bankruptcy judge must countersign the checks, and the bankruptcy judge mails out the checks.</text>

            <text syncTime="967.574" offset="3973622">The government contends that the withheld taxes, taxes withheld on the second priority are bootstrapped to the first priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.028" offset="4007476">This is illogical.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.425" offset="4017089">And in addition to that, it’s not only illogical but it's contrary to the holding of this Court in (Inaudible) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.416" offset="4041017">The withheld funds are taxes that are withheld from the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.434" offset="4057109">They are not expenses of the state and it’s only the expenses of the state that can be deemed to be administration expenses and would entitle the government to priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.755" offset="4106428">The city of New York says, as to the court below, that the withheld taxes are entitled to a second priority because they are “carved out” of the wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.403" offset="4144985">Yet this Court in the Embassy Restaurant case said that, “If anything is paid to a third party to someone other than the wage claimant that the moneys that are paid are not wages for purposes of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.751" offset="4206425">So you cannot conclude that withheld tax is paid to the government can fall in to the second priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.916" offset="4235055">The Connecticut Motor Lines case says, “that the withheld taxes fall into the fourth priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.789" offset="4262536">Well, the taxes here are not the taxes of the bankrupt and the fourth priority only relates to taxes of the bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.871" offset="4290853">Now, the petitioner does not concede that any taxes should be withheld at all, but if taxes are withheld and if the taxes do not fall within the priority category of Section 64 (a) (4) then perhaps they fall into the proviso that follows Section 64 (a) (4) which says that if a tax is not entitled to a priority that it falls into the general unsecured claim category.</text>

            <text syncTime="1468.064" offset="5975646">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.678" offset="5986095">I represent the United States in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.410" offset="5996962">Mr. Warms who would follow me, represents the city of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.757" offset="6014412">Three related questions are presented to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.369" offset="6024861">First, whether a trustee in bankruptcy must withhold income and social security taxes on the distribution of the wage claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.823" offset="6058715">Second, whether the taxing authorities must file formal proofs of claims with respect to these withholding taxes, and third, whether such taxes are entitled to first priority of payment or are payable in some other manner under the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.917" offset="6123081">As to the first question, the trustees' duty to withhold, not withstanding the trustees arguments here, the law is quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.204" offset="6156204">The Internal Revenue Code squarely requires the trustee in bankruptcy to withhold federal income and social security taxes on all wage claim distributions and to prepare and submit appropriate information returns and reports to the Internal Revenue Service and to the wage claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.206" offset="6232168">The evidence in this case shows that contrary to the petitioners position, the cost of complying with these withholding and reporting requirements are trivial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.617" offset="6269889">And in any event, even if the costs were more substantial they would not justify the trustees' failure to perform a statutory duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.728" offset="6298311">Our arguments to this effect are set forth in our brief and if there are no questions on this point and in the rest of time, I will go on to the other questions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.300" offset="6340524">As to the second question in this case, the filings of proofs of claims, we believe that it is also clear that no filings of proofs of claims are required with respect to withholding taxes that arise after bankruptcy as in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.555" offset="6405622">The Bankruptcy Act requires the filing of formal proofs of claims only with respect to debts for which the bankrupt is or maybe liable and the bankrupt will never become liable for the withholding taxes in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.236" offset="6468315">These taxes arise only after bankruptcy and their obligations incurred by the state in the course of administration and not by the bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.110" offset="6511783">In this respect, they’re just like the expenses incurred by the trustee and employing clerical assistance to help administer the estate indeed are just like the costs incurred by the trustee in conducting this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.776" offset="6570506">Withholding taxes like other expenses incurred in a course of administration or obligations of the state which -- as I say which are incurred in the course of administration and the Bankruptcy Act does not require the filing proofs of claims with respect to such debts of the state as distinguished from debts of the bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.887" offset="6658905">Moreover, the purpose of filing proofs of claims is simply to inform the bankruptcy trustee and the other creditors of the total amount of claims outstanding against the bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.049" offset="6707597">Proofs of claims of withholding taxes here in question but not serve that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.601" offset="6729749">These withholding taxes do not add to the total amount of claims against the bankrupt or the estate, they arise only when the wage claims are paid out, they're deducted from the wage claims, paid over to the United States and they don’t reduce the fund remaining for payment to other creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.774" offset="6798503">Therefore, filing the proofs of claims would serve no purpose under the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.596" offset="6821804">Moreover, any filing requirement of that kind for the government would be impracticable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.375" offset="6840822">As we showed in our brief, the Bankruptcy Act requires proofs of claims to be filed as to debts of the bankrupt, within six months of the first date set, the first meeting of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.918" offset="6891081">No taxing authority could comply fully with that requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.537" offset="6909471">Until the expiration of the six month period, it would be impossible to know just how much wage claims in fact were to be payable out of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.303" offset="6948551">Moreover, the actual amount of the tax that they would be due cannot be known until the actual amount of wages has been calculated and distributed because withholding rates fluctuate over time and the effective withholding rates at the time of bankruptcy maybe very different from those that are in effect at the time of the distribution of the wage claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.973" offset="7031306">Therefore, for all of these reasons, we believe it’s clear that Congress did not intend to require the filings of proofs of claims with respect to these withholding taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.324" offset="7080626">With that in mind, I now turn to what we believe is the most important and substantial question in this case and that is the priority to which the United States is entitled or more generally a manner in which these withholding taxes are to be paid over to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.455" offset="7157217">Under Section 7501 of the Internal Revenue Code an obligation is imposed upon all persons responsible for collecting taxes to hold those taxes in a special fund and trust for the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.439" offset="7225135">Under that provision, withholding taxes of the kind here in question or indeed any other withholding taxes are directly payable to the United States as a trust fund without regard to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.763" offset="7282395">However, the trustee in this case is not complied with the Section 7501, and we've recognized that under this court's holding in United States against Randall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.600" offset="7321788">The trustees' duty to pay over cannot be enforced as against third party creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.560" offset="7345612">The issue that arises in this case therefore as to what priority of payment if any, the United States is entitled when the trustee defaults on his duty to pay over the withholding taxes as a trust fund, and I turn now to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.854" offset="7406738">Our position, simply put is that the United States is entitled to payment of these withholding taxes as the first priority administrative cost and expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.145" offset="7447907">We reach this conclusion, both because such withholding taxes analytically fall within the category of administrative expenses and also because they don’t fit within any other priority or indeed non-priority category.</text>

            <text syncTime="2702.833" offset="10914670">It'll be calculated on the amount of each wage paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.135" offset="10931911">Now, another reason we for our argument is it avoids the trustees' argument but in the administration expense mostly in the preservation of the estate or in connection with the acquisition of assets, we don't have to argue against that in presenting it as a second wage, a second priority wage claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.991" offset="11031385">Now, I don't do -- I've worked some of Mr. Justice Blackmun's questioning concerning the Fogarty case because that was the leading case and that was the case on which from this notion of administration expense priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.230" offset="11092302">Actually, I'm not sure that the Fogarty case wasn't correct because in the Fogarty case, there was no withholding as far we can see.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.057" offset="11139636">I believe the wage distributions were made without any withholding of tax and that the taxes were actually satisfied by offsetting them against the claim which the bankrupt had against the government for some ships that had built.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.174" offset="11212048">Now that means, probably that they were rightfully decided to be administration expenses because they weren't carved out of the wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.637" offset="11253948">The wages went 100% to the wage claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.215" offset="11272234">The other came out of the estate and so, although the case was followed in Lines against California and then in the Curtis case in Ninth and Sixth Circuits which both held that the administration expense status was accorded to these claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.312" offset="11336600">I think we should bear in mind that Fogarty which was the father of all these cases is perhaps reconcilable with our view in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.938" offset="11375156">Now, we say that the wage claim status depends on this.Withholding taxes are derived from and carved out of the actual wages paid to an employee and the wage distribution paid to a wage claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.181" offset="11456136">There is if there an in envisioned assignment by the wage claimant to the governments involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.742" offset="11486333">Of that point of his wages which might reasonably be assumed to cover his taxes, the minute these taxes are withheld, he gets a credit on the books of the governments, for these withholdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.162" offset="11540041">If he (Voice Overlap) satisfying his taxing indebtedness if for example he's made estimates, he'll get those withholdings back in the form of the refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.513" offset="11581419">So he will ultimately realize in that case, what essentially his wages is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.392" offset="11604929">He is required to include them in gross income, his income tax returns and this shows too that the amount of the withholding part of his salary and therefore are wages.</text>

            <text syncTime="2891.946" offset="11671176">Mr. Warms, is this like a prior theories which I think emerged first time in this case in the Second Circuit, is this your argument below that the court pick it up on it's own clear argument?</text>

            <text syncTime="2907.085" offset="11731675">I say that because it makes me to appear to be very veined of try to support that in the case were I need not necessarily do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.351" offset="11760828">But it was indeed my argument and the Court was very kind and flattering me doing about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.331" offset="11796668">Part of an argument also is that proper segregation was made of these funds, they would also enjoy a trust funds status within the second -- within the range of the second priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.117" offset="11843793">Now, I've spoken about what I consider to be the unfounded fears of the federal government in the event that second wage -- second priority status has accorded these wage claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.098" offset="11907741">Finally I think I should point out that there is an anomaly in computing them, if that to be considered as administration expenses because administration expenses have to be computed before you can determine how much money is left in the state to pay wage claims, and it's only after you have determined how much you have left to wage claims that you can compute the taxes on them.</text>
