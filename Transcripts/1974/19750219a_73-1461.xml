            <text syncTime="74.870" offset="402892">This was a divorce proceeding in which the wife had been awarded custody of two children and the husband had been ordered to pay support money for the two children.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.817" offset="470601">Some years after the entry of the divorce decree, the wife filed a proceeding in the District Court to have some past due support money reduced to judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.694" offset="530160">She contended that the husband was obligated to continue to pay support money for the children even though the wife or the daughter had achieved the age of 18 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.699" offset="898173">However, there was a statute enacted three years before this divorce in 1957 and which was the Uniform Civil Liability for Support Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.864" offset="942791">In that statute, a child was defined as being child of either age under the age of 20 or either sex under the age of 21.</text>

            <text syncTime="1168.653" offset="4777984">One of them being that its a mans primary responsibility to provide a home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.938" offset="4795120">This was the breadwinner argument which was rejected by the Court I believe in Frontiero case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.786" offset="4834513">They indicated also that the son needs a good education or training.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.278" offset="4864502">I submit that the daughter also needs one and also the classic argument that girls tend to mature earlier than boys which again is one of the arguments made in some of the previous cases, particularly Reed against Reed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.949" offset="4931166">I think in that case, the Idaho Supreme Court sought to rationalize its statute on the basis that men were more qualified to be personal representatives than women were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.268" offset="4992397">And the fourth rationalization of the Court was that girls tend to marry earlier which is not a rationalization at all because you can't tell which is cause and which is effect, whether the fact that they marry earlier comes from the fact that they may be denied the support that is given to the male children.</text>

            <text syncTime="1276.508" offset="5209422">Now, tying to find the legislative rationalization for a statute like this is difficult because the Utah legislature has approached this various things differently with respect to the ages at which male children and female children reach the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.700" offset="5306180">For instance, in other legislation and in constitutional provisions of Utah, males and females at the same ages have the right to vote and hold office, the right to serve as jurors, the right to practice law, and make dispositions of properties by will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.875" offset="5414849">Theyre both subject to juvenile court jurisdiction at the same ages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.037" offset="5435538">Automobile licensing, the general duty of support set out in the general support statute and to public assistance under the public assistance program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.188" offset="5484126">I point these out primarily to suggest that there is no rational basis in the total legislative scheme that suggests a view on the part of the legislature that the female children are more competent at a particular age than the males.</text>

            <text syncTime="1405.542" offset="5725497">I would like to say this about the cases together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.093" offset="5743783">I've tried to find if I could a common thread in them and I think the one common thread I can find is that the surmises and the speculations with respect to legislative intention and some of the deference paid to the judgments of the legislature has been subjected to a closer look that even in the cases in which the Court has upheld the sex-based discrimination or the sex-based classification I should say, it has taken a look at the basis on which the statute is sought to be upheld and has made a careful analysis of what the state is trying to accomplish and the methods by which is doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.601" offset="5973765">I think that would be true of the -- not only of Kahn versus Shevin, but of the Geduldig versus Aiello and also Schlesinger versus Ballard in cases where the sex-based classification has been upheld or at least the classification which is contended to be sex-based.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.717" offset="6094242">Now, we have in this case too as we have -- the Court has had before in a number of others that we dont have any legislative history that gives any guidance as to what the legislature had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.959" offset="6167176">There are couple of points that have been raised in the briefs with respect to the standing for instance of the plaintiff here to bring this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.116" offset="6219839">A recent Utah case is reaffirmed what I pointed out earlier and that is that the parent who has paid the support money is the one who or has supported the child is the one who has the right to receive the support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.064" offset="6287653">That recent case was decided in October of last year, it's Baggs versus Anderson in 528 P. 2d 141, that was since the briefs were filed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.804" offset="6342614">Moreover, the Court here has held that the one challenging statute need not necessarily be a member of the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.743" offset="6390366">The most recent one I believe involving the woman jurors and their need to request jury service in Taylor versus Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.608" offset="6441775">The question of mootness has been raised and being contended that the daughters now over the age of 21 years and so that the question is moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.061" offset="6483571">However, the plaintiff in this case still has a question of her right to $2,700.00 riding on the outcome which would seem not to make the case moot.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.542" offset="6585553">The Court has the language of the very statute which is being challenged here and might just state briefly the language is that the period of minority extends in males to the age of 21 years and in females to that of 18 years but all minors obtain the majority by marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.674" offset="6642082">I think that there are four critical elements or four critical problems with the appellants case here, a couple of which had been touched on in the questions asked to counsel in his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.566" offset="6685654">I think first, as this Court is well aware, the appellant here is not in any representative capacity on behalf of her daughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.583" offset="6717733">She is here in her own right alleging that the statute in fact discriminates against her as a class, that being the class of mothers of daughters in the 18 to 21 age group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.318" offset="6764648">I submit that at this juncture she has no standing as in fact not only is she admittedly not a member of the class which the statute is designed to affect that is persons attaining majority, but she is indeed not even a member of the class which she claims as being discriminated against as in fact the daughter in question here turned 21 over a year ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="1724.216" offset="7000273">I would however submit that even if the Court finds that she has established her right which is in jeopardy here or has established that she will sustain a substantial injury that she is estopped to now claim, make that claim as the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.800" offset="7070595">And the record establishes without question the decree of divorce entered in this matter in November of 1960 was in fact a stipulated decree of divorce and a consent decree was entered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1775.830" offset="7206640">Under the statute here challenged, she the appellant may have contracted otherwise but chose not to do so and this Court has long recognized the doctrine of equitable estoppel and I submit that here, the appellant is estopped to assert that argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1840.338" offset="7464730">The defect number one of the statute that is claimed in any event has long since been cured by as counsel stated the adoption by Utah of the Uniform Civil Support Act -- Liability for Support Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.778" offset="7518438">That was adopted in 1957 and requires not only fathers but mothers to give support in appropriate circumstances to their children until they arrive at the age of 21.</text>

            <text syncTime="1979.874" offset="8022915">In any event, there are two other bills pending which would seek to make the age of majority uniform, one of which would make the age of majority 21 uniformly and the other 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.721" offset="8070248">But in any event, while these matters are pending before the Utah State legislature it seems to me that this acknowledgment of the political nature of this type of question was appropriately referred to by Mr. Justice Powell in his concurring opinion of Frontiero.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.960" offset="8135241">The Equal Rights Amendment which if adopted will resolve the substance to this precise question -- excuse me has been approved by the Congress and submitted for ratification by the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="2025.636" offset="8205876">By acting prematurely and unnecessarily as I view it, the Court has assumed the decisional responsibility at the very time when state legislature is functioning within the traditional democratic process, are debating the proposed amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.614" offset="8261778">It seems to me that by reaching out to preempt by judicial action a major political decision which is currently in process of resolution does not reflect appropriate respect for the duty proscribe legislative processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.973" offset="8319248">In addition, I would submit that the recent, most recent cases by this Court dealing with the so-called sex-based discrimination matters would provide that there in fact is a rational basis for the substantiation of this statute here under question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.763" offset="8390405">That in fact the courts in Kahn versus Shevin, this Court, Geduldig versus Aiello and Schlesinger versus Ballard case has stated that the courts will not or should not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of the legislature if there is a fair and substantial relation to the legislative objective to be sought or to be advanced the statute will stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.137" offset="8499911">In this particular instance, I submit that the state objective to be established or to be sought is to pinpoint an objectively identifiable point in time when a member of society is given the responsibilities and benefits of adulthood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.256" offset="8560410">It is to set an age at which the disabilities of infancy are removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.874" offset="8574830">The Utah legislature has made the determination that certain segments of the society are more capable of coping with these rights and responsibilities, namely married persons and females over the age of 18 and males over 21 and a view has traditional has been, correct or not, that a woman and matures emotionally and physically at an earlier age than men.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.495" offset="8657377">This statute is merely the codification of that traditional view and I submit that it does provide a fair and substantial means to promote a state objective and for that -- those reasons I submit the statute must be sustained</text>

            <text syncTime="2164.162" offset="8759986">The decisions just werent that clear prior to this case as to whether the support obligation ended at age 18 following the enactment of the Support Act and there were very -- I did not really find any decisions even prior to that in which there was a clear holding as to the age at which it ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.198" offset="8864162">But it was the argument we made to the Utah Supreme Court with respect to that was that the support money payment ended at majority, at common law because thats when the duty of a parent to support ended, and when the legislature changed that, then it was a rational basis for changing the application to the divorce proceedings.</text>
