            <label>Mr. William L. Patton</label>
            <text syncTime="44.378" offset="280848">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.277" offset="292446">This is one of four cases that will be argued today concerning issues related to this Court's decision in Almeida-Sanchez against the United States decided June 21, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.456" offset="345213">In Almeida-Sanchez, this Court held that warrantless searches of automobiles for concealed illegal aliens conducted without probable cause by border patrol agents on roving patrol violated the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.480" offset="413341">Each of these cases is here on writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.339" offset="436746">The questions presented in Ortiz and Bowen, Nos. 73-2050 and 73-6848, are whether Almeida-Sanchez should be extended to searches conducted at fixed check points and, if so, whether the extension should apply to searches conducted before the Ninth Circuit's decision in United States against Bowen.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.815" offset="534653">The question presented in Brignoni-Ponce, No. 74-114, is whether the warrantless stop of an automobile by border patrol officers violates the Fourth Amendment and requires the suppression of evidence obtained as a result of the stop but without any subsequent search.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.110" offset="611767">The sole issue presented in this case, United States against Peltier, No. 73-2000, is whether Almeida-Sanchez should be given retroactive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.309" offset="656593">The prior proceedings of this case are set forth in detail in our brief and I will only briefly summarize them here.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.123" offset="683865">On March 7, 1973, respondent was indicted for possession of approximately 270 lbs. of marijuana with intent to distribute in violation of Title 21 of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.103" offset="743737">He filed a motion to suppress the marijuana, claiming that the search of his automobile had violated the Fourth Amendment and that motion was denied after a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.105" offset="783757">The evidence showed that on February 28, 1973, at approximately 2:30 in the morning, the respondent's automobile was stopped by border patrol agents on roving patrol near Temecula, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.568" offset="837674">The stop occurred on Highway 395 at a point of approximately 70 air-miles north of the Mexican border.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.547" offset="869543">The agents testified that they had stopped the respondent's car because he was driving an old-modeled car and because he appeared to be a Mexican man.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.078" offset="907682">At the agent's request, the trunk was opened to permit them to inspect the presence of concealed illegal aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.956" offset="939238">Although no aliens were discovered, the agents did find 270 lbs. of marijuana in plastic bags in the trunk of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.611" offset="977795">The respondent was tried on stipulated facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.604" offset="989811">He stipulated, among other things, that he possessed the marijuana with intent to distribute, and the stipulation contained a proviso that it would not have been entered into if his motion to suppress had been granted and he reserves his right to appeal the question “suppression motion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="237.850" offset="1054804">The District Court found the respondent guilty and sentenced him to prison term of one year and one day subject to immediate parole eligibility and to special parole term of two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.663" offset="1098062">The Court of Appeals sitting and back, by a 7-6 vote, reversed the conviction and remanded to the District Court with instructions to suppress the marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.209" offset="1140172">We conceded in the Court of Appeals that the search of respondent's automobile was invalid under this Court's decision in Almeida-Sanchez, but we urge there as we urge here that Almeida-Sanchez should not be given retroactive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.534" offset="1205478">The majority in the Court of Appeals held that it need not reach the retroactivity issue because, in its view, Almeida-Sanchez did not establish a new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.471" offset="1249259">The majority concede that numerous since its decision, since 1961, had contained language from which the government would infer that the Court would uphold a roving patrol search, but the majority distinguished this language as dicta apparently on the ground that many of these cases involve checked point searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.942" offset="1331179">The majority also conceded that, in 1970, it had upheld the roving patrol search in its decision in United States against Miranda and again in Almeida-Sanchez itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.141" offset="1379976">It also noted that the Tenth Circuit had uphold-- upheld a roving patrol search in Roa-Rodriguez, but the majority said these decisions enjoyed only a brief acceptance.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.353" offset="1428773">The decision of the Ninth Circuit is in conflict with United States against Miller, a decision of the Fifth Circuit which is pending before this Court on a petition for writ of certiorari in No. 73-6975.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.336" offset="1488750">The Ninth Circuit also reached the opposite result in United States against Bowen.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.874" offset="1514872">The only difference between Bowen and this case is that Bowen involved the checkpoint search and, there, the majority, again by a 7-6 vote, founded Almeida-Sanchez had overruled clear past precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.763" offset="1566386">The Tenth Circuit has given Almeida-Sanchez retroactive effect in the case of checkpoint searches and, presumably, it would give a retroactive effect in the case of roving patrol searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.901" offset="1618944">We submit that Almeida-Sanchez did, indeed, establish a new rule that overruled past Court of Appeals precedent and a long-established practice and-- that under principles of this Court's retroactivity decisions and other principles of exclusionary rule policy itself, Almeida-Sanchez should not be given retroactive effect, that is it should not apply to searches conducted before June 21, 1973, the date on which it was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.128" offset="1743914">Support for roving patrol searches prior to Almeida-Sanchez was both judicial and statutory.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.257" offset="1772440">Section 1357 of Title 8 authorized Immigration and Naturalization Service officers without a warrant, within a reasonable distance from any external border of the United States, to board and search any vehicle or conveyance for illegal aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.301" offset="1852583">In regulations promulgate under the statute, the Attorney General had defined a reasonable distance from the border to be any point within 100 air-miles from an external boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.736" offset="1902320">And, we believe that the statute alone, in the absence of a contrary judicial construction, would be sufficient basis for reliance by law enforcement officers and would present a retroactivity question and, that, we believe is the thrust of this Court's plurality opinion in Lemon against Kurtzman, declining to give retroactive effect to its prior decision holding a Pennsylvania statute unconstitutional that provided public aid to non-public sectarian schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.764" offset="2026454">But, we do not rely on the statute alone because the unconstitutionality of the statute was upheld in numerous decisions in the Fifth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.030" offset="2071489">The Ninth Circuit distinguished many of these cases as dicta, as I said, presumably on the ground that they involved checkpoint searches, but the language in those decisions was not so limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.797" offset="2126555">And, prior to Almeida-Sanchez, there was no distinction drawn in the case law between checkpoint searches and roving patrol searches, and the majority of the Ninth Circuit conceded that its cases contained language from which the government might infer that roving patrol searches would be upheld and that, of course, is precisely what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.464" offset="2213177">The Ninth Circuit upheld roving patrol searches in Miranda and Almeida-Sanchez, the Tenth Circuit in its decision in United States against Roa-Rodriguez, and the Fifth Circuit in its decision in United States against Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.788" offset="2270542">Mr. Justice Powell's concurring opinion in Almeida-Sanchez recognized this consistent judicial approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.769" offset="2298441">He wrote the roving automobile searches in border regions for aliens had been consistently approved by the judiciary, and Mr. Justice White's dissenting opinion also recognized this prior judicial approval for he observed that the Courts have consistently and almost without dissent come to the same conclusion that is embodied in the judgment that is reversed today.Respondent himself recognized, at the time of his suppression motion, that the state of the law sustained roving patrol stops and searches for concealed illegal aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.621" offset="2449847">In the District Court, he contended that while it was permissible to stop and search for aliens, once border patrol agents discovered no illegal aliens, they then were required to go no further even though they observed the marijuana in the trunk of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.246" offset="2524348">For example, at page 23 of the appendix, respondent's counsel say to the Court “now, if Agent Ansco had felt the bag to see if there was an alien in there, I would say, fine, we do not have an illegal search and seizure.”</text>
            <text syncTime="621.857" offset="2590804">Respondent did ask that his case be stayed pending this Court's decision in Almeida-Sanchez, but that is simply recognition that he needed a change in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.474" offset="2637302">The only additional factors which could be required are either a prior decision by Court or additional Court of Appeals opinions, but neither requirement is sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.250" offset="2688397">There is no support in this Court's decisions for the proposition that a decision must overrule a prior precedent of this Court before a retroactivity issue is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.700" offset="2738134">In Chevron Oil against Huson, for example, this Court declined to give retroactive effect to Rodriguez against setting a casualty even though Rodriguez had overruled only a long line of Fifth Circuit opinions.</text>

            <text syncTime="688.059" offset="2855581">But in Linkletter, Mr. Justice Stewart, this Court indicated that it saw no difference between civil and criminal cases for purposes of retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.326" offset="2892675">I think-- we believe that the majority opinion in Bowen in the Ninth Circuit is the correct analysis on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.730" offset="2926320">Every issue cannot be brought to this Court and, by necessity, a number of important issues of law enforcement must be litigated in the Courts of Appeals.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="713.436" stopTime="718.985">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="713.436" offset="2957145">This issue was brought this Court a few many years ago in Carroll against the United States.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_l_patton" startTime="718.985" stopTime="902.756">
            <label>Mr. William L. Patton</label>
            <text syncTime="718.985" offset="2979297">Well, we disagree about that, Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.222" offset="2988283">We believe that it's true, this Court's opinion in Almeida-Sanchez relied on prior Fourth Amendment precedent, but there was an intervening federal statute which we believe the law enforcement officers were entitled to rely on until Courts declared otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.795" offset="3058604">And, this issue was litigated in the Courts of Appeals for the Fifth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits and the government never lost the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.333" offset="3092668">Now, we rely on this Court's opinion in Lemon against Kurtzman that statutory or even judge-made rules of law are hard facts on which people must rely in making decisions and in shaping their conduct, and that's exactly what the border patrol did.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.672" offset="3158079">Roving patrols were extensively used in the Mexican border area prior to Almeida-Sanchez.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.268" offset="3180440">For example, we are informed that in fiscal year 1972, approximately 240,000 man-hours were devoted to highway surveillance of roving patrol searches-- roving patrol activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.451" offset="3237177">We believe that Almeida-Sanchez did establish a new rule, that it was a clear break with the past and, under this Court's retroactivity decisions and under exclusionary rule policy itself, it should not be given retroactive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.442" offset="3289109">This Court's decisions have established three tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.082" offset="3303737">The first and most important of those is the purpose of the rule itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.804" offset="3322546">And, uniformly, this Court's decisions involving the exclusionary rule had declined to give exclusionary rule decisions retroactive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.400" offset="3356923">Whether the rule, as viewed as directed at conforming police conduct or addendicating the right of privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment, in either case, there is no effect on the integrity of the fact finding process and neither purpose is advanced by retroactive application.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.136" offset="3431946">The second two-test, the extent of reliance by law enforcement officers and the disruption of the administration of justice that would result from retroactive application, are looked to only when the first-- when the purpose of the rule is neutral as to retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.844" offset="3498715">As we've indicated, that purpose is not neutral but, looking to those tests, there was widespread reliance on the authority to conduct roving patrol searches and, as for disruption, there are approximately 40 cases in the Courts of Appeal that involve Almeida-Sanchez roving patrol issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.763" offset="3562454">There are an indeterminate number of cases in the District Courts and, of course, there would be a large number of cases affected in collateral attack proceedings if Almeida-Sanchez were given retroactive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.019" offset="3635493">So, for all of these reasons, we submit that Almeida-Sanchez should not be applied to searches conducted before the date that it was decided and we submit that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="912.280" offset="3752521">The main question that we're confronted with here is whether or not Almeida-Sanchez should be applied retroactively or prospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.037" offset="3787525">However, before we should even approach that question, we must realize that the issue of retroactive-- retroactivity only applies to a new constitutional rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1066.376" offset="4368906">No, I am suggesting that the attorneys that wrote the statute for the government were perfectly aware of the problem and, where aware of it, they were treading on, so to speak, thin ice in regard to this but saw this was a viable alternative and that they may step forward and take their chances until the question is presented to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.050" offset="4479561">It was submitted that this Court's decision in Almeida-Sanchez overruled past precedent. However, the test is clear past precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.487" offset="4521357">We do not feel that one case prior to Almeida-Sanchez allowing a roving patrol to stop and search a car without probable cause or even reasonable suspicion that a criminal activity was at foot establishes clear past precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.511" offset="4593455">As a matter of fact, the Ninth Circuit has held, with the exception of United States versus Almeida-Sanchez, that all other cases that ever addressed themselves to that issue required either probable cause to believe that the vehicle had contraband or illegal aliens, or that there was a reasonable certainty existed that contraband was aboard the vehicle at the time it entered the United States, or a reasonable certainty that the vehicle contained aliens or goods which had been smuggled into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.429" offset="4717066">This is the Ninth Circuit's own recognition of their prior case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.033" offset="4739532">Contrary to the Ninth Circuit, the Tenth Circuit and the Fifth Circuit have uniformly required reasonable or founded suspicion to stop a search prior to this court's decision in Almeida-Sanchez.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.322" offset="4784671">It would appear, therefore, that the Ninth Circuit is the only Court and that United States versus Almeida-Sanchez and United States versus Miranda are the only cases which held that the border patrol can make a roving stop and search of a vehicle without probable cause or founded suspicion or even any recognition of Fourth Amendment rights under the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.184" offset="4892087">On this basis, I feel that it can be hardly argued that this Court's decision in Almeida-Sanchez overruled clear past precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.995" offset="4943391">The second test is did this Court's decision overrule a practice long-accepted and widely relied upon?</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.558" offset="4973589">As I have pointed out, I feel that the reliance must be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.373" offset="4988844">I do not think that the-- that illegal governmental activity should be allowed to establish constitutional precedent no matter how long it has been relied upon, and this is exactly what the government is asking to occur in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.541" offset="5057494">The government is relied on Section 1357 (a) 3 on its literal interpretation which is completely devoid of the Fourth Amendment to the constitution and it is unreasonable, in light of the fact that prior decisions of Circuit Courts have held that the same statute of a prior code section, 1357 (a) 1, applied the Fourth Amendment reasonable suspicion standard to interrogate an alien, and that was in the case of Au Yi Lau versus the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.741" offset="5198346">Likewise, Section 1357 (a) 2 applied the Fourth Amendment probable cause to arrest an alien, and Yam Sang Kwai, another Circuit Court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.808" offset="5246621">On that basis, I feel that it is unreasonable to hold that the first two sections of the Act require recognition of the Fourth Amendment where the third section of the Act can be read completely devoid of the constitutional requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.017" offset="5307434">Likewise, I feel that the governmental reliance on the statute was unreasonable in light of the history of the immigration laws which have been set out in the Brignoni-Ponce brief of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.867" offset="5346826">All prior statutes recognize Fourth Amendment requirements even in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.475" offset="5377233">Furthermore, the small number of cases which have even addressed themselves to the roving search show that there was very little reliance upon this practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.455" offset="5425194">Therefore, it can hardly be said that this Court's decision in Almeida-Sanchez overruled the practice which was long-accepted and widely relied upon as one of the requirements to determine whether a new constitutional rule has been established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.541" offset="5477543">On that basis, it is submitted that Almeida-Sanchez did not establish a new constitutional rule, but merely reaffirmed the long line of decisions which have followed Carroll v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.305" offset="5524564">To hold that Almeida-Sanchez establishes a new exclusionary rule based solely on governmental reliance would be to hold that the government can establish constitutional precedent by its illegal unilateral activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.022" offset="5587466">The third test is set out in Chevron Oil versus Huson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.290" offset="5608573">Well, it's whether or not Almeida-Sanchez decided an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.241" offset="5644309">The Chevron Oil case held that respondent can only rely on the law as it then was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.057" offset="5671581">So, he must look at the laws that then was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.063" offset="5683597">The Fifth Circuit had determined that a roving check always required at least reasonable or founded suspicion and recognize application of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.882" offset="5730931">The Ninth Circuit and Tenth Circuit, since this Court's decision in Almeida-Sanchez have stated that a roving check always require probable cause, they'd find this-- they'd achieve this conclusion by determining that this Court's decision in Almeida-Sanchez did not state a new rule, but merely reaffirmed Carroll versus the United States and, on that basis, that has always been the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.832" offset="5854751">Based on the Chevron Oil case which held that respondent can only rely on the law as it then was, it is submitted that Paltier can only rely on the law as it then was, and it has been determined that the law as it then was required probable cause to stop and search a vehicle by a roving border patrol.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.001" offset="5943359">Even applying the straight reasonableness test as set out in the dissent in Almeida-Sanchez, Peltier, unlike Almeida-Sanchez, lacked reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.448" offset="5997171">By comparison, the highway where Almeida-Sanchez was apprehended came directly from the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.146" offset="6027995">In Peltier, the highway upon which he was apprehended began in downtown San Diego and is one of the main-- three major roads leading out of Southern California.</text>

            <text syncTime="2346.435" offset="9489115">Well, it's pointed out in the government's case in Bowen, on page 11 note 6, that if a party prevails in a lower decision, they can bring up any basis or any ground upon which to additionally make a determination on that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.403" offset="9568946">The issue of reasonableness has been maintained from the Trial Court level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.639" offset="9593919">I wish to also point out that all Circuit Courts who have ever addressed themselves to this issue, that is the Fifth, the Ninth, and the Tenth, would obtain the exact same result in Pelteir as the Ninth had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.558" offset="9657553">And, the Ninth and the Tenth Circuits hold that the law now, after Almeida-Sanchez, always required probable cause to search on a roving patrol.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.673" offset="9706036">Wherein, Almeida-Sanchez reaffirmed the rule of Carroll versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.151" offset="9724008">So, on that basis, the Ninth Circuit has held that lacking probable cause, lacking recognition of the Fourth Amendment that Pelteir, like Almeida-Sanchez, should have the evidence suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.882" offset="9778866">Now, the Fifth Circuit has always required, now this is pre-Almeida-Sanchez, have always required at least a founded or reasonable suspicion and, since June 25-- or since June 21, 1973, it required probable cause, but even the Fifth Circuit on pre-Almeida-Sanchez law would have suppressed the evidence in Peltier because it did not even comport to the founded or reasonable suspicion requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.895" offset="9903000">Therefore, lacking probable cause or even if founded or reasonable suspicion, all the Circuits would've dismissed Peltier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.567" offset="9941661">The government, in this situation, attempted to apply a statute, completely devoid of the Fourth Amendment requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.112" offset="9971858">Now, the Ninth Circuit, for a period of time, went along with the Immigration and Nationality Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.851" offset="10010728">However, the Fifth Circuit, at all times, refused to go along with recognizing-- or without recognizing the Fourth Amendment at all, and they attempted to carve an exception to Carroll versus the United States by requiring a founded suspicion and applying, therefore, a minimal Fourth Amendment recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.551" offset="10093589">Now, to agree with the Fifth Circuit would be to allow all Circuit Courts to establish their own constitutional exceptions until overturned by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.962" offset="10127235">I feel that to so do that would create chaos in the lower Court decisions giving them authority to carve exceptions to rules established by this Court and justify those exceptions until the issue is brought to this Court and reviewed and overturned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.422" offset="10201109">Constitutional rule should begin with the Supreme Court and they should end with the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.823" offset="10218663">And, as occurred in the case of Carroll versus United States and reaffirmed by Almeida-Sanchez, Peltier's case should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2543.579" offset="10277700">Mr. Chief Justice, I just like to make a few quick remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.549" offset="10297553">First of all, we're not talking about the government's unilateral conduct establishing a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.207" offset="10324198">There was a federal statute that had been construed in all of the Circuits that encompassed jurisdictions bordering on the Republic of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.203" offset="10368188">We disagree with respondent's analysis of the decisions of the Fifth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits and we say it is simply not true that there is any requirement of probable cause for immigration searches prior to Almeida-Sanchez.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.643" offset="10425971">The Fumagalli decision in the Ninth Circuit, which is discussed in Justice White's dissenting opinion in Almeida-Sanchez, is representative of the Ninth Circuit decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.819" offset="10466617">They drew a distinction between contraband searches for which they required probable cause and immigration searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.771" offset="10490441">In immigration searches relying on the statute, they did not require probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.573" offset="10521684">The same is true with the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.401" offset="10528998">If you look at the Miller decisions and the Wright decision which is cited in our brief, you will see that what the Fifth Circuit said is that the test is where the search is reasonable under the circumstances, but it was not probable cause or reasonable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.078" offset="10595662">If it was, it was no more than a requirement that border patrol officers search only compartments large enough to conceal illegal aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.434" offset="10641115">And, as to the reasonableness issue which respondent has brought up in his argument, I don't believe that was raised in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.037" offset="10671522">Unfortunately, I don't have the briefs here, and I don't think it should be considered now but, in any event, under the prior law--</text>

            <text syncTime="2720.349" offset="10984782">Well, Mr. Justice White, at Temecula, where this search was conducted, we did operate a checkpoint there for a period in 1974 under an area warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.246" offset="11036400">Unfortunately, in October of 1974, the District Court in the Central District of California refused to renew the warrant on the ground that it lacked the authority to give an area warrant.</text>
