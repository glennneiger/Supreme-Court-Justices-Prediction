            <text syncTime="40.398" offset="264965">Mr. Chief Justice Burger.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.845" offset="274787">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.063" offset="291610">This case involves a $500 fine from a Texas District Court and, in that context, it is obviously not an important case and that is obviously not why this Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.343" offset="364753">The importance of this case is that it involves the very independence of the American Bar to give free untrammeled legal advice to a client who has the right, should he choose to do so, to follow it or disregard it.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.180" offset="460048">Now, I think perhaps I should make it clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.350" offset="472795">I think it's been made clear in the briefs and I know the Court has seen them.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.340" offset="488782">There is no allegation or suggestion or suspicion that Mr. Maness, who is a member of the Bar of this Court and of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and, of course, the Texas Supreme Court and so on, was in any way contumacious in any personal sense to the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.171" offset="580106">Actually, there were three lawyers involved in this case, a Mr. Friedman who is unfortunately now deceased and a Mr. Maley who may presently be in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.702" offset="622216">I don't know whether he is, but three lawyers gave sincere legal advice that this particular client did not have to produce certain documents which, the state contended, were incriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.060" offset="695568">And, it is simply a case of a lawyer being punished for giving advice on a federal constitutional right, and that's what this case is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.756" offset="750425">Now, we have had a tradition in this country, since certainly Adams represented the British Soldiers in the Boston Massacre, of lawyers at least being allowed to represent and advice their clients and that tradition is about to be destroyed if this contempt citation stands up, and that is the importance of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.586" offset="853765">Fortunately, it has-- had already been decided once.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.410" offset="876962">I think perhaps the value of my presentation to you is perhaps in discussing the facts rather than the law because the law has been completely discussed in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.105" offset="951777">As a matter of fact, the case has already been decided by the United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.686" offset="974137">If you will examine appendix C in our brief on the merits, beginning at page 74, you will find the opinion of Judge Roberts in Austin dealing with Mr. Maley who was co-counsel in the case and it's a white horse situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.779" offset="1062536">There's no difference between the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.493" offset="1069328">It simply was a choice of remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="404.290" offset="1720508">This Court has before it, either having granted certiorari or applications for certiorari, some-26 cases involving pornography and obscenity, and I think for a lawyer in the middle of a trial when this Court itself has had considerable difficulties through the years in determining the limits and bound of what is right and what is proper, with this Court having some-26 cases before it right now, for a lawyer working in a Texas town to do anything except suggest to a client that he ought to exercise his rights against self-incrimination I think would probably be negligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="533.314" offset="2236583">Mr. McKelva having received his advice from his three lawyers, Mr. McKelva had the right to disregard the Court's order and, thereby, be put in jail for contempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="550.977" offset="2307323">In this case, it was tested by habeas corpus. Judge Roberts issued a writ for Mr. McKelva and, the minute the state judge learned that the Federal Court had entertained and granted the writ to bring him into the Federal Court, the state judge called Mr. McKelva over from the county jail and said “I'm going to let you go.</text>
