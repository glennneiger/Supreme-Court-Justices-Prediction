            <text syncTime="17.912" offset="71576">In Schlesinger, the case comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.121" offset="96444">It involves the relationship between the federal civilian courts and the military court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.581" offset="126224">Respondent, an Army Captain was charged with marijuana offenses committed while off duty and off base.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.532" offset="166034">He obtained a federal court injunction against his being tried by military court martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.651" offset="194560">The Court of Appeals finding that the marijuana offenses were not service connected held that a military court lack jurisdiction to try them.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.386" offset="241476">Accordingly, it sustained the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.309" offset="257149">We agreed to review the case to resolve conflicting views as to respective powers and responsibilities of Article 3 civilian courts as compared with those of military courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.286" offset="333113">Although we conclude that the District Court did have subject matter jurisdiction, we think for reasons stated in the opinion that there was no occasion in this case for the exercise of that jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.344" offset="393300">The system of military courts was established by the Congress which recognized that the military is a specialized society separate from civilian society with laws and traditions of its own developed during a long history.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.774" offset="471040">Strong considerations of policy including the expertise of the military courts favor exhaustion of remedies within that system before it resort to review our collateral attack in civilian courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.272" offset="537078">We find nothing in the circumstances of this case that justified injunctive action by the civilian courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.206" offset="572813">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.086" offset="588278">The Chief Justice filed a separate statement concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.217" offset="608862">Mr. Justice Douglas, Mr. Justice Brennan, and Mr. Justice Marshall concurred in part and dissented in part.</text>
