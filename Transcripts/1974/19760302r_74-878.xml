            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">We will hear arguments next in National League of Cities against Usery, and California against Usery.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.028" offset="60082">Governor Rampton.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="calvin_l_rampton" startTime="16.990" stopTime="526.120">
            <label>Mr. Calvin L. Rampton</label>
            <text syncTime="16.990" offset="67918">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.974" offset="83801">I am participating in the argument, re-argument of this case today, even though I did not participate in the first argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.116" offset="116402">Not in the hope that I can add any legal expertise to our Chief Council Mr. Rhyne but because my fellow Governors of the 50 States desire that I express their deep concern for this Court, in regard to the Fair Labor Standard Act Amendments of 1974, concern not only for the immediate effect that will have on the operation of state and local government, but also on the fact that we feel this is another step forward toward wiping out state sovereignty and perhaps a near retrievable step.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.384" offset="317440">In this case, there appears to be a great deal of argument of fact based upon no evidence, because of course the case though it no evidence presented below, and yet there have been assertions made by brief on both sides as to the effect of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.036" offset="396121">The Solicitor General asserts that as a basis for the need for Congress to extend the provision to the Fair Labor Act to state and local government, that there were some 95,000 employees in the United States, state and local government that were being payed less than the minimum wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.430" offset="497685">The same token I will say I doubt very much that that is so, I have done survey in my own state, and there are none.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.227" offset="532898">Also, the appellants have made certain allegations regarding the cost of the application of these rules to state and local government.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.780" offset="595069">Here again, I doubt if we were in a Trial Court that the evidence would stand out.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.098" offset="632372">But this much I think must be true and it appears to me that the Solicitor General is in sort of in a dilemma’ here.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.269" offset="664973">On the one hand, he alleges that there is a great problem to cure the 95,000 people that are below minimum wage and on the other hand, that he is not going to put a burden on state and local government to cure it.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.414" offset="729652">As whatever the problem is, it is a problem that has got to be cured by money, and the cost of the cure is going to be commensurate with the size of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.916" offset="775628">And if it is a big problem, as he attempts to assert as indeed he must, if he is to prevail here, if there is a big problem then the money required from state and local government committed is indeed going to put a burden on the budgets of those units of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.006" offset="875938">Most of the states provide for over time for their employees up to a certain level, generally above a given salary level or a given salary classification in the pay scale and provides for compensatory time-off.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.538" offset="962142">However, in my opinion it would not be difficult in regard to apportion of state government to change to comply with these rules, to pay the time and half or overtime, because you could then do as many Governors have said, “Alright we will do this but from now on there will be no overtime.”</text>
            <text syncTime="266.770" offset="1067050">Over in regard to a certain classification of employees, those engaged in public safety, there is no way that you can conform to an eight-hour day or a forty-hour week.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.932" offset="1135700">And if they are to perform the functions, which is their duty to perform, even though the Act and the regulations under the Act, make some modification to the requirements to fireman and policeman, they cannot and should not be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.512" offset="1209992">Congress has not attempted to bring the Armed Services, that is the military personnel except for civilian employees under the provisions of these acts and yet there is not a fire department, a police department, or a highway patrol in this country that does not have to operate fairly well under military rules, and where there is an emergency in the forty-hour week or the fifty-seven hour week, rings the bell on you, but they cannot quit and go home, do the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.606" offset="1346351">So it is not within the power of the state governments to comply in full and avoid the impact of these new orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.262" offset="1397029">The forty-hour week will, in my opinion, bear much more heavily on cities and counties than it will on state governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.810" offset="1439138">But all of the Governors feel a responsibility to the subsidiary units of governments within their states because they are creatures of the state legislature; the legislature has got to give them the power and authority to render the services that they are charged with rendering.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.763" offset="1514998">So as a Governor, I feel equally responsible for units of local government and their budgets and their ability to render the services I do for the state government itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.241" offset="1568914">In most states and in most larger cities, the supervision of employee-relationship is under a merit system council.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.462" offset="1617816">By this provision, these Amendments, the merit system council for state and local government would be first, the Department of Labor and secondly, Mr. Chief Justice, as you are mentioning this morning the 425 Federal Courts in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.885" offset="1715513">Already these Courts are overloaded, and new judges are necessary, and here is a knack which would throw a new burden on them, a much greater burden than was thrown on them by Wirtz.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.205" offset="1768803">Because in the case of Wirtz, we were able to -- or the cities and counties and the states were able to adjust reasonably well so that most of the cases that had gone into a Federal Courts, pursuant to the Wirtz case, were violations that occurred while Wirtz was pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.295" offset="1849156">But in this case, under the 1974 Amendments as I mentioned a few minutes ago, because you extend so much further and because you cannot conceivably comply because of emergency situations, the amount of litigation will be truly great.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.119" offset="1936405">The local merit system councils have been able through their acquaintanceship with local problems to keep labor disturbances within the states and cities and counties to a minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.419" offset="2009652">And there is no danger here, contrary to what the Congress found that strikes, which might be prevented by payment of the minimum wage, are going to place a burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.075" offset="2076212">However, the greatest fear I believe that I and my colleagues have, regarding these 1974 Amendments--</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="526.120" offset="2104424">Do you happen to know Governor, do most of the state have laws prohibiting strikes by public employees?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="calvin_l_rampton" startTime="534.317" stopTime="543.370">
            <label>Mr. Calvin L. Rampton</label>
            <text syncTime="534.317" offset="2137234">There are very few that permit them, many are silent on them, some have them, I could get a schedule of that and file it as a late brief but--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="543.370" stopTime="545.650">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>

            <label>Mr. Calvin L. Rampton</label>
            <text syncTime="545.650" offset="2182583">But in those states which do not specifically permit strikes by public employees, the Governors have taken the same position that was taken in 1924 by Governor Coolidge of Massachusetts, that you cannot strike against the public welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.785" offset="2267115">We believe that this case takes us a great deal further than Wirtz does, while I do not agree with Wirtz, I feel it is clearly distinguishable from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.135" offset="2324480">In the Wirtz case, you can base the jurisdiction solely on the competition theory because the activities of Government which were there covered by the early Amendments, all can conceivably be said to be in direct competition with firms in interstate commerce, not so under the ’74 Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.432" offset="2441718">You can uphold the ’74 Amendments and say, that the activities there covered are under the Interstate Commerce Act, only by the application of the enterprise theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.808" offset="2491141">I know you did discuss the enterprise theory in Wirtz and cite that that as one basis that the holding in Wirtz, but it is not necessary in the holding in Wirtz and that could be changed without overturning Wirtz.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.693" offset="2550700">But if the enterprise theory actually is to apply to states and local governments and go to its logical conclusion, then I think you have destroyed the sovereignty of states--</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="650.967" offset="2603781">It is your position that just as a matter of commerce power the federal government cannot reach these activities of the states, or is it that of course, it is within the commerce power but the commerce power is limited by some other considerations--</text>

            <label>Mr. Calvin L. Rampton</label>
            <text syncTime="669.161" offset="2676611">The commerce power is limited, it is my position, Mr. Justice White, that the attempt to apply the enterprise theory to local and state governments, is always applied to private concerns, but to attempt to apply it to local and state governments which would then bring under the Commerce Clause every single act that local and state government might make would effectively wipe-out the sovereignty of states.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="701.862" offset="2807432">That is a little bit different point, it is a sense of, there is some limitations and consideration that federalism put on the reach of the commerce power.</text>

          <turn speaker="calvin_l_rampton" startTime="710.153" stopTime="712.765">
            <label>Mr. Calvin L. Rampton</label>
            <text syncTime="710.153" offset="2840555">Yes, certainly, I would have said that that is true.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="712.765" offset="2851004">Rather than if some private industry was performing -- let us assume the states decided to form out its police job and have some independent contractors performing.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.596" offset="2922371">Would you suggest that the power would not reach it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="calvin_l_rampton" startTime="733.567" stopTime="824.234">
            <label>Mr. Calvin L. Rampton</label>
            <text syncTime="733.567" offset="2934178">I would suggest that no state would do that, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.117" offset="2956434">I think the difference is, to use the words of Chief Justice Burger when we argued this the last time, the things reached by Wirtz are activities that a state may do or may not do, I guess another way of saying these things that they do in their proprietary capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.473" offset="3029891">The things that are now reached under the 1974 Amendments are things that they must do if they are going to continue with the state, if they are going to continue to exercise the state police power, and therefore not only in terms of the people covered but in terms of the principle a giant step beyond Wirtz.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.932" offset="3107631">And from that step I can see no logical stopping point.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.672" offset="3122678">Right now there is pending before the Congress, bills that would extend to all provisions for the National Labor Relations Act to state, including the right requirements for negotiation, the requirement that locally officials -- locally elected officials submit to binding arbitration and giving employees the right strike and that was build or held up there only because of dependency of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.136" offset="3228526">Again, I repeat that I and my fellow Governors are concerned not only with the immediate effects of the 1974 Amendments or with the fact that it strikes down the last bar that prevents the intrusion of Congress on the power of the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="836.498" offset="3345972">In this case, I will argue that the 1974 Amendments to the Fair Labor Standard Act as they apply to states and cities and counties, which they do encompass all of their employees with minor exemptions are unconstitutional on two basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.928" offset="3459657">Number one, I am going to argue that the nexus to commerce is so insubstantial as not to warrant the validity of this Act under the commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.418" offset="3525590">But, Mr. Justice White, I would certainly, and with great vigor, urge that this Court’s decision in United States versus Fry, which I do not think touched this case at all, held that in any case where a federal statute impairs the ability of a state or city or county to function in a sovereign capacity, it comes up against constitutional federalism and is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.028" offset="3680026">First of all, let me address--</text>

            <text syncTime="924.010" offset="3696013">Sometime during your argument, will you address yourself to the question of whether the states are necessarily in the same position as the counties and the cities here.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.932" offset="3743660">Because as I see it there are two lines of authority, a county or a city acting is state action for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, but a county is not a state for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment, so I can conceive of there being some distinction made even if your argument were accepted.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_s_rhyne" startTime="956.539" stopTime="1006.882">
            <label>Mr. Charles S. Rhyne</label>
            <text syncTime="956.539" offset="3826103">Well, Your Honor, I would like to answer the question right now in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.084" offset="3848255">Of course cities and counties are creatures of the state, they take all of their powers from the state, and it is true that one county may perform 50 functions for its cities, and one city like Chicago may perform 5,000 functions because of their size, and that the state may perform, say a 1,000 different functions for the overall of the citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.774" offset="3971030">So, with respect to the Eleventh Amendment, it would be my contention that in the context of this Act, that the states and the cities and the counties are one.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="1006.882" offset="4027455">But if you are relying on the Eleventh Amendment, I think the law is rather clearly against you, because as Justice Marshal’s opinion in Moore against Alameda County just two or three years ago, reaffirmed the old holding of this Court that a county was not a state for purpose of the Eleventh Amendment.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles S. Rhyne</label>
            <text syncTime="1023.190" offset="4092656">Well, I say, I am not addressing myself to the Eleventh Amendment in the context of that particular action that was addressed there, I am talking about governmental functions that the county performs for the state, which I think are entirely different basis from the functions that were involved there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.719" offset="4174785">But addressing myself to the nexus to commerce, let us look at what the Congress thought was the nexus to commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.340" offset="4217313">First of all they said there was this famous 95,000 state, local and city employees who received a substandard wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.373" offset="4261407">From this time I have been in this litigation until now I have tried to find that 95,000 and still trying to find them and I say that even if they exist, where and who are they employed by, what county, what city, what state, they all deny that they have anyone who is paid less than the minimum wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.499" offset="4353985">But 95,000 out of 11,400,000 is a mighty small number, and so I say it is insignificant in the overall of the picture so that the substandard wage argument is no nexus to commerce as far as I am concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1114.187" offset="4456699">It originated evidently in some study done by the Labor Department where they made some kind of a survey of the nation, and they put out these surveys every month.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.976" offset="4523886">The latest one, for example is very interesting in connection with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.390" offset="4537469">for example, it shows that there are only 56,000,000 people for example, covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act, as compared to Fry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.490" offset="4573936">And when it comes to Fry, I address myself to that because there are 94,000,000 people, 94,000,000 workers and there are 56 of those covered by this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.283" offset="4621061">And when I mean covered that means a record like they have on Governor Rampton, not a regulation like they have on Fireman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.676" offset="4654602">But returning on my argument, which I think is very important, that there is not substantial evidence here of a nexus to commerce sufficient on which defined a rationale relation upon which to base this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.720" offset="4734851">The second, besides substandard wages, is labor strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.352" offset="4757316">Well let us look at labor strike, they cited, they do not say where it is in the Solicitor General’s brief so again we have to look at the statistics in his client’s own publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.040" offset="4808098">The latest in 1973 says that the three stoppages by public school teachers caused one-half of the 2.3 million days of government idleness in 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.646" offset="4870583">In 1973, employees of educational institutions, or institutions both teachers and support personnel were on strike more frequently than any category of government employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.029" offset="4924082">Now contrast that, contrast that with the very careful approach of Mr. Justice Harlan in the Wirtz case, where he specifically, specifically linked strikes and work stoppages involving employees of schools and hospitals of things that were covered there, see here the problem is you cover everybody, everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.441" offset="5029721">And but here Mr. Justice Harlan was quite careful and I am reading from 392 US 195, and he says strikes and work stoppages involving employees of schools and hospitals, events which unfortunately are not infrequent, obviously interrupt and burden the flow of goods across state lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.703" offset="5118746">It is therefore clear that a rationale basis exists for congressional prescribing minimum wage law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.150" offset="5144555">Now, I say there is no finding here that there was a strike by anyone of these 95,000 ghosted, impeded, or burdened interstate commerce in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.445" offset="5193770">You are talking about school teachers, and they are exempt?</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.859" offset="5211429">Now, so it goes then the appellee to purchasers and there he is talking about the minimal effect up to now, he says all this will have any effect on state and cities, 1% or less something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.084" offset="5272242">He balloons up and takes all the purchases by all of government, 134 billion dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.712" offset="5298782">He says that effects interstate commerce but he does not show in any way, as you have found in these other cases, as Mr. Justice Harlan found in Wirtz, that some of these 95,000 people who were paid too little were striking and burdening those purchases in any way in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.103" offset="5380389">So, I say the evidence before Congress was nonexistent, nonexistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.023" offset="5404003">And then he goes to unfair competition, what does he have for evidence? He has two ads in the New York Times, one New York asks for business to come there because they have low taxes, the other one Massachusetts asks business to come there because they have low taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.127" offset="5476415">And from that, he draws the conclusion that because they have low taxes they pay sub-minimal wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.034" offset="5504104">Well, baloney, I just used such a word in this obvious body but it is the truth, and so, unfair competition, the idea of a state engaging in unfair competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.961" offset="5559798">Now you did have competition in Wirtz and it was so found by Mr. Justice Harlan, but the thing that-- and then the next thing he does is talks about spreading employment, well this Court does not say this, one of you once said nine-months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.171" offset="5636598">You realize what is going on the world, if there is anything that is going on in the world it is that people in the public sector are losing their jobs for the thousands every day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.691" offset="5674736">And so here, where you increase the pay of a few, you caused the loss of jobs of millions, that is exactly what this Act does, and it refers to a less welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.391" offset="5729489">Well, I cannot in my wildest imagination link that up in anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.820" offset="5759269">So I come to the conclusion, may it please the Court, that the Act is bottomed on a false bottom insofar as its nexus to commerce is concerned, and I therefore urge that the Act be held unconstitutional on that bill alone, but I go again--</text>

            <text syncTime="1527.108" offset="6108369">And here, when you encompass the whole of the United States of America, the whole of Government, not only state and local government but all federal government, you cannot come to grips with it and I say they have not shown any nexus to commerce, such as has been required by this Court over and over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.679" offset="6198648">Now let me go to Fry, because I think Fry disposes this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.348" offset="6221322">I think that in Fry when this Court said, number one, words had a small affect or intrusion on government and Fry had even less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.022" offset="6292062">And then in the footnote, you resurrected from the dead, the Tenth Amendment, and said that if the functions of states and cities are impaired, are there policies interfered with so as to impair them that that would violate constitutional federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.906" offset="6379624">Well, look at what we have here, 85% of the budget of every city in this nation is personnel, 75% of the budget of every state is personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.496" offset="6441900">Now, what you are doing in this legislation is imposing down upon an existing civil service, that obviously, I think clearly is satisfying an awful lot of people because there was a trial below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.044" offset="6520163">And the testimony in that trial was that if there were long lines of people who wanted to get police jobs and long lines of people who wanted to get fireman’s job because of the fringe benefits that go with them, these are among the most desirable of all job, so was the testimony there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.833" offset="6591321">And states and cities do pay very-very high, they think wages, and I call attention to the fact that a man who earns $13,000 in Havre Montana is a pretty high-paid guy and his $13,000 is worth about $90,000 here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2649.384" offset="10597460">It is a Fifth Circuit decisions that they cite for you, it says it is ‘up-in, up-out.’</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.149" offset="10624522">It is not a 23 Rule Class Action, but it is still a Class Action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.670" offset="10646674">And my major point Your Honor is that because of all the benefits that flow from 16B, all this litigation from now on is going to be in the Federal Court and not in the State Courts and as we pointed out time and time again, and as the city attorneys point out in their briefs, there is no question, but what one-half of all their litigation involves personal matter, so, talking about a flood of litigation this would create.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.690" offset="10766733">So, we urge and we urge most strenuously, that this Act is invalid because they do not, Congress and its findings, does not show any real nexus to commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.781" offset="10827024">And above all, that under the Constitutional Federalism, it is invalid under the rules laid out in Fry, which Mr. Justice Marshall, I think does help us, because I do think the Tenth Amendment now has meaning and even be on the Tenth Amendment, because Constitutional Federalism existed before the Tenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.652" offset="10910511">I insist that when you have such a mammoth, massive takeover of state and local government affairs as this Act provides here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.948" offset="10955755">For example, in their reply brief they say that we complain, that they might come in and have inspections, and each inspection only takes 16 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.882" offset="10995461">Well now, imagine how many inspections New York City with the 300 and something thousand employees -- one inspection each or one for the whole city?</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.577" offset="11038302">Your Honor, I urge again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.508" offset="11045930">This Act has not been thought through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.096" offset="11056379">The regulations that have promulgated, they fit cities like a square pig in a round hole, they are unreasonable, they are invalid, they were issued six days as, Your Honor, will recall, before Christmas and could not be even read by cities or received by them much less considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.267" offset="11137045">So we urge that this Act be held invalid for the two reasons that I have urged now.</text>

            <text syncTime="2883.302" offset="11533166">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.155" offset="11536614">I am going to discuss a case which initially at least will not seem to have very much resemblance to the case Mr. Rhyne just discussed, because my version of what that act does is considerably different than appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.032" offset="11588127">The central issue here of course is the effect of the 74 Amendments to the Fair Labor Standards act upon Federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.878" offset="11615504">Mr. Rhyne has described a massive and disastrous impact upon cities and states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.455" offset="11637760">I think, I can state and show that it will be very little impact, certainly, no impact that threatens the value of Federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.440" offset="11673704">The issue between this can be stated as whether or not, and I think it can be stated the popularity of Maryland against Wirtz with the appellants varies from time to time, but I think the issue is still whether or not Maryland against Wirtz should be overruled and the dissent there become a new law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.816" offset="11751236">And I would suggest in the course of my argument that such a decision overturning Maryland against Wirtz, would do much more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.589" offset="11782269">It would undercut the rationale of almost all of the major Commerce Clause decisions of this court, including decisions in the field of the Agricultural Statutes, Labor Law, Civil Rights Law and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2959.369" offset="11837440">It might Mr. Justice White, but I am going to suggest that there are no adequate grounds for overruling except the rationale that would indeed have that kind of a Constitutional Counterrevolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.342" offset="11893342">The governments position rest upon three prepositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.900" offset="11911523">But first, let us put aside the question of Federalism for a moment and just deal with the jurisdiction or the power of the coverage of the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.638" offset="11946527">And I think, as to the coverage of the Commerce Clause, as to its application here, I would think that that much, not the Federalism issue, but that much would have been settled certainly decisively by Fry against the United States and certainly a lot of cases before that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.066" offset="12004206">Now my brother Rhyne would suggest that no consideration was given to this indeed, Congress debated, both the Center of the House debated and reports concluded discussions of the facts of interstate commerce involved here and the theories by which Commerce Clause applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.720" offset="12082782">I do not want to spend much time on this, but I feel I must spend some time on it because it has been attacked so strongly today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.822" offset="12115278">There is no doubt that interstate commerce is in play.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.220" offset="12124787">When we have state and local governments which in 1971 purchased 135 Billion dollars worth of goods and services and that was 12% of our gross National Product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.199" offset="12168777">Nor, I think, there can be no any doubt of the significance of this statute to that commerce, where it is realized that this Amendment extends the statute to 3.4 million employees, not just minimum wage, it also has overtime provisions, it also has Age Discriminations Provisions and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.670" offset="12246622">And that makes with the 1966 Amendment upheld in Maryland against Wirtz, a total of 6.3 million employees were covered by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.017" offset="12284029">Now, there are variety of reasons why extending Wages and Hour law to these employees as rationally related to commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.632" offset="12322482">Congress made the findings in our main brief in at pages 23 and 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.273" offset="12345051">We discussed -- the Senate report discussion of this is set out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.472" offset="12365845">Of course it is not up to the government here to prove again the factual findings that Congress made in the standard of review for Congress’ factual finding of that nature of course is set forth in the Heart of Atlanta Motel and Katzenbach against McClung.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.640" offset="12434495">And I think, they easily withstand that kind of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.090" offset="12456333">The theories upon which congress attacks this well were, first, that substandard working conditions are likely to lead to labor disputes, and hence, the strikes, that interrupt the flow of goods and services in the state commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.455" offset="12501786">That was, in the original finding of the Act, the original findings of the 1938 Act, the theory was adopted to support the 1966 Amendments in Maryland against Wirtz was advanced in debate here for the 1974 Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.517" offset="12554031">And this labor strike theory of course was accepted by this court as long ago as Labor Board against Jones and Laughlin, upholding the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.467" offset="12589767">Now, it should be said that Maryland against Wirtz covered mostly custodial workers, orderlies and nurses aides, and it is hard to think that any of the employees covered by the 1974 Amendments have a more tenuous nexus to interstate commerce than those employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.416" offset="12661656">We have dealt with in Maryland against Wirtz.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.068" offset="12672209">Second, I mentioned the competition between governments tends to or can spread substandard working conditions as governmental units compete with lower taxes and lower wage rates to make up for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.831" offset="12727275">I know for again that is a rational relationship, Congress can act on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.002" offset="12747964">I am not obliged to upheld the trial and prove that Congress’ factual finding were correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.739" offset="12770952">Thirdly, the increase of purchasing power through higher wages and the spread or work tends to stimulate interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.358" offset="12801358">Now, that is the theory of course, very much like the theory in which the 1964 Civil Rights Act was upheld in Katzenbach against McClung, where it was pointed out that refusal of certain restaurants to serve Blacks on all these food purchases which adversely effects in the state commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.938" offset="12867709">So that too has established constitutional mode applying the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.455" offset="12893727">And finally, it is quite clear, as the senate report states, that raising the minimum wage rate at a level which will at least help to assure the worker an income at or above the poverty level is essential to the reduction of the welfare rules and the overall reform of the welfares on the United States and certainly taking all people off welfare rules and giving them productive jobs is a means of affecting interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="3318.700" offset="13274697">It is exclusively stated in the senate report I refer to is to spread work to get some employers for some kinds of jobs, not to pay overtime, but instead to hire additional worker at straight time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3429.656" offset="13718570">But I would have thought that on the pure question of whether of this was rationally related to the interstate commerce, if there was no question but for Mr. Rhyne’s statements today.</text>

            <text syncTime="3479.564" offset="13918250">The conceptual argument is this, the 1974 Amendments, seem to me by their nature, less intrusive, less coercive, less damaging to state sovereignty, local sovereignty, and so less threatening the to the value of federalism than most of the statutes which this court has upheld, under the Commerce Clause in the past.</text>

            <text syncTime="6517.151" offset="26068532">I wonder if you would comment on whether or not this is the kind of problem that could best be addressed by Congress.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles S. Rhyne</label>
            <text syncTime="6522.306" offset="26089221">Let me tell you exactly what happened in the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="6526.892" offset="26107507">They did address their arguments to the Congress and they were beaten by big labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6533.592" offset="26134361">Two Secretaries of Agriculture testified that this Act was opposed the Act and one the ground that it would so overburden small government, really they should have said big government that it was unwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="6551.964" offset="26207817">Then, there was a presidential veto which was upheld and then without further hearing, big labor steamed rolled (ph) this through the Congress again.</text>
            <text syncTime="6562.101" offset="26248359">Now that is the Congressional record which cannot be challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="6568.094" offset="26272287">It is the record of this particular legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6571.751" offset="26286916">Now I would like--</text>

            <text syncTime="6572.736" offset="26290887">Before you answer the question, if I may suggest, that that is the political remedy but you claim the you have a constitutional barrier that prevents Congress from doing what it has done.</text>

            <text syncTime="6586.058" offset="26344176">Now I would like to correct and it always disturbed me when counsel on the other side, attacks figures, I would like to call the attention of the court to one very important thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6598.531" offset="26394122">Last night, I say, I got very late, a brief from the Solicitor General in which he comments a lot on a brief that we had filed and the urban data service is relied upon throughout that brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6619.982" offset="26479909">Well it so happens that the urban data service which I agree is the most reliable, the most knowledgeable, the best of all sources of interest in this country on government, is the one in the appendix to our brief, made the estimate of $1 billion per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="6644.014" offset="26576039">Now all these other --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="6645.605" offset="26582413">1 billion?</text>

            <text syncTime="6649.656" offset="26598609">Now they know what they are taking about, they base this on reports from city managers and those on the local level.</text>
            <text syncTime="6659.492" offset="26637897">Those people are not liars, they report what the facts are and so I say if the Solicitor General in his brief can rely on the urban data service, so can we.</text>
            <text syncTime="6670.997" offset="26683977">And that is exactly what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6675.119" offset="26700382">Now secondly, I would like to say there was some question about whether 85% of the budgets, R &amp; D personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="6687.076" offset="26748238">Now that is a fact that has appeared, it seemed like a thousand times in the media, I find that the first argument on page 38 that the Solicitor General himself said as I understand it in municipalities, the budget is 80%-85% wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="6705.802" offset="26823158">Now, the whole business that is so bothersome here is that the policy of a state, the policy of a city, the policy of a county is its budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="6720.454" offset="26881776">They are like telephone books, it tells what are you going to do, who are they going to serve, who are they going to hire what they are going to pay them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6727.354" offset="26909362">And what happens here is, for that telephone book, we are going to have this telephone book, the Federal Regulations replace it and in addition to this telephone book which sets forth all the Federal Regulations under the Fair Labor Standards Act, there is an addition.</text>
            <text syncTime="6745.346" offset="26981355">The very minute regulations as to police and fire, that makes your report every time, how long they eat, how long they sleep, it is the most intrusive, the most absolute interference that one can imagine.</text>
            <text syncTime="6767.897" offset="27071530">So, I would conclude that if we want in this 200th year to have a unitary government, okay, this is the way we will get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6785.118" offset="27140389">I went to the trouble of calling the Solicitor of the City of London to ask him who fixed the wages of his people because I would like to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="6792.562" offset="27170168">I want to know what Parliament had to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6794.166" offset="27176647">He said, “well, in the overall parliament can do it, but after underneath it, we do it all.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6800.703" offset="27202769">Now we have checked in Australia, we have checked in New Zealand, we have checked in many other countries, there is no county in the world with a national government, unless it is unitary, fixes the pay and the wages of everybody the way that is proposed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6816.007" offset="27264000">And I think that this idea of Federal regulations and the Federal Regulatory and Federal Courts, because you are going to be the final arbitrar of all of these states.</text>
            <text syncTime="6829.640" offset="27318544">They point out in these regulations that these are merely suggestive, that you go to Court to get everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="6835.227" offset="27340904">And you are going to have class actions and you are going to have all these cost and attorney’s fees and you are going to have it in the Federal Courts, because that is the only place you can get it.</text>

            <text syncTime="6864.441" offset="27457724">And why have duplicate regulation on top of regulation -- that is what you have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6873.462" offset="27493773">And we have a complete system now and when you dump all of the Federal Regulation on top of it, it will simply make states and cities fiscal integrity a question, not only in some of our larger cities but in our smaller cities as well.</text>
