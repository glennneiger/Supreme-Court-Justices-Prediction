            <label>Ms. Harriet S. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="30.918" offset="227035">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="34.087" offset="239679">This case is here on direct appeal by the Government from a decision of a three-judge district court in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.983" offset="271339">Like the previous case, it involves the challenge to the Federal Government's power to classify on the basis of alienage.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.650" offset="301955">The appellees are three aliens who wish to enroll in a subsidized federal medical insurance program for the elderly.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.463" offset="341243">This program is part of the overall Social Security Insurance System for people over 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.012" offset="371440">That system consists of three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.070" offset="383666">First, there is the basic retirement insurance which is old age and survivors insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.263" offset="412400">Eligibility for that insurance is based on age and work in covered employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.118" offset="439881">Citizenship or alienage has almost nothing to do with it and almost all employment in this country is covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.629" offset="477915">Second, there's hospital -- hospitalization insurance which is referred to us Medicare Part A and eligibility is based primarily on entitlement to the basic retirement insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.571" offset="541654">The third category is the one involved in this litigation and that is Medicare Part B, supplemental medical insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.595" offset="581778">Part B is a voluntary program.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.947" offset="595153">Those who enroll who currently pay $6.70 a month which the Government matches.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.327" offset="624724">The fund created by these contributions pays 80% of covered medical expenses and they're mainly doctor's fees and medication.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.497" offset="677386">Appellees are all over 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.733" offset="690343">They want to enroll in Medicare sub Part B but they were refused because Part B insurance is available only to persons who are eligible for Part A insurance to citizens or to aliens admitted for permanent residence who have actually been residents for five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.290" offset="776547">All three named appellees entered this country in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.949" offset="795146">So they don't need the five-year residence requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.818" offset="810611">In addition, two of the appellees were admitted under the special Cuban refugee program and not for permanent residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.480" offset="849272">So on that ground also, they're ineligible for Medicare Part B.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.647" offset="869961">The Cuban program does not -- does permit a retroactive adjustment of status.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.820" offset="890650">So that by the time these two appellees have been here for five years, they probably will be eligible for Medicare Part B since their status will have been adjusted to that of permanent resident aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.532" offset="945507">This is a class action and the court below defined the class as all immigrants denied enrollment in sub Part B because they're not lawfully admitted for permanent residents and have not met the five-year residency requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.768" offset="1006425">It also established a Sub Class represented by single appellee, Espinosa of those denied benefits solely because they could not meet the durational residence requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.600" offset="1065775">The Court held that the durational residence requirement denied appellees equal protection because it did -- it was not rationally related to any valid congressional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.551" offset="1113527">It also held that the durational residence requirement was not separable from the requirement that the alien be lawfully admitted for permanent residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.721" offset="1158248">And therefore, it struck all the aliage provisions from the Medicare Sub Part B eligibility provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.273" offset="1196492">We've discussed the separability issue in our brief and I don't propose to discuss that further this afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.877" offset="1242885">It is our contention here as it was in the preceding case that equal protection analysis is simply inappropriate when considering federal statutes dealing with alienage in view of the basis and extent of Congress' broad powers over immigration.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.678" offset="1330134">Solicitor general presented that view this morning and I don't propose to go into that again.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.157" offset="1363989">I do want to point out that the Medicare eligibility provision at issue here is closely related to immigration policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.651" offset="1402023">As a matter of fact, the court below rather surprisingly indicated that it had doubts about the constitutionality of the admitted for permanent residence requirement for part of the statute precisely because it was so closely related to the policy expressed in the Immigration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.809" offset="1502647">The Immigration Act provides that one of the qualifications for admission as an immigrant is that the applicant not be likely to become a public charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.669" offset="1550085">Now the practical effect of that requirement particularly for people over 60, are the only ones that are affected by this Medicare provision is that they must either be economically independent or have someone in this country who is willing to assume responsibility for their support.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.677" offset="1638066">The Medicare limitation simply defines the extent of the support obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.458" offset="1669204">The effect of the immigration statute and the Medicare statute taken together is the same as if Congress had explicitly provided in the Immigration Act that elderly immigrants must undertake to provide for their own medical needs for five years after they enter either by private insurance or by having the financial capability of doing it independently of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.468" offset="1801279">Congress could certainly have done -- made that provision directly in the Immigration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.329" offset="1828655">We submit that Congress has an equal right to do it indirectly through the Medicare Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.232" offset="1868257">It's the essence of congressional power over immigration to decide which groups it will encourage to immigrate, and which discourage and also to decide how much encouragement it will offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.093" offset="1939728">An elderly person considering immigration will normally consider the cost of living in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.030" offset="1971493">Part of that cost is the cost medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.268" offset="1992495">If subsidized government insurance is available, the cost will be lower than if it is not and if it's available after five years, the cost is less than if it's not available at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.505" offset="2057383">Immigration is thus encouraged by making the insurance available, but it's not encouraged as much as it would be if the insurance was available immediately on entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.006" offset="2115375">Congressional judgments concerning immigration policy are entitled to great judicial deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.205" offset="2140244">This Medicare eligibility provision is an expression of congressional immigration policy and as such it's entitled to great judicial deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.636" offset="2209938">For that reason, even if this judgment is subject to review on equal protection grounds, the Court need do no more than assure itself that there's a rational justification for the restrictions on alien eligibility and there is such a justification in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.197" offset="2300113">The Part B Medicare program is part of the overall Social Security Insurance Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.290" offset="2336580">That program is not basically a welfare program in which payments are based on current needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.038" offset="2371480">There's no means test for eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.403" offset="2389034">Instead, the insurance is available to those to whom Congress has determined that the country owes an obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.422" offset="2433024">This Court has in fact recognized that that sense of obligation is the basis of the original Social Security Program which is of course the root stock of the whole Federal Social Insurance Program particularly for the elderly.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.376" offset="2504913">If I may quote from Flemming v. Nestor, the program is based on a legislative judgment that those who in their productive years were functioning members of the economy may just call on that economy in their later years for protection from the rigors of the poor house.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.554" offset="2613582">In setting up the Part B eligibility provisions, Congress went somewhat further.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.890" offset="2642944">It extended the benefits to all citizens and to aliens with a substantial relation to this country but the theory remained the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.201" offset="2692159">Congress simply recognized that resident aliens like citizens pay taxes are subject to military service and contribute in myriad other ways to our national community.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.774" offset="2758510">Citizens, who in the overwhelming majority of cases make these contributions throughout their lives, may not enroll in Sub Part B until they're 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.088" offset="2807724">An alien, who makes his myriad contributions in his country of origin during his working life may retire and come here and after only five years of contributing to this community, he's eligible to enroll in Medicare Sub Part B on the same basis as a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.073" offset="2899675">That's not certainly an unreasonable discrimination against the alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.843" offset="2926738">In fact, the only person is more favorably treated would be a US citizen who had never lived in this country and then returned in his old age and was immediately eligible for the Medicare Sub Part B and that I submit is such a small group that its really diminimous.</text>

            <text syncTime="770.331" offset="3184724">He has been living here, he has been contributing as a member of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.929" offset="3223071">Congress decided that five years of participation in the national community is enough for eligibility for Medicare Part B.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.295" offset="3260583">It could have made the period longer or it could have made it shorter that drew the line at five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.825" offset="3290676">Under traditional equal protection analysis, this Court should not decide whether that was the best place to draw the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.241" offset="3328293">The line is however, consistent with the Immigration Act which also uses five years as the period in which the alien is in some way is here on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.728" offset="3382314">His native country remains more responsible for him during that period than it is after five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.841" offset="3410735">For example, he ordinarily can't be -- can be deported for indigency within five years or for a single crime which involves interpretive committed within that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.335" offset="3468727">Of course too, he may not ordinarily be naturalized until he has been here for five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.597" offset="3493804">So that until that time, there can't be no full assumption of the rights of citizenship nor total disillusion of the bond with his native country.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.693" offset="3542183">We submit therefore that the distinction between citizens and aliens in the Medicare program is not unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.784" offset="3574471">It also serves the rational fiscal purpose of reducing the amount of the federal subsidy required for the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.901" offset="3602996">Court below thought that the Government did not benefit financially from postponing the eligibility of aliens except to the extent that they die.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.816" offset="3642598">It made two assumptions not supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.521" offset="3661406">First, it assumed that no elderly aliens returned to their native country before five years are up.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.651" offset="3689932">And second, that they postponed needed care which it further assumed made the eventual cost to the Government of the insurance as great as if they were eligible immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.980" offset="3747297">The immigration service does not have records of how many elderly immigrants leave the country within five years and the second assumption is pure speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.854" offset="3790764">Of course if it's true, it's equally irrational to deny benefits to those have not yet reached 65 because they too will postpone necessary care which could have been provided more cheaply before they reach 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.788" offset="3862549">Anyway, we submit that these are certainly legislative judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.476" offset="3881253">This is a novel program which has been under constant legislative review and it is up to Congress to evaluate all these factors and decide whether and how much to liberalize eligibility for Medicare.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.262" offset="3960456">I like to reserve the remainder of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="979.876" offset="4022836">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.850" offset="4038823">It seems to me that Mrs. Shapiro's argument rests primarily on Mr. Bork's original argument which was that the Fifth Amendment notions of equal protection do not apply to aliens or if that is true and that is what this Court holds, then I think this case falls for my clients, I think the case argued previously falls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.728" offset="4174242">But I don't believe that that is true because that is such an overwhelmingly inconsistent and novel argument that implicit within it are the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.097" offset="4251773">That a classification which this Court has now held three times explicitly ones but implicitly two other times and many other Courts have followed, that is a classification of aliens is not inherently suspect when that classification is made by the Federal Government rather than the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="1122.290" offset="4592515">Well, I think Mr. Bork's argument did in the brief that was filed by the Government in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.011" offset="4627414">The argument that repeated at least four times was that the Government has made the discrimination in this case against aliens, has made the classification in this case against aliens and indeed in virtually all of those statutes which are listed in the appendix attached to the one brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.536" offset="4709543">The Government's one brief because the aliens have not shown a “substantial and enduring connection with the United States efficient for the United States Government to grant them the benefits that are granted to citizens under each of those particular provisions,” the one we're talking about here are Medicare B provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.981" offset="4791254">Well, the substantial and enduring connection with the United States is really saying aliens when you compare aliens with citizens, citizens have an absolute and enduring connection with the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.806" offset="4850604">So those who do not have relatives to citizens, those who do not have a substantial and enduring connection with the United Sates are aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.841" offset="4882787">Now, if that's the basis of the discrimination and it is asserted repeatedly, in fact that is headed as the theme of the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.782" offset="4918523">The theme of a classifications in each of these cases is that the underlying theme, I think the words are used, are that they do not have a substantial and enduring connection with the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.472" offset="4965230">Well this is advancing a new test of legislation which creates classifications because the test, the traditional test and I'm not talking about the test now that is used for suspect classifications or with or fundamental interest involved or any special circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.811" offset="5046627">Just the traditional test is the one articulated in a case which did not involve a suspect classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.727" offset="5094275">It involved the question of whether a conscientious objector could receive the same benefits as a veteran after having finished his conscientious objector service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.271" offset="5152475">And he said that he was discriminated against because he serves his country just as veterans who had fought in the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.285" offset="5180479">This Court upheld that discrimination and that classification in that case but the Court went on to say that our analysis of the classification proceeds on the basis that although an individual's right to equal protection of the law does not deny the power to treat different classes of persons in different ways, it denied the power to legislate that different treatment be accorded to persons, placed by statute into different classes on the basis of criteria wholly unrelated to the objective of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.416" offset="5321017">A classification must be reasonable, not arbitrary and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.409" offset="5389040">Now, here we are told that there is a new test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.843" offset="5402728">We do not look at the object of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.621" offset="5413804">Medicare, the object of the statute is to take care of retirement age individuals, medical problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.433" offset="5445151">In this case Medicare Part B, it's related to physician services generally, arguably some argue with the all home health care services, dietary services, out patient services, those kind of services are the kind of services that are involved in Medicare Part B.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.500" offset="5513383">There are some more of them, but you can get the idea of those services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.507" offset="5529370">To distinguish from Part A really which it deals with hospitalization benefit, Part B usually talks about medical benefits which are doctor services.</text>

            <text syncTime="1412.903" offset="5754964">And so, while it as us true that Part B and it is natural that part B should fall upon Part A and it is called the Medicare program and it is within the preview of the Social Security Act which is all of Title 42 is called a social security provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.913" offset="5850990">In reality, social security has very little to deal with it, that is social security to the man in the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.856" offset="5874813">It has to do with somebody's choosing to participate, it's a voluntary program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.590" offset="5897697">Somebody who is 65 years old choosing to seek insurance that is available pursuant to congressional enactment for which a premium is paid by the applicant and a like premium or an equal or part of the premium is paid by the tax payers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.212" offset="5980244">Those tax payers not only include aliens, but the children of aliens and anybody related to aliens who are living in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.548" offset="6029563">So the argument that an alien is here only for five years and is contributing only five years, it's a specious argument, particularly when we will look at -- and the problem in this case really arose definitionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.446" offset="6105109">The classification here that we're talking about is an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence who has resided in the United States continuously during the five years immediately proceeding the month in which he applies for the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.686" offset="6222137">So we have two residency requirements here, a durational residency requirement and a status residency requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.333" offset="6252753">The status being that of permanent resident and forgetting for a moment about the durational residency requirement which was declared unconstitutional by the District Court in this case and going to the question of the status residency requirement for moment, it is to be noted that the problem arises because of the nature or the manner in which Cuban refugees were allowed to come in to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.603" offset="6401755">Indeed allowed is very conservative word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.404" offset="6417011">Those of us who have lived in this country for the last 10 years know that President Eisenhower made a speech in which he beseeched the Cubans who wanted to escape from Castro's Cuba, Castro taking over in Cuba in 1959, this speech was made I believe in 1961 to come in to the United States, inducing them to come in to the United States, so the point where we started sending planes during the 1960's to pick up anybody who Castro would allow onto those planes to bring them into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.916" offset="6551071">So here we begged these people to come in to the United States and thousands and thousands and thousands of them came.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.193" offset="6580120">Indeed it is estimated that approximately 600 to 700,000 came.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.433" offset="6601122">And of those numbers approximately 250,000 to 300,000, the figures were inaccurate, they were coming in such great numbers that they were overwhelming the agencies that were taking care of them and the coming from Miami, Florida I am quite familiar with the chaos that was caused by this enormous numbers of Cubans coming in to the community, the bureaucratic problems of counting them for example and analyzing what their status was and figuring out how to allow them into the United States under the then current laws of the United States was a very serious problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.608" offset="6773844">At the beginning when they were trickling in, they came in as non-immigrants and when their non-immigrant visa run out, they were then subject to deportation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.690" offset="6822118">During the deportation proceedings, they claimed political asylum and it was granted to them. This was a very cumbersome process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.499" offset="6861406">When they claimed political asylum, they became immigrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.128" offset="6875930">Once they became immigrants, they qualified for the Medicare Part B provision because the definition of immigrant is a person admitted for permanent residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.761" offset="6934444">So those who were fortunate enough to be defined as immigrants which was just fortuitous, depended on when and how they came in to this country are qualified for Medicare Part B, but as the numbers increased and they became -- they started coming in by the thousands, a more efficient way had to be found to allow them to come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.889" offset="7034964">And the more efficient way was to choose to allow them to come in under the parole powers of the Attorney General of the United States which are -- which gave the Attorney General the power to allow virtually any foreign who enter the United States, any alien into the United States under any conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.521" offset="7121481">This power is given to him by Congress and it is very, very wide and broad power, a wide and broad power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.901" offset="7155022">And so approximately 250 to 300,000 people came in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.776" offset="7170487">Now the problem with those people coming in is what brings us before this Court because they came in as their classification was parolee and a parolee as we point out in our brief is neither an immigrant nor a non-immigrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.659" offset="7241958">He is in a special status of parolee and the term which is used referring now to the status term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.452" offset="7285217">Resident -- an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence does not cover parolee, at the historical development of the definition of that term, does not cover parolees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.519" offset="7341432">So now we have -- it's estimated by the lower court and my calculations are about the same on the basis of these sketchy figures that we have, we have somewhere in the neighborhood of 20,000 individuals who are parolees.</text>

            <text syncTime="2628.992" offset="10619382">It fits to Congress and that's the point because Congress in a related provision and yes I saw a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.398" offset="10660968">So forget the question of the alien who comes in as a parolee and here we're talking about indigents whereas in the case before the Court we're not necessarily talking about indigents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.390" offset="10716975">And what Congress did was they said the following, this is an Act of Congress that I'm reading from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.920" offset="10767026">Congress has authorized welfare payments to the indigent blind, aged and disabled individual who is “either (1) a citizen or (2) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law,” continuing the statute, “including any alien who is lawfully present in the United States as a result of the provisions of Section 1153 (a) 7 which is conditional entrance,” which is in the class that's included by the lower court in this case or “Section 1182 (d) 5 which is parolee.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.527" offset="10925432">So in other words what Congress has done here is included in the SSI provisions of the Social Security Act coverage for the persons who are excluded from the Medicare B provisions of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.892" offset="10994918">And no doubt it was an inadvertent failure on the part of Congress to do that but we are submitting that it is possible for this Court to construe the admittance for permanent residency requirements as covering Cuban parolees because of the fact that they are covered here, because of the fact that since 1971 they must not only have registered for the military service but are subject to induction in the military service as our citizens and because of the fact that they are entitled to retroactive adjustment of status which non-immigrants are not entitled to generally with some exceptions or after two years presence in the United States, they can make an application fro retroactive adjustment of status to become immigrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.485" offset="11221347">Actually it takes four years to get that retroactive adjustment and that's why I said my clients could not receive it.</text>
