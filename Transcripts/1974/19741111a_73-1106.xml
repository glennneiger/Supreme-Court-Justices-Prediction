            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">72, in which 59 respondents were elected as delegates to the 1972 Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.769" offset="35004">On March 31, 1972, 10 petitioners filed the challenge in accordance with the rules of the Democratic National Party contending that respondents have violated National Party rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.023" offset="88085">And that they've discriminated invidiously and substantially on the basis of race against women and young people and that they had held secret and close slate making meetings, all in express violation of the National Party rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.830" offset="151301">On April 19, 1972, the respondents filed the complaint in the Circuit Court of Cook County, alleging that respondents because they were elected in accordance with state law, were the only delegates who could be seated at the 1972 Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.037" offset="228101">Petitioners sought to remove that case to the Northern District of Illinois federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.956" offset="251820">The motion to remand the case was granted on the grounds that no constitutional or federal question was presented by the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.101" offset="288392">Petitioners also sought to enjoin the action in the state court pursuant to Section 1983, an injunction was issued for time but was subsequently vacated by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and stay of the Seventh Circuit Court was denied by Mr. Justice Rehnquist in Chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.594" offset="378358">Pursuant to the National Party rules, on May 31, June 1, and June 8, 1972, hearings were held in Chicago at which both respondents and petitioners participated presenting argument, filing motions, presenting witnesses and documentary evidence all before a hearing examiner appointed by the Democratic National Committee, Mr. Cecil F. Poole.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.507" offset="494028">On June 25, 1972, Mr. Poole issued a report in which he upheld the allegations of petitioners and that is that respondents had discriminated invidiously and substantially on a basis of race and against women and young people.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.656" offset="570619">He also found that respondents had conducted closed and secret slate meetings in violation of National Party rules and he also found that respondents had no rules for governing their procedures, although, that too was required by Democratic National Party rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.785" offset="847099">All the 59 respondents were found to have violated the National Party rules, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.574" offset="870296">On June 30, 1972, after a highly publicized and intense debate before the Credentials Committee of the Democratic National Party, the Credentials Committee ruled to seek petitioners and not to grant respondents' credentials to the 1972 Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.623" offset="962456">The Credentials Committee expressly rejected respondents' claim that state law exclusively governs the selection of delegates to the 1972 Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.759" offset="1027030">In minority report of the Credential's Committee favoring respondents' position was filed with the 1972 Democratic National Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.141" offset="1092545">On Monday, July 3, 1972, respondents filed and action in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia in which they sought to reverse the decision of the Credentials Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.244" offset="1152940">They alleged that they have been exclusive -- they have been elected in accordance with state law and therefore were entitled to be seated.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.477" offset="1181884">They also alleged violation of constitutional rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.713" offset="1206753">On the same day, July 3rd, the Federal District Court Judge Hart dismissed respondents' complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.764" offset="1246981">Now, the Credentials Committee had also voted to unseat the part of the delegates which had been elected in accordance with the California primary law and to seat in it instead that delegation selected by appointment of the presidential contenders other than Mr. McGovern.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.036" offset="1316049">That delegation, the unseated California delegates also brought an action in Federal District Court and their complaint was also dismissed by Judge Hart.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.948" offset="1367771">On the 4th of July, the day after the dismissal by Judge Hart, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia combined both the California and the Illinois cases for oral argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="361.765" offset="1446975">The Court said and expressly approved the resolution of the Credentials Committee seating petitioners and unseating our respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.102" offset="1496398">To protect this jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals also granted an injunction to prohibit the Illinois respondents from proceeding in any other Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.826" offset="1535269">On the same day the respondents' petitioned this Court for writ of certiorari and for a stay of the elec -- of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.331" offset="1581244">On the evening of July 7, 1972, this Court's opinion issued granting a stay of both the Illinois and the California decisions of the Court of Appeals but also expressly denying -- expressly refusing to act on respondents' petition for writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.113" offset="1668389">The following evening, July 8th, respondents petitioned the Circuit Court of Cook County for an injunction to enjoin the petitioners from participating as the delegates from the Chicago districts in the 1972 Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.561" offset="1738188">Petitioners did participate in that convention and after a hard fought political battle, after which numerous comprises were offered and rejected by various parties, the 1972 Convention upheld the ruling of a hearing examiner and the holding of its Credentials Committee that respondents had violated National Party rules and that National Credential should be awarded to petitioners and not to respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.672" offset="1850619">On August 2, 1972, briefly after the convention was over, respondents again went to the Circuit Court of Cook County and sought an injunction against petitioners from participating from in the selection of National Committee Men and Committee Women from Illinois.</text>

            <text syncTime="493.881" offset="1975484">And on February 16, 1973, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia found that the National Convention had acted within its confidence in granting its credentials to petitioners and refusing the credentials to respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.892" offset="2047478">The Court of Appeals found the case moot but nonetheless affirmed the decision of Judge Hart dismissing respondents' complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.421" offset="2089587">On September 12, 1973, the Illinois' appellate court affirmed the two injunction orders of the Circuit Court of Cook County.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.069" offset="2132219">The Illinois appellate court found that Illinois law was exclusive and convention rules and national rules were of no effect and that the Illinois law exclusively govern the election of delegates to the convention and the convention was without power or authority to refuse the seat them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1575.484" offset="6301884">In -- to support the injunction in this case, the respondents had argued that there's a compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.325" offset="6329260">While they don't argue that there are any constitutional rights at stake, they say that the state has an interest in protecting its election process and to achieve this protection, they would have that injunction be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.123" offset="6376490">But the effect of that injunction is one of two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.693" offset="6390700">First, it would force the National Party to seat respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.341" offset="6405329">That's what the Illinois appellate court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.641" offset="6414524">Individuals who the National Party has expressly found violated their most fundamental principles and with whom the National Party did not want to associate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.240" offset="6448901">Or the second thing would be that there would be no persons from Illinois as seated at the National Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.202" offset="6476800">It's not conceivable what state interest is protected by having no citizens from the State of Illinois and that was certainly the interest which persuaded the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and the Riddell Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.964" offset="6531762">Also, that argument ignores the strong national interest of the party to associate so it can rally its members for its nominee to win the November election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.265" offset="6580976">The argument ignores that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1732.001" offset="6927987">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.486" offset="6945855">The issue in this case is whether the state's interest is insufficient to enable it to enforce voting and associational rights of its citizens through injunction proceedings against certain of its citizens from assuming party officers to which they were not elected, and from representing a particular electorate which did not choose them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.909" offset="7055569">The facts underlying this issue have been largely, totally ignored by petitioners and have not been properly heard in any Court until they were heard in the Circuit Court of Cook County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.030" offset="7128085">Those underlying facts which give rise to the injunction and which were not heard are the Illinois election law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.824" offset="7163193">The nature of the election itself, the voter and associational rights of Illinois citizens to choose their representatives, and to associate with each other in political parties, and the findings that were made concerning the nature of the petitioner's slate of delegates itself and the manner in which they were chosen by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.786" offset="7287118">With regard to all these things, we are here on a record which is largely uncontested and in which the findings of fact which came after two evidentiary hearings which all persons who participated were not objected to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.200" offset="7348767">I would like to dispose, if I may, of the res judicata argument because that has taken up a large part of the petitioner's brief and in the context of these cases, it creates a cloud which has to be dispelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.988" offset="7411879">If anything, res judicata requires an identity of issues in opportunity to litigate those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.285" offset="7469140">The issues before the District of Columbia Courts, both the District Court and the Circuit Court, were the constitutionality of certain guidelines of the Democratic Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.694" offset="7522743">These included two guidelines concerning the imposition of quotas and two guidelines which dealt with slate-making in the endorsement of candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.838" offset="7559314">When this came before the District Court, Judge Hart specifically refused to hear any questions concerning the legality of the slate's chosen in Illinois but concern himself only with the questions of constitutionality of the guidelines holding three constitutional and one unconstitutional and he refused to issue an injunction sought by the Democratic National Committee against state court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.634" offset="7682508">It should be noted that the original litigants in that case were the duly elected delegates in Illinois through a representative -- the demo -- and the Democratic National Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.826" offset="7727229">When the case went before the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia unreviewed, the Court sustained Judge Hart's finding with regard to the one particular guideline which he held unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.604" offset="7794416">The Court stated specifically in part two of its opinion which dealt with the Illinois challenge to the guidelines that the issue before the court below was the constitutionality of the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.468" offset="7845825">The Court then went on in part three which dealt with the Illinois counterclaim and said, “Because the convention is heard upon us, the issue must be decided, not heard but decided.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.618" offset="7910400">And thereupon issue its injunction against the proceedings in the Illinois Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.514" offset="7934015">The Court made clear in its opinion that Judge Hart stated that the legality of the slate -- of petitioners here was not for him but nevertheless issued its injunction which was subsequently stayed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.548" offset="7998171">So that when the case went that to Illinois with all parties present by counsel for evidentiary hearing, there had been no finding concerning the legality of petitioner's slate, and this was the only and precise question presented to the Illinois Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.519" offset="8086047">So, in these circumstances where there were no identity of issues, no opportunity to litigate, no pleadings or proof, and no finding concerning legality of that slate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.302" offset="8149159">It seems difficult to us to concede or assume that there was some res judicata or collateral estoppel effect leftover after the injunction had been stayed by this Court at the time this Court criticized the District of Columbia -- the Court of Appeals decision.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jerome H. Torshen</label>
            <text syncTime="2235.847" offset="8943386">It was not an issue nor with defense which might give rise to a decision before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.390" offset="8965538">In that regard, Your Honor, it should be noted that the Illinois Court found that the Illinois elections was free, equal, open, and non-discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.739" offset="9034919">That challenge was never -- that finding was never challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.621" offset="9054459">Secondly, with regard to the particular election with which we're concerned, it should be noted that prior to the fight over the guidelines, there was certainly a great deal of federal intervention into the Illinois procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.354" offset="9129378">For example, the delegates were chosen from single member from districts, congressional districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.322" offset="9157277">These districts had been recently reapportioned by a plan approved by the United States District Court in the Northern District of Illinois which enjoins state agencies from acting in any way to put forth their own plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.879" offset="9215478">So, the districts from which the delegates where chosen, the congressional districts, were established by the federal Court, one man one vote and no invidious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.490" offset="9257900">Secondly, the persons who could choose the representatives for Democratic Party were also determine by the federal courts in Kusper versus Pontikes which voided the Illinois anti-rating statute which provided then that anyone could vote in a democratic primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.605" offset="9342328">This Court Kusper versus Pontikes subsequently affirm that finding and said, that the citizens of Illinois had to have the right to associate with other members of the party to choose their representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.064" offset="9400216">Thirdly, the federal courts three years earlier, Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Weisberg versus Powell determined the method in which persons were to be place on the ballot in situations such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.429" offset="9469701">It was to be by luck or half draw if you will base upon the day that your application was received by the Secretary of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.723" offset="9506795">So, here we have a situation in which many aspects of this particular election including the district, the electorate from which the choice was to be made and ballot position was determined by the federal Court, and it now appears to be petitioners position here that having done all these, the vote should not be counted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.708" offset="9590805">Especially, after they concede that the election was free, open and non-discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.182" offset="9616718">We think, Your Honor, that there can be no such result as they are but that the votes were entitled to be counted and that the election was not a charade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.283" offset="9657051">The Illinois rules were very clear, anyone could run.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.854" offset="9671367">There were minimal requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.894" offset="9679517">Anyone could vote and in fact they did vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.132" offset="9692473">There were challenged procedures at all phases of the election process and yet not one of the 180 candidates for the 62 delegate positions were challenged by anyone throughout the election process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.706" offset="9754749">In it's this particular election, this popular election, held under these safeguards that petitioners here say must be totally ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.586" offset="9798322">We don't think that that's the result that can be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.823" offset="9811278">And what was the state interest here that they were protecting?</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.094" offset="9828310">We have to look to that, Your Honor, again to the hearings that were held in the state court because it's the only place that such hearings were held and this concerns the manner in which the respond -- the petitioners, I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.229" offset="9884839">The petitioners were chosen to represent the Illinois democratic election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.421" offset="9909603">They were chosen in private caucuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.368" offset="9921411">The rules provided that only the losers in the general election could vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.796" offset="9947115">Secondly, strict quotas and race, sex, and age were applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.070" offset="9980238">Third, as stated in the appendix by one of the District Coordinators, one of the counsels for petitioners, the rights of the individual voters were to be ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.393" offset="10025482">And lastly again is in the record, developed on cross examination from the co-leader of petitioners' slate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.665" offset="10078563">The voters who voted for those persons who won were disenfranchised because their candidates were tainted as were candidates themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.526" offset="10122031">So, all of these people were excluded from the election process and yet, sought to represent the democratic electorate of Illinois and in it's against this group that the state issued its injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.969" offset="10179814">Now, when I talked about quotas, the evidence is very clear on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.683" offset="10198727">For example, the first congressional district of Illinois which encompasses the Hyde Park area is in large measure black, part white and at the caucus meeting held in private home, it was stated, all of the delegate selected could -- must be black based upon the population or there could be at the very most one white.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.375" offset="10293499">Now, anyone who lives in Hyde Park in Chicago shops at the Hyde Park Co-Op, it's a large supermarket.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.853" offset="10319412">And if you walked down the aisle there pass the produce sections, it's quite obvious that there are a large number of Orientals who live in Hyde Park, persons of oriental descent and one of them asked at the caucus, “May I be elected?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.700" offset="10370717">The answer was, “No, you can't be elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.176" offset="10380643">You're neither black nor white.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.929" offset="10391615">In the Eight District where only four persons came to attend, it took two votes to determine who the delegates would be because the quotas weren't met.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.628" offset="10438426">So, these were people and this was the selection process that was to be foisted upon the people of Illinois in connection with the convention.</text>

            <text syncTime="3320.987" offset="13283892">The normal appeal procedures would be in effect through the Illinois courts and I suppose ultimately on certiorari by this Court, if the Court shows to take or if it went that far.</text>

            <text syncTime="3344.101" offset="13376366">But the trial judge in this case was concerned because the issue was raised in the Illinois appellate court that he had no jurisdiction to act it all and it's come up to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.106" offset="13428402">Your Honor, we think that in this particular matter, the delegates were elected by the people of the state in a proper and fair election.</text>

            <text syncTime="3382.839" offset="13531324">We do not think that the petitioners had such credentials and we think in the circumstances of this case, the Illinois Court was entitled to protect not only those people who voted in the Illinois primary but those who took office and also to protect the Illinois election structure itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.152" offset="13620558">Now, I should conclude Your Honors by stating in the appendix at page 106, there's a transcript of what happened at one of the caucuses held by the petitioners wherein their delegates where their slate were elected and in answer to complaints raised by the assembled citizenry, they said, “Raise this question in the state courts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.210" offset="13728810">And this is precisely what was done Your Honor, and we think it would be reversing the trend of history to say that the state courts did not held a sufficient interest to enable it to protect its own election laws in its electorate.</text>
