            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear arguments first this morning in 73-1380 and 1666, 1667, Chemehuevi Tribe of Indians against the Federal Power Commission and related cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.540" offset="217527">Mr. Wallace you may proceed when you're ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="35.373" stopTime="695.105">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="35.373" offset="244903">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.724" offset="258278">In this case, the complainants who are two Indian tribes, two environmental organizations and several individuals brought a proceeding in the Federal Power Commission seeking to require the intervening companies to apply for licenses for six existing and planned thermal-electric facilities in the so-called Four Corners area of the Southwest, all of which draw their cooling waters from various places in the Colorado River System but none of which draw their cooling waters from any project licensed by the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.775" offset="474467">The claim was made that the Commission has jurisdiction, licensing jurisdiction over these plants both under the so-called project works clause and because the plants use surplus water from government dams or at least arguably some of them do.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.161" offset="572061">The Commission dismissed the complaint on the basis of its longstanding interpretation that part one of the Act gives a jurisdiction to license only hydroelectric facilities and not thermal-electric facilities whether they're fossil-fueled burning facilities or atomic facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.200" offset="684178">That the jurisdiction under both clauses of the Act is limited to the licensing of project works or the use of surplus water by hydroelectric facilities which use water power for the generation of electricity, the power of falling water.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.947" offset="779160">On review, the Court of Appeals agreed with the Commission in rejecting the principal contention that was being made in the case under the project works clause but how did the Commission does have licensing authority with respect to the use of surplus water by thermal-electric plants and ordered the case remanded to the Commission to determine whether surplus water within the meaning of the statute was being used by these facilities and the relationship between the Commission's jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of other federal agencies who have the authority over the disposition of the water at the various projects involved in the Colorado system.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.375" offset="1012903">This Court granted cross-petitions for certiorari and by agreement of the parties, the opening briefs on all issues were filed by the Power Commission and the intervenor companies and I will be speaking for 20 minutes for the Power Commission and Mr. Ely will be speaking for 10 minutes for the intervenor companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.375" offset="1104854">At the outset, now the issue has not been contested in this Court before is not a new issue in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.853" offset="1166817">In 1965, in a case titled Federal Power Commission against Union Electric Company, in volume 381 U.S., all nine justices addressed the issue in the context of determining whether there was jurisdiction in the Commission to license a pumped-storage plant and the case was decided on the premise that the Commission has no licensing jurisdiction with respect to thermal-electric facilities, a premise that was accepted by all parties in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.960" offset="1355212">And previously, as the Court of Appeals pointed out, an opinion of this Court in 1953, United States against Public Utilities Commission, and this is explained in the appendix on page 89 (a) and footnote 123 that opinion of this Court by Mr. Justice Reed was written on the assumption that the Commission has no licensing jurisdiction with respect to thermal-electric facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.308" offset="1492616">Nonetheless, at the outset of the complainants argue in this Court that the plain meaning of the statute precludes the interpretation of the Act to which all nine justices subscribed in the Union Electric case and which was also reflected in the opinion in the Public Utilities Commission case by Mr. Justice Reed.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.176" offset="1624064">This obviously is a difficult argument to make but it's being made in the context of a statute in which the legislative history is quite devastating to the position that they are espousing.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.680" offset="1722075">In our brief, and more elaborately in the intervenor's brief, we've addressed the problems with the language of the Act and why the language can be construed and perhaps more reasonably should be construed on its face in favor of our interpretation of the Act and the interpretation previously reflected in the Court's opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.906" offset="1835029">I don't propose to rehearse that during the argument because it seems to us too late in the day after 54 years of interpretation by the Commission after pronouncements and opinions of this Court, after a major reenactment by Congress in 1935 in light of the Commission's interpretations for us to think that this issue can be decided on the bare words of the statute without looking beyond them.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.723" offset="1990301">And I might say after widespread reliance during those 54 years by not only the industry but by our consumers of electric power.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.145" offset="2039933">And so, I think the Court of Appeals was quite right in examining the legislative history in detail as it did with respect to the contention under the project works clause and basically we're in agreement with that aspect of the Court of Appeals' opinion and analysis which showed that the original part one of the Federal Power Act which was called the Federal Water Power Act was in its antecedents and in its enactment, concerned exclusively with giving Federal Licensing Authority over the development of hydroelectric power.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.071" offset="2239613">The dominant concern in the enactment of the legislation was to foster the maximum development and utilization of hydroelectric power so as to minimize the extent to which fossil fuels would have to be consumed in the production of power and pollution would occur from the burning of fossil fuels.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.289" offset="2348492">It was assumed by everyone that the need was to give the regulatory jurisdiction with respect to the hydroelectric facilities to assure that the potential of the waters wouldn't be wasted by short-sided development or by development at one point that wouldn't enable maximum utilization at other points in the river system.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.642" offset="2461968">And there were also concerns that excessive profits might be made by the utilization of the hydroelectric sites because it was cheaper to produce the electric power by this method and there was also the possibility of making excessive profits at the time the license is expired and the facilities were converted and so safeguards replaced in the law with respect to that aspect of it as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.589" offset="2593729">And if you just side the highlights from subsequent developments starting in 1921 in its first annual report to Congress and repeatedly to the series of annual reports, the Commission, the Federal Power Commission indicated that its jurisdiction, under the act, not merely under the project works clause, I should say, but under the act was limited to hydroelectric facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.369" offset="2740851">And there was indication that Congress was well aware of this when they reenacted Federal Water Power Act as the part one of the Federal power Act in 1935 and that Congress deliberately decided not to expand Commission licensing jurisdiction at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.679" offset="2838131">This is recounted in some detail, this portion of the legislative history on page 8 of the reply brief filed by the intervenor companies.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="875.473" offset="3605295">It's much closer to the project work's jurisdiction and the basic motivation for it, as power consumption and power needs are expanding so rapidly is a concern on the part of the Commission for adequacy and reliability of power service.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.949" offset="3675199">At present, there is no agency which has centralized authority to consider alternative sites for new thermal plants and to authorize a particular site to the exclusion of any other regulatory jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.947" offset="3743117">As a result, you got seriatim litigation about the siting of thermal projects which can result in considerable delay in the construction of needed facilities with the risk of brownouts and blackouts.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.508" offset="3809364">Under the Court of Appeals' holding, the Commission would not have authority in authorizing the use of surplus water to preempt other regulatory agency, state or federal from the siting question, it would merely be an additional obstacle that would have to be overcome to the resolution of where particular plant that's needed can be built.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.322" offset="3912704">So we wouldn't be having a resolution of what the Commission sees as needed under the surplus water clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.524" offset="3953455">I should turn, since I think the legislative history is quite clear with respect to the first part of the Court of Appeals opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.179" offset="3988041">I should turn to their holding on the surplus water clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.178" offset="4008103">The first thing to be said about it is that most of the legislative history applies equally to the surplus water clause which was in the Act from the outset and which was included in the Commission's generic reports that it lacks a jurisdiction over thermal-electric facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.452" offset="4097128">Sometimes the reports would specify under part one of the Federal Power Act which was obviously included the surplus water clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.500" offset="4133386">Indeed, if and the Court of Appeals of course did not have the benefit of the very compendious history of that particular clause which the intervenors have compiled in their supplemental brief which is very helpful in showing the antecedence of the clause which indicate that it was tied in very specifically with hydroelectric development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.964" offset="4239235">The other thing in our view may have mislead the Court of Appeals on this question is the fact that the litigation focused so much on Section 4 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.031" offset="4283538">In the appendix in our brief on page 63, we have set forth Section 23 (b) of the Act which probably is the Section of the complaint should have been brought under because that is the Section that says who is required to get a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.648" offset="4365981">Section 4 (e) simply says what authority the Commission has to issue a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.742" offset="4390327">Obviously, the two have to be read together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.150" offset="4399940">But Section 23 (b) on page 63 indicates quite clearly on the face of the Act that there is very little warrant for reading the two clauses differently since it says it shall be unlawful for any person, state or municipality for the purpose of developing electric power to construct project works or to use surplus water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.293" offset="4516551">And it's rather hard to see why the words for the purpose of developing electric power would not be read the same with respect to both clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.611" offset="4553853">It's the operational words that, in light of the legislative background indicate a limitation of the Commission's jurisdiction to hydroelectric facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.841" offset="4606725">Now, the argument is made that under this reading of Section 23 (b) and of the similar authority in Section 4 (e), the surplus water clause becomes redundant and superfluous and loses any function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.948" offset="4687182">In reflecting on this matter in preparing the argument, the things to ask that the most apparent function of the surplus water clause on the face of the Act, again is reflected in Section 23 (b) on which the litigation did not focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.957" offset="4759176">And I'm sorry this point was not made in the briefs but its there on the face of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.038" offset="4787493">And that is the fact that Section 23 (b) has a grandfathering provision for any facilities that were built under a grant prior to June 10, 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.567" offset="4857605">That would by enlarge statutory grants, special statutory grants for existing facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.424" offset="4889057">And the Commission -- on the Commission's long standing position endorsed by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in a case called Northwest Paper Company against the Power Commission, 344 F.2d 47 is that the grandfathering clause is an authorization for facilities existing at that date to continue operation without a license from the Commission so long as none of the projects works a replace without a license under the project works clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.735" offset="5050284">But then in the event and the Commission has not had occasion to actually apply this in the event the dam would be built subsequently upstream from which surplus water would flow to this project, there would be Commission jurisdiction only under the surplus water clause so that the entire river system would be brought under regulation to maximize the hydroelectric potential of the entire system because obviously the flow has to be regulated from one project to another to maximize the utilization of all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.793" offset="5202526">And similarly, the surplus water or water power seems to us just to refer to either the use of the surplus water or water power seems to us just to refer to either the use of the surplus water downstream or the surplus water power at the site where it is falling, the dam itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1793.804" offset="7278634">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.104" offset="7287829">My name is Joe Brecher representing the Chemehuevi Tribe of Indians, the Sierra Club, several individual in Navajo and the Committee to Save Black Mesa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.690" offset="7330147">This case involves perhaps the quintessential environmental nightmare that this country has experienced in the Four Corners power plants and the Black Mesa strip-mining operation and that involves also a context of one of the most blatant calls for judicial legislation I have ever witnessed on the part of the power companies and the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.860" offset="7406843">The language of the statute involved here could be no more clear that the facilities involved in this case are covered by Section 4 (e) of the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.215" offset="7444250">There could be no doubt that they are utilizing surplus water from a government dam for the purpose of producing electric power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.970" offset="7475284">And I would like to emphasize this point at the outset that this is not merely cooling water in the same sense that water and then automobile radiator cools the engine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.148" offset="7511960">The water that's used in the thermal-electric power plant is an essential part of the power production process itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.741" offset="7538291">Without the cooling water, power production at these plants would go down 20 or more percent, the plants would be inefficient and they could not be built.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.781" offset="7570474">So the water used in the thermal plants involved in this case is an inherent part of the production process and therefore in a very real sense, this water is being used to produce electric power rather than to cool machines, which are producing power by other means.</text>

            <text syncTime="2008.539" offset="8137540">And if that water were to be released to the stream in addition to the thermal problem, which what you have recognized, it would also be a problem of increased salinity in the river.</text>

            <text syncTime="2095.797" offset="8486536">And this is true not only on the Colorado but on the Yellow Stone River in Montana which is another major energy complex source which will soon have problems very similar to the Colorado River.</text>

            <text syncTime="2128.635" offset="8617880">This problem is in its infancy and we are seeing the first flash of it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.079" offset="8639718">Now I mentioned the fact the power companies and the Government are arguing flagrantly judicial legislation, and this is what they argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.978" offset="8675244">Although the literal language of the statute quite obviously covers the facilities involved here, there should be run in to the statute a proviso that says none of these language shall apply to steam or thermal-electric power plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.464" offset="8729266">What is the basis for this additional language which they claim should be involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.160" offset="8747969">No canon of statutory construction that I know of allows it and in fact several important canons to which this court has long adhered would militate against the addition of this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.912" offset="8791019">First, there is the plain meaning rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.363" offset="8800841">Now the plain meaning rule is based on very sound traditions of a judicial construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.413" offset="8829053">First, the language of a statute should be understandable to, and accessible by the common man and the common lawyer I may add.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.913" offset="8866983">The material which is relied on here to vary that meaning as Mr. Justice Jackson pointed out eloquently throughout his career in this Court is available only to a few legal specialists located in the larger cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.790" offset="8918497">I myself had a very difficult time working in Denver of getting my hands on the material which is cited in the supplement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.288" offset="8944515">And what -- if the plain meaning rule is buried in this way, it means not only a few specialists are going to be able to interpret the statute which originally was designed to aid the public to be understandable by the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.775" offset="9002506">And we don't claim that the plain meaning rule should govern overall sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.573" offset="9021628">Obviously, if the literal language of the statute is completely in variance with what the framers of the statute had in mind or if it would lead to absurd or impractical consequences, then we must explicate the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.646" offset="9073977">We must go behind to see what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.565" offset="9085680">And indeed, this Court has recognized that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.043" offset="9095502">But that is a very narrow exception to a very well-established rule and we maintain that in this present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.448" offset="9121207">There is no reason for applying that exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.229" offset="9132283">Obviously, we do not have an absurd or impractical consequence by giving the Federal Power Commission jurisdiction either under the surplus water clause or under the project works clause over steam power plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.787" offset="9182542">In fact, the Commission itself was asked for this jurisdiction repeatedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.221" offset="9196231">So it certainly would not be absurd and it is certainly would not be impractical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.189" offset="9212113">And indeed, the Commission has stated that based on what it conceives as its present statutory mandate, this additional activity would fit in well, would complement itself well with the statutory mandated as it now exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.780" offset="9262477">Now, do we have -- if steam plant licensing were allowed, do we have a situation where the purposes of the Act would violated or a violence would be done to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.570" offset="9305631">Again no, because one of the -- perhaps the primary purpose of the Act as mentioned by the power companies and the Government was to promote hydroelectric development and we do not quarrel with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.542" offset="9349517">We do believe that hydroelectric development was upper most in the minds of Congress when they enacted the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.435" offset="9377102">But there are other social phenomena that they attempted to take care of in the very same legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.839" offset="9402702">Several threads of thought that conservation is in the early 1900's had been working on came together in the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.571" offset="9433631">And two other purposes should be borne in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.027" offset="9447528">First, was a general purpose to achieve comprehensive development of the nation's waterways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.116" offset="9475845">Indeed, one of the immediate statutory antecedence of the Federal Power Act was an Act creating a Waterways Commission to unify the development of our rivers for purposes having nothing to do with power, having to do with irrigation and other uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.726" offset="9542301">And although we do not contend that the Federal Power Act deals with the use water for other than power production purposes, they are definitely it was the sense of Congress that unified development of the nation's waterways was an important purpose of the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.274" offset="9608443">The second important purpose was to make sure that private power companies were not allowed to appropriate for themselves without the Government's supervision and inappropriate cases without appropriate charges, the power potential and navigable streams.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.418" offset="9673017">In the present case in order to effectuate those two purposes behind the Federal Power Act, that is comprehensive development of waterways and making sure that the public's property was protected, regulation of thermal power plants is absolutely essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.899" offset="9731009">There is going to be a no more hydroelectric development in this country of any consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.684" offset="9750131">And the waterways of this country used in connection with power will be used only in connection with thermal plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.893" offset="9774895">If the construction argued for by the power companies and the Government is allowed to continue, the power companies will have achieve by the backdoor, what the Congress had setout to stop them from doing in 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.905" offset="9827035">That is appropriating for themselves without any Government supervision or control, the hydro potential in navigable streams.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.244" offset="9856397">They will do that by sucking all the water out of the river and not making it available for downstream dams.</text>

            <text syncTime="2556.631" offset="10329945">There is no public participation for example in a decision by the Secretary to allocate water.</text>

            <text syncTime="2574.390" offset="10400893">In contrast before the Federal Power Commission, the public has very well-defined rights to participate in the proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2926.262" offset="11808371">Now when we turn to the legislative history, which is suppose to preclude the plain meaning of the statute, we find that that history consist of a negative rather than a positive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.141" offset="11847973">Nowhere have they pointed to a single instance in which any member of Congress said that steam plants are not be licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.275" offset="11880469">Instead, they point to the fact that steam plants were not mentioned, or if they were, they were mentioned in other context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.912" offset="11907009">And they draw from the inference that therefore, steam plants are not to be licensed under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.213" offset="11932191">We believe that this violates a premise that Chief Justice Marshall stated way back in the 1830's which is, that if you have a situation that appears to be covered by statutory language and that particular situation was not mentioned by Congress, it is not enough to say that it was not mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.684" offset="12018082">There must be an affirmative showing that Congress had it been confronted with the facts involved in the case would have said, “No, we do not want to regulate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.869" offset="12050892">Now I would like to ask this court to imagine the conservation this Congress of 1919 and 1920 being confronted with the Kaiparowits power plant using a 102,000 acre feet of scarce Colorado River water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.656" offset="12110033">Water which would then not be available at four downstream hydro -- federal hydroelectric projects, water which would be depleted forever from the river system, water which would be necessary for the intelligent planning of that system.</text>

            <text syncTime="3036.211" offset="12248168">And I maintain that we cannot say on the strength of the legislative history that's been offered to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.699" offset="12274186">Now, it's argued that the Secretary's power on the Colorado River supersedes any power that the Federal Power Commission could have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.921" offset="12303026">We believe that this is the weakest argument that has been advanced by the power companies for number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.795" offset="12322565">One, the two main statutes relied on by them, the Boulder Canyon Project Act and the Colorado River Storage Project Act, both take away FPC jurisdiction either for a limited time on the Colorado or for a limited space on the Colorado, but by implication would retain jurisdiction on the rest of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.106" offset="12399783">The Boulder Canyon Project Act says that the Commission's jurisdiction on the Colorado shall temporarily seize until the Act shall have been ratified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.043" offset="12439594">That Act of course was ratified in 1921 and so by implication FPC jurisdiction continues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.858" offset="12466761">In the Colorado River Storage Project Act, the Congress went to the trouble of excluding FPC jurisdiction on a short stretch of the river between the Grand Canyon and Lake Mead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.810" offset="12506572">If there were no jurisdiction there originally, why would it be necessary to take the jurisdiction away in the statutory contract -- context?</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.592" offset="12537710">Furthermore, the Commission itself has held hearings, licensing hearings and those hearings have been participated in by the Secretary concerning this very portion the Colorado River involved here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3143.160" offset="12676054">Furthermore, even if we are to accept this argument, two of the power plants involved in this case, the Four Corners and Huntington Canyon plants are not covered by the contracts of the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.437" offset="12721089">They do not have water service contracts with the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.135" offset="12735927">They have obtained their water by the usual method from the states involved so that the Secretary's jurisdiction, even if it existed could not supersede FPC jurisdiction as to those two power plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.852" offset="12782738">In short, there is very -- and finally, I may add, if this court looks at the Nantahala power case, which involved the TVA and the Federal Power Commission; we had a situation very similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.309" offset="12832580">As you are aware, the Tennessee Valley authority has very, very broad authority over the allocation and distribution of water in the Tennessee Valley.</text>

            <text syncTime="3196.498" offset="12889318">Nonetheless, it was held in the Nantahala power case that the Federal Power Commission still had a voice in deciding the allocation of that water, at least as far power plants are concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="3847.553" offset="15493622">If it was used by from wells, you don't get under the authority of a Federal Water Power Act and consequently the fact that cooling water is taken here from a navigable stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.538" offset="15545553">It's a far-fetched detour to say that this tiny use of cooling water somehow four miles by plant, four miles from a stream somehow brings that by the intent of Congress into the scope of an Act intended to regulate water power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.506" offset="15605426">As this both the majority and minority pointed in the Taum Sauk case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3879.872" offset="15622875">You're dealing with the Federal Power Act with the hydroelectric potential in falling water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.526" offset="15641475">And the teaching of the Taum Sauk case is it makes no difference, whether water comes to the head of the penstocks by nature or by active man through a pump, it's a falling water.</text>

            <label>Mr. Northcutt Ely</label>
            <text syncTime="3896.106" offset="15687764">And we think Your Honor that that case controls this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.665" offset="15698004">You cannot reach your contrary conclusion here on the licensing of steam plants without abandoning the rational of the majority opinion written by Mr. Justice White nor the minority opinion of Mr. Justice Goldberg in which Mr. Justice Stewart joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.059" offset="15763623">There is a logical difference between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.377" offset="15772923">Congress legislated in one field but not the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3920.304" offset="15784626">And the arguments made here might very appropriately be made to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.529" offset="15797478">Opinion might well differ.</text>
            <text syncTime="3925.094" offset="15803747">The many parties should be heard there who are not here in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.898" offset="15822973">One final point, complaint was made that in 1968, Congress had enact in the Colorado River Project Act placed an embargo upon the licensing of projects between Grand Canyon Dam and Hoover Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3943.046" offset="15875532">So it did but these were hydroelectric projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.348" offset="15888802">The projects that Bridge Canyon or Marble Canyon that had been intended to provide power for the Central Arizona project and cash registers to help finance it and that the Sierra Club and other conservations opposed and said, “No, use thermal power for this pumping.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.467" offset="15949197">Whereupon Congress put in to the 1968 Act authority for the Secretary to buy an interest in the plant attacked here, the Navajo plant on Lake Powell and the United States has appropriated some $200 million to buy a 24% interest in that plant to pump water into the Central Arizona Aqueduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.464" offset="16021191">That is one of the plants that our opponents now say that would have to be licensed, not withstanding this Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.834" offset="16046686">As the Four Corners plant, it is below the Navajo Dam on the San Juan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.974" offset="16071241">An Act of Congress in 1962 said, “Not only that you must have a contract to take water from that dam, but if yours is a long-term contract, it must be validated by special Act of Congress.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.869" offset="16118888">Consequently, one plant below the Navajo Dam does have such a contract, it was validated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4009.587" offset="16141772">If the Four Corners plant is found indeed to be using water out of that stream instead of under state law appropriations, it must get a contract which must go to Congress for approval and the Federal Power Commission cannot grant it by a surplus water license.</text>
