            <label>Mr. John P. Rupp</label>
            <text syncTime="37.708" offset="254203">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.821" offset="266637">This case is here on a government's petition for certiorari to review a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.631" offset="293909">This sole question presented by the petition was whether the Admiralty Rule applied to mutual fault collision cases of dividing damages equally, should be replaced by a rule apportioning damages in proportion to fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.246" offset="348348">The facts necessary to provide a context for consideration of this question are few, and are rather fully set forth in the government's brief on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.553" offset="385546">Briefly on the evening of December 23, 1968, respondent's tanker the Mary A. Whalen, left Constable Hook, New Jersey in heavy winds and high seas bound for Island Park, New York with a load of fuel oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.806" offset="454614">During the course of the passage, the vessel became stranded to the west of an inoperative breakwater light, on promontory known as Rockaway Point.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.689" offset="510098">After a trial that lasted for several days, the District Court held that although the Coast Guard had been at fault in failing to complete repairs on the breakwater light earlier, the fault of the captain and crew of the Mary. A. Whalen, respondent's vessel, had been far more egregious.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.093" offset="583764">Specifically the Court found that the stranding was due 25% to the negligence of the Coast Guard, the fault of the Coast Guard, and 75%, to the negligence of the Captain and crew of the Whalen.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.565" offset="645622">Despite the fact that the Court found the respective faults of the parties to have been disparate, and after having observed that while a Division of Damages in proportionate to fault might be more equitable in this case, the Court nevertheless applied the divided damages rule or ordered that the damage hearing beheld in which a divided damages rule would be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.100" offset="723780">The Court of Appeals affirmed, stating that so far as negligence was concerned, the vessel's claim that it was not at fault borders on the frivolous and with respect to remedy, that it was powerless to divide the damages other than equally, even though it recognized the force of the argument that in a case of this sort, an unequal proportional division of damages would be more equitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.332" offset="832658">Although respondent chose not to file a cross petition in this case, it nonetheless sought in its opposition to the government's petition for certiorari, and in its brief on the merits to raise an issue entirely separate from the issue of divided damages, with respect to which the government petitioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.483" offset="909354">That issue is whether the courts below correctly apportioned fault between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.877" offset="934849">In its brief in opposition, the thrust of the arguments made by respondent were that -- were to the effect that this case is an inappropriate vehicle for reconsideration by this Court of the divided damages rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.697" offset="990124">In its brief on the merits, the argument appears to be that the courts below, the factual findings of the courts below found by the District Court, and affirmed by the Court of Appeals were incorrect, they are seeking a de novo reweighing of those findings by this Court ultimately for a vacating of the judgment below, and a remand to the court with instructions to direct an increase in the judgment in its favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.975" offset="1095241">The contention that respondent need not cross petition on an issue, such as this I think the cases of this Court relatively clearly answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.938" offset="1147173">The general rule was perhaps most clearly stated I think in Lang versus Green, and the holding in that case has been approved and extended to some extent in a number of recent cases, including this Court's recent decision in ITT versus Continental Baking.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.831" offset="1214673">I should note additionally, since there appears to be a misapprehension on this point, on the part of respondent, that the present case is very much unlike Union Oil Company versus the San Jacinto, the case which this Court took a couple of years ago, to consider the continuing vitality of the divided damages rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.740" offset="1302340">In that case, petitioner both petitioned, presented the question of whether the finding a fault below was proper, and secondly, so far as the respective negligence of the parties was concerned, the dispute there involved the dispute over a question of law, and not an issue of fact which is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.462" offset="1409233">Unlike the situation with which this Court was presented in the San Jacinto then, this case presents in clear and uncomplicated form, the continuing vitality of the divided damages rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.884" offset="1458866">In our briefs on the merits we attempted to set out in some detail the historical antecedence of the divided damages rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.532" offset="1485511">As noted there, the rule can be traced with some assurance to rules of admiralty which once prevailed in England and France, and in most other major maritime nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.400" offset="1520933">Originally the rule was primarily or rather exclusively a risk sharing device.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.994" offset="1555310">In the middle of the 16th Century however, with the development of negligence concepts, particularly in English Jurisprudence, the rationale of the rule began to undergo a continuing process of erosion, a process which I would suggest has continued to this day.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.962" offset="1615182">By the first quarter of the 19th Century, application of the rule was restricted to cases in England, to cases of sole fault, and was expressly inapplicable, pursuant to the decision of the House of Lords in Hay versus Le Neve, inapplicable to cases of sole fault to cases of inevitable accident, and the cases of inscrutable fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.761" offset="1710373">Inevitable accident, that is those cases of collisions resulting from such things as acts of God, an inscrutable fault, where fault cannot be -- precise locus of fault could not be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.853" offset="1766797">The first case decided by this Court applying the divided damages rule, that is the first case in which the issue was squarely presented for decision, was The Schooner Catharine which was decided by this Court in 1854.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.621" offset="1817893">From the opinion in that case and subsequent cases, it's relatively clear that the rule was adapted by this Court for at least three relatively distinct reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.095" offset="1863764">First, because of the assumed difficulty of courts in apportioning damages other than equally in mutual fault collision cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.794" offset="1894588">Secondly, because it was hoped that the rule would induce a greater degree of care and navigation, and finally because of this Court's [Inaudible] in applying a doctrine of bar of contributory negligence in cases of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.672" offset="1958013">We submit that none of these considerations carries much weight today, but that the later rational is particularly instructive, that is that the divided damages rule represents an improvement over the common law bar of contributory negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.012" offset="2023424">This Court's refusal to import into admiralty law, the common law principle of contributory negligence, is a reflection of this court's inherent power often affirmed to give and withhold damages in admiralty cases upon the large principles of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.344" offset="2084760">Perhaps no where in the admiralty law has this principle been more uniformly followed than in cases involving personal injury or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.589" offset="2125720">Even before this Court's decision in the Max Morris in 1890, lower courts were apportioning damages in collisions -- in accidents, subject to admiralty law, accidents involving personal injury, proportionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.986" offset="2191339">The Court in The Max Morris did not specifically address that issue, or did not decide that issue, although its decision in that case speeded that development.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.617" offset="2225821">Over time the remedy of proportional damages has become coterminous with the substantive rights of people to maintain causes of action in admiralty for personal injury and death.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.155" offset="2275976">That development has been specifically approved by Congress of course in the Jones Act, and implemented by Congress in the Jones Act, in the Death on the High Seas Act as well as others.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.529" offset="2309517">So, as far as property damage is concerned however, a number of commentators, notably among them, Gilmore and Black, have suggested that it is far from clear that replacing a bar of contributory negligence in mutual fault collision cases, represents an improvement over the bar of contributory negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.262" offset="2384436">The capacity of the rule to produce inequitable results is I think amply demonstrated by the facts of the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.185" offset="2416097">The Government in this case was found to have been 25% at fault, because of its failure to repair the Rockaway Point breakwater light more speedily.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.385" offset="2456952">Yet, under the divided damages rule, it's liable for 50% of the total damages suffered in the stranding of the Whalen.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.923" offset="2491016">Under the doctrine of contributory negligence, the Government would be immune from any liability in this case, even though it was found it would have been 25% at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.145" offset="2527901">In the first case, under the divided damages rule, the windfall is in the favor of the respondent.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="613.163" offset="2556008">Was there any damage to light or was it just to the tanker?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_p_rupp" startTime="616.201" stopTime="932.372">
            <label>Mr. John P. Rupp</label>
            <text syncTime="616.201" offset="2568129">I think there was no damage to the light.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.997" offset="2583385">I think all of the damage in the case, occasioned by the stranding was caused to the vessel, and its cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.111" offset="2611806">In the one case, the windfall is 25% in respondent's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.680" offset="2638137">If a contributory negligence doctrine were applied in this area, the windfall would be 25% in the government's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.882" offset="2674918">The gap between what is equitable in cases of this sort, and the result produced by application of the divided damages rule, I think becomes clearest, in cases which involves statutory fault, and the doctrine of statutory fault, of course emanates from this Court's decision in the Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.946" offset="2751195">The rule of the Pennsylvania, is that the party to a collision, guilty of a statutory violation must prove not merely that its fault might not have been one of the causes of the collision, or that it probably was not, but that it could not have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.374" offset="2812844">This is a burden seldom carried in practice, with result that parties guilty of simply a technical violation, all -- often find themselves condemned to pay 50% of the damage by virtue of the joint operation of the rule of Pennsylvania, and the divided damages rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.964" offset="2887241">Not surprisingly, the number of such cases have widely disparate fault covered by the divided damages rule has increased in rough proportion to the proliferation of rules of navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.148" offset="2935933">Presently there are four sets of rules of navigation provided by Federal Statute; the International rules, the Great Lakes rules, the Inland rules and a Western River rules, as well as three sets of pilot rules and regulations issued by the Coast Guards in state and local statutes and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.880" offset="3006882">At pages 17 and18 of our brief, we sketch the procedures generally applicable to admiralty cases involving collisions, procedures which I think, put in some perspective the scope and the intensity of the criticism that over time has been directed at application of the divided damages rule and mutual fault collisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.131" offset="3091937">As we indicated there, while the inequity of the divided damages rule is often shielded to some extent from public scrutiny, there has been an increasing and substantial amount of public criticism, particularly in recent years, concerning application of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.140" offset="3155884">Indeed our research in this case has not turned up a single commentator, it was a proof continue application of the divided damages rule and I hasten to add that that does not mean that there are none, I simply haven't found one.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.273" offset="3208443">Perhaps the most telling criticism of the rule, and the principle reason that the government is here today, requesting that it be abrogated in favor of the proportional fault rule, is that the United States today stands alone among the major maritime nations of the world, in applying a divided damages rule in mutual fault collision cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.932" offset="3291094">This fact I think is significant for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.565" offset="3305618">First, it provides rather conclusive support from the view, for the view rather, that there is a readily available and workable alternative to the rule of divided damages, namely, the proportional fault rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.598" offset="3357759">Second, the isolated maintenance, the divided damage rule in this country, has the inevitable affect of encouraging transoceanic forum shopping, a point which is made, I think most clearly in Gilmore and Black [Inaudible].</text>
            <text syncTime="828.218" offset="3416273">Third, the fact that the United States alone applies a rule of divided damages, introduces in the International Maritime Commerce, a good deal of unpredictability, and I think in a necessary amount of unpredictability.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.193" offset="3468100">This Court, we submit, has already recognized the, implicitly recognized the unfairness of the divided damages rule, at least in the most extreme case of disparate fault, by creation of a so called major-minor fault exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.167" offset="3528077">The major-minor fault rule stems from this court's decision in the City of New York and the Umbria.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.231" offset="3552319">The rule we stated in the City of New York is as follows: where fault on the part of one vessel is of itself, sufficient to account for the disaster.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.900" offset="3582934">Any reasonable doubt with regards to the propriety of the conduct of such other vessel, should be resolved in the other vessel's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.517" offset="3617416">As noted at pages 24 and 25 of our brief, the major-minor fault rule has proven extremely difficult to apply in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.057" offset="3667571">One of the problems of the rule is that, it encourages courts to avoid a full and fair consideration of cases on its merits, in cases where the fault is obviously disparate.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.882" offset="3734862">More importantly, I think however, is the fact that the major-minor fault rule itself involves inequity, that is, it absolves parties from fault even though, excuse me, it absolves parties from liability, from paying damages, even though found to have been at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.841" offset="3802781">The rule is I think then to that extent, but a variation of the contributorily negligence doctrine.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="932.372" offset="3832874">Well, doesn't the divided damages rule at least make it easier to settle these cases so there is less judicial time taken up with trying to figure out whether you are 65% at fault or 35% at fault?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. John P. Rupp</label>
            <text syncTime="944.721" offset="3882297">That was a point which was discussed at some length, I recall in the briefs filed in San Jacinto.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.136" offset="3903927">I think that's not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.123" offset="3919914">If a party is involved in a collision in which his fault is minor, and the lion's share of the damage occurs to the other vessel, there is every motivation not to settle, because not to settle, both gives the relatively less negligent party a shot at the major-minor fault rule, and also stays the day which there is going to have to be a substantial payment; to be more negligent relatively greater damaged vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.280" offset="4068498">I think the best -- the most that can be said, is that whether damages would be encouraged or discouraged relatively, by moving to a proportional fault rule, is specular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.641" offset="4145925">I conceive as and I gave you an example of the case in which the opposite would be the case, my point I am sure can suggest any cool number of cases in which a divided damages rule would encourage settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.916" offset="4203081">But I think that my own view is that the court --- this Court ought not to approve a rule which encourages settlements which are unfair, which is something that divided damages rule does, that is if --</text>

            <text syncTime="1047.425" offset="4293047">That's right, that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.311" offset="4304645">Now, while the Court need not necessarily reach the issue in this case, we would suggest that the major-minor fault rule is itself badly in need of reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.477" offset="4337246">If the rule of proportional fault is adopted as we suggest, I see little residual need left for the major-minor fault rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.711" offset="4366190">And that rule has masqueraded under various other names as well, it's called Glossing in some courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.964" offset="4391267">Other courts says analyze fault in terms of their active or passive characteristics, in cases in which the fault is obviously disparate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.697" offset="4434108">The opportunity to move away from the major-minor fault rule, I think represents a major advantage of a proportional fault rule, and people like Black and Gilmore, and Judge Friendly in the Second Circuit agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.290" offset="4480502">It's important to be clearly understood that the government is not in this case asking the Court to do the Congress' work, and to ratify the Brussels Convention of 1912.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.247" offset="4524387">It is true that part of the explanation for the failure of the convention to be ratified, is the fact that various of its provisions have been opposed by specific interest groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.437" offset="4569109">That opposition has not however, been directed at the proportional fault rule, which appears in paragraph 1 of Article 4, of the Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.395" offset="4596903">It has instead been directed at other provisions of the convention which are severable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.012" offset="4619368">Cargo interest, for example, have vigorously opposed the elimination in paragraph 2 of Article 4 of the Convention of joint and several liability in the event of a collision, contending I think, with some justification that such a change in their substantive right to recover should be effective if at all, by the legislative process, rather than by treaty ratification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.250" offset="4700348">A number of other groups have proposed Article 6 which eliminates legal presumptions of fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.043" offset="4723545">Congress' failure to replace the divided damages rule with the proportional fault rule in the face of the almost unanimous support for that course evidenced during the hearings in Brussels Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.530" offset="4765445">Simply means we would suggest that the responsibility for the rule has remained where it began with this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.266" offset="4796479">As this Court stated in a not dissimilar context in Moragne versus States Lines, we do not think that Congress' failure to take action on depending bail or to pass a similar measure over the years as the law of deaths on territorial waters became more in Congress, provides guidance for the course that we should take in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.583" offset="4869726">To conclude the Congress by not legislating on this subject, it has an affect foreclosed by negative legislation as it were, reconsideration of prior judicial doctrine would be to disregard the fact that Congress has already left in this Court the responsibility for fashioning the controlling rules of admiralty law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.862" offset="4938794">I think that applies with equal force here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.947" offset="4951124">We are satisfied moreover that there no impediments to adoption of the Proportional Fault rule by this Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.347" offset="4980799">Although the rule of divided damages has been applied in this country for over a hundred years, it is becoming increasingly anomalous over time, and the reasons originally invoked in support of it have become increasingly unpersuasive I would suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.287" offset="5040567">It seems a little late to argue for example, that courts will prove incapable of applying a Doctrine of Comparative Negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.813" offset="5074631">Contrary is proven to have been the case in all other places in the World where the Proportional Fault rule has been adopted by Treaty or by Judicial Decisions, and courts in this country have long been become accustomed to applying Proportional Fault rules as well, and have been proven capable of doing so more particularly in Admiralty where personal injuries have been involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.610" offset="5181837">If mathematical certitude is not possible, Gilmore &amp; Black are nevertheless surely correct in suggesting that the Proportional Fault rule would at least not be designed to go wrong in as many cases as the divided damages rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.210" offset="5240247">It does repeating in addition I think, that we are not asking in this case for the abrogation of the divided damages -- of divided damages, or fifty-fifty division of damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1401.953" offset="5711182">I think that that argument fails for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.739" offset="5734379">One, is that the only problem in that respect, if it is a problem, when we contend that it is not, stems from this Court's decision in the Chattahoochee in 1899, the Harter Act was passed in 1893.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.074" offset="5787669">The Harter Act generally with a number of exceptions released from direct suit, the carrying vessel for damage to cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.526" offset="5841481">In the Chattahoochee, this Court decided that Congress did not mean by the Harter Act to effect the relationship between one vessel and another, or in a case of this sort, between the United States and the Carrying Vessel, and I think the same result, I think that that decision was correct, and the court has I should point out reached the same result in cases arising under the Workers and Longshoreman Compensation Act in Admiralty, as well under other statutes, Workmen Compensation type statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.341" offset="6000724">There is no evidence in the legislative history of either the Harter Act or the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.225" offset="6020263">The Congress meant to remove from this Court its historical discretion to enforce rules which go to remedy in Admiralty, I see no inconsistency with the Harter Act, and the course of the government is asking this Court to take in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1868.205" offset="7576221">I think that the United States stands alone as stated by my friend here, because Congress has chosen to retain the rule as is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.768" offset="7614464">It's had ample opportunity to either confirm the Brussels Convention or to adopt a statute which would incorporate the rule in respect to divided the damages.</text>

            <label>Mr. Copal Mintz</label>
            <text syncTime="1892.802" offset="7674546">I doubt it very much, because Congress has been very active in legislating in this area, the admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.702" offset="7698160">It's adopted any number of statutes, and to assume that Congress has not taken up this out of [Inaudible] it seems to me, it isn't being unfair to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.050" offset="7743613">I think it's more fair to say that Congress has decided the rule as is is better than proposed one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.902" offset="7774960">I would like to now go to my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.541" offset="7789484">Contrary to the contentions that have been made by my friend, I think the issues here still are; one, is this case an inappropriate basis for the reconsideration of the divided damage rule?</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.290" offset="7836505">I will elaborate on that in just a minute, but in the meantime, I want to set forth the other merits, issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.960" offset="7867225">Two, is this Court the appropriate forum or body to consider changing the rule, or should it be left to Congress?</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.254" offset="7896377">And three, on the merits of the rule, and of the alternative fair to urged by petitioner, is the latter equitable, more logical, more practical, and thus more desirable than the present rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.176" offset="7948100">I now suggest that the government must prevail on each of these issues in order to be entitled to a judgment in its favor from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.753" offset="7982373">Now on the first issue, there is no finding really of 25% and 75%, that's an adjudication, it's a judgment, so expressed by Judge Judd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.123" offset="8031901">He said, “It's difficult to arrive at mathematical determinations, and on all the evidence I conclude that 25% and 75% is fair --</text>

            <text syncTime="1993.112" offset="8075786">Well, you would agree I think, that in some cases, it's more readily done than in others?</text>

            <label>Mr. Copal Mintz</label>
            <text syncTime="2002.147" offset="8111940">Yes, and in those cases where it's evident that one is very slightly at fault, then you don't give him a recovery, and you don't hold him liable, I should say don't hold him liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.016" offset="8179440">But where have you come to, how does one say it's 25, and not 30, not 35, it's 75, not 65, and all that, what basis is that to make those determinations as far as the fault is concerned, beyond that I suggest, that's irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.388" offset="8240880">Because where you have a situation, where but for the negligence of both, there would be no accidents then it's irrelevant, whether the contribution of one or the others, 25 or 75, whatever the ratio maybe, if he hadn't been at fault, there would have been no accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.746" offset="8318307">Therefore, why should he not share in the damage, because that is the result of the co-negligence of both parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.056" offset="8351640">Now here on more over, the government has been guilty of a statutory violation for over 24 hours has left that light unlit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.436" offset="8397093">It knew it, it had notice on it, and under the rules that my friend has cited this Court has several times decided that where the cause of a disaster or accident is a violation of a statutory duty, that then it bares the entire liability, unless it's conclusively demonstrated, and that it wasn't the sole cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.627" offset="8501896">So we have here prima facie case where sole cause was the government's and yet Judge Judd's finding that the accident would not have occurred, that is the finding of the fact, that the accident would not have occurred, and the damages would not have been sustained if the light had not been burning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.401" offset="8584965">So we have here a straightforward finding which brings it into play the rule that I have just adverted to, and that my friend adverted to, that where the negligence consists of violation of a statutory duty, the violator bears the entire brunt of the damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.344" offset="8656750">So that here we have a case which under normal rules, would have resulted -- by application of the normal rules would have resulted in the finding that the government is liable for the entire damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.086" offset="8703666">And yet we have asked here to -- the Court is asked here to make a determination nevertheless, the damages should remain apportioned or should be apportioned, 75 to the government -- I mean 25 to the government, and 75 to the vessel, which I think is a gross injustice, and which I think illustrates that the rule for which the government is now asking is really an unfair rule, and I --</text>

            <text syncTime="2537.817" offset="10254608">I am glad Your Honor I feel that there is an inconsistency, but it has been my argument all along that you can't put the two together and justify both of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.585" offset="10293687">And for the Court of Appeals to have said that we bordered on the frivolous, and arguing that, I would like to say, if I may, that attending recently a session of the Court of Appeals where applications for parole after conviction pending appeal, the arguments was always made -- the trial judge said that was a frivolous appeal, and one of the justices answered, well -- he remembers that when he was a District Judge, he regarded many applications for bail as being frivolous, but now that he is on the Court of Appeals, he has a different view of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.304" offset="10452616">So I think that applies to the statement that borders on the frivolous when we have a situation of the kind Your Honor has just pointed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.428" offset="10497128">Now, assuming that we have here a split liability case or a split fault case, the question then is, should to this Court reconsider the rule?</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.774" offset="10574451">Now this has been a rule of this Court since 1843.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.412" offset="10600991">It has been mentioned and repeatedly discussed and repeatedly sustained in a number of cases, and I can roll them off, Catharine v. Dickinson, 17 How in 1943, The North Star in 1882, The Max Morris in 1890, The Chattahoochee in 1899, The Eugene Moran in 1909, White Oak Transportation in 1922, Weyerhaeuser in 1963, and just recently a few years ago, Cooper Stevedoring versus Kopke in 1974, where in opinion by Judge Marshall, there was express approval of the rule although he did make a footnote that you are not called upon to reconsider it, because there was no finding that had to be reviewed or something to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.608" offset="10849782">And we also have the fact that we had the Brussels Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.240" offset="10876322">It had been submitted to Congress for ratification; Congress failed, has failed continually.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.891" offset="10906937">There has been no pressure for Congress to go ahead, and for this Court to undertake to refashion the rule, which has been in existence for so many years, and has been repeatedly [Inaudible], taken into account, it seems to me is rather inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.637" offset="10985932">I suggest that if this is really legislation and not adjudication, and it's more more properly in the area of Congress, than the area of the Judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.200" offset="11032221">To be sure, there have been have many commentators who have said that -- have found fault with the rule, including among them very eminent jurists, but that in of itself is not sufficient, because there is always disagreements among lawyers and among judges on various phases of the law, and that doesn't mean that the courts refashion the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.745" offset="11130337">I am not suggesting that the Court is without power to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.445" offset="11145174">I am suggesting that under the circumstances of this case, where there has been -- where the history is as it is, it would be inappropriate for this Court to undertake to do the work which Congress should do, and which it has refused to do indicating that it is quite content to let the rule stay as it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.954" offset="11247156">Now, on the merits of the rule, I think I indicated to some extent my thinking on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.494" offset="11285400">I think that where an accident is the result of co-negligence on two parties or three parties, whatever it maybe, in a situation where but for the negligence of both, there would have been no accident, it is immaterial, it is irrelevant, as to how much fault -- in what proportion the parties were at fault, because the accident would not have happened if both had not been at fault, and both had been at fault, it's fair and just that the damages should be borne equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.084" offset="11439731">Rather than an attempt to say, well, you hold only 10% negligence, so we are going to hold you liable for 10% of the consequences, but for the 10% it would not have been the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.355" offset="11492812">And then again, we have this practical problem, how do you assess fault on a mathematical basis when the conduct is not in the mathematical area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.714" offset="11546206">It's easier to see some party was negligent or not negligent, but it is not easy to say you were at fault to a certain extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.732" offset="11582255">And I rest on that, and more importantly I rest on the proposition that it is an immaterial consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.384" offset="11616946">But if, I contribute to somebody's damage, and I did that to substantial degree, that is, I am normally liable for the whole damage, but if the other fellow was also damage liable, it's perfectly fair for me to pay half of his damages, or have him to pay half of my damages where the accident would not have otherwise have happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.605" offset="11709837">I think I have covered substance of my argument, and will not detain this Court any longer.</text>
