            <text syncTime="9.129" offset="36467">A statute of the State of Wisconsin empowers a State Examining Board to license physicians and to investigate charges of professional misconduct and to revoke and suspend licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.519" offset="90070">When proceedings were instituted against appellee, he resorted to the federal court and brought this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.226" offset="120895">He claimed that the statute of the State of Wisconsin invalid because of among other things the board was empowered both to investigate and to adjudicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.000" offset="171990">And he claimed that this violated Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.127" offset="196441">The District Court entered a preliminary injunction on the grounds that the appellee faced irreparable injury and that he would very likely succeed with his suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.635" offset="246491">The state appealed and for the reasons we given in the opinion at some length, we unanimously reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.701" offset="278779">In our view, appellee is not likely to succeed on the constitutional grounds he alleged combining investigative and adjudicating functions is not per se unconstitutional and it is not unconstitutional in the circumstances of this case.</text>
