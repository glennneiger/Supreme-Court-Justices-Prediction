            <text syncTime="12.713" offset="154206">I must emphasize that the interviews in question here are not contests between the department employee and the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.499" offset="185344">The employee is a neutral party.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.665" offset="194017">He is just gathering the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.385" offset="204884">He has no interest, there's no money coming out of his own pocket here.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.988" offset="219303">There are no charges or any defenses that the claimant has to meet or make.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.498" offset="245321">All he has to do is tell it like it is or was the past two weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.840" offset="274683">The Steinberg situation shows that the seated interviews do not always result in a denial of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.784" offset="306552">Indeed, he was advised and instructed on how he could improve his efforts to meet his obligations to be eligible and he was then paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.873" offset="362872">The department system was certainly fair to him as it is to all claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.706" offset="386173">Claimants here would have us believe that simply by registering with the employment service and meeting the wage credit requirements that from then on they have a right to keep on collecting without saying or doing any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.169" offset="436015">This ignores the explicit requirements of the statutes that the claimants who receive benefits must each week be able to work and make reasonable attempts to secure employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="152.479" offset="713331">Such a right we submit to benefits is at best a conditional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.282" offset="728482">If I may analogize, this is comparable to a man being given a key to an apartment building.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.043" offset="755545">He can get into the building but unless he has keys to the individual apartments, he cannot get into these apartments.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.162" offset="784071">So, as a man registers for benefits, registers for work with the local office and meets the wage credit requirements, this is the key to the building.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.121" offset="831822">But he can't get into each apartment unless as each week, he meets the requirements of showing that he has made reasonable attempts to secure employment and that he has not restricted his availability.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.051" offset="883545">He is able to work.</text>

            <text syncTime="621.576" offset="2589654">Before I get into my argument, I would like to respond to a question that Justice Stewart raised yesterday concerning the rule of thumb on the reasonable work effort.</text>

            <text syncTime="680.489" offset="2825279">Mr. Hatcher testified that there was a rule of thumb that the claimant must list at least three places at which he has sought employment a week on his UC 45 form.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.033" offset="2871463">In response to a question from this Court, Mr. Hatcher said the claimants were advised to this rule that their benefits, rights interviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.018" offset="2899466">However, Eleanor Smarse, manager of the Bridgeport Unemployment Compensation Office responded to a question about where the claimants were told of the rule of thumb by stating it was not an official notification that they were to tell these people if that is what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.626" offset="2957876">But that is, there is no official number or anything in reference to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.586" offset="2973759">Thus, serious questions arise about whether a claimant can ever meet a burden of proof based on a rule of thumb that he has never heard of.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.487" offset="3005315">Indeed, even Mr. Hatcher conceded that in crash periods, not everyone receives a benefit rights interview at which the information is supposedly imparted.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.412" offset="3045021">The actual testimony for those that want to compare the context of that from Mrs. Smarse is at page 87 through 90 of the single appendix and on Mr. Hatcher pages 193 through 194 (a) of the single appendix.</text>

            <text syncTime="825.489" offset="3405302">Now, I'm not sure what that means that the people running the system may not know about it but the claimants apparently know about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.770" offset="3438425">There is just nothing in the record to support a finding that any claimant knew about this rule of thumb and in fact, to the contrary, I would refer the Court to the depositions of one of the original plaintiffs who Mr. Wasik did not mention during his argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1529.777" offset="6222451">She came back in two weeks later and she had her six signatures on the card.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.897" offset="6242931">She hadn't write down there and they said “well, you did it all in one day,” that isn't reasonable effort and she explained to them that her son who acted as her interpreter, had to go around with her on the one day that he could, off again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.579" offset="6309700">She was denied six consecutive weeks, finally got her hearing about three months later and the commissioner found, one of his finding is the fact is that she was desperate for work.</text>

            <text syncTime="1576.999" offset="6411368">No, the first two or four were unreasonable effort, the next four they denied simply because he had an appeal pending.</text>

            <text syncTime="2644.200" offset="10680195">Certainly as he -- there is policy that as the man receives benefits, the longer he receives benefits, perhaps the wider he should make a search for work and reduce his level of what he's seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.684" offset="10754069">In other words, we have case law that says he can look for a job as comparable as possible to his skills and income that he had before he was laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.801" offset="10790536">But the more he goes on unemployed, then he may have to lower the extensions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2686.661" offset="10849991">The question on third party information, counsel has overlooked the point that when third party information is used, the claimant is given the opportunity to reflect this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.702" offset="10898160">And if there is a contradictory statement, there is a statutory presumption in favor of the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.979" offset="10959287">And I would also add that the minimal aspect that importance that counsel will give on the governmental interest here is not just the money that's in the fund, although I would point out that this affects of course the employers who are taxed and indirectly it concerns the employees in the whole state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.733" offset="11042356">But it also concerns the administrative efficiency of the local officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.621" offset="11061896">They schedule a certain number of claimants that they can handle each day and so they must expeditiously handle these claims if we had to have a so-called due process hearing where every time a question arose as to a man's efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.992" offset="11123336">They could not handle the tremendous number of claimants who are coming in each week, there are some 40,000 claims a week during the period and issue that's in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.217" offset="11184253">I would simply respectfully submit that this Court was correct in affirming the Torres Dinger decision and I have the opportunity now to distinguish unemployment compensation cases and welfare cases by finding that Connecticut's procedures do satisfy Due Process requirements.</text>
