            <text syncTime="9.428" offset="37616">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.340" offset="61336">Petitioner, who was convicted in a state court of robbery, sought a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that he had been denied a fair trial because jurors had learned from news accounts of his prior felony convictions or certain facts about the robbery charge itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.445" offset="133747">In an opinion filed today, we hold that jurors' exposure to this type of information does not in a state trial presumptively deprive the defendant of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.482" offset="177842">Looking to the particular facts of this case, we hold that the jurors did not display hostility to petitioner, suggesting a partiality that could not be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.995" offset="223922">The jurors neither betrayed or belief in the relevance on petitioner's past through his present guilt nor withdrawn from a community with settlements so inflamed against petitioner as to call in to question various signs of impartiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.956" offset="291736">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denying the writ is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.289" offset="313156">The Chief Justice has filed an opinion concurring in the result and Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
