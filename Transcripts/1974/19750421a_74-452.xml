            <label>Mr. Simion H. Rifkind</label>
            <text syncTime="16.723" offset="170297">And may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.458" offset="181164">This case comes here on the petition for certiorari to review of decision of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.095" offset="215751">The petitioners have brought this suit to enforce their copyright claims against the respondent Aiken, who they alleged had infringed their rights by a public performance for profit of two songs, one the copyrighter which belonged to each of the petitioners respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.442" offset="305089">The district judge granted the statutory damages in favor of the plaintiff below of $250.00 for each infringement, the Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.605" offset="361827">Its asserted ground for reversal was that Aiken's conduct did not amount to a performance though it was public and it was for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.301" offset="416580">The facts are simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.109" offset="423790">Respondent Aiken owns and operates a chain of fast food restaurants in the City of Pittsburgh.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.955" offset="455241">He decided to entertain his costumers and to improve the efficiency of his employees by furnishing them with popular musical performances throughout the business day.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.136" offset="519920">There were, as I believe we can take judicial notice, available to him several methods by which his purposes could be accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.793" offset="574568">One, he could hire one or more musicians to play such compositions as he or his agent selected from the cheap music generally available to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.814" offset="638621">Secondly, he could if he chose equipt the premises with one or more machines that reproduce music mechanically when supplied with either records or tapes or piano roles, depending upon the nature of the particular machine that he decided to use, and these too are generally available for purchase by members of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.779" offset="738513">Or he could subscribe to a service like Muzak which provides musical compositions for use in premises by machinery equipped for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.370" offset="796818">And finally, he could if he wished, equipt his premises with a radio receiving set connected to an electric source of energy, install a sufficient number of loudspeakers so as to disseminate the sound agreeably throughout the premises that he wished to serve, and cause the radio receiving set to be oriented by his selection to any kind of music that he preferred from among the many that were being broadcast within the Pittsburgh area by the several stations doing business there.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.896" offset="966928">Aiken in fact chose the last mentioned method.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.496" offset="989393">I don't think I need to argue the point that it was the least costly method.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.269" offset="1016456">The district judge after trial found that on the 11th of March 1972, Aiken had caused the costumers and employees in one of his restaurants to be entertained by two compositions of which the petitioners were respectively the copyright owners</text>
            <text syncTime="248.260" offset="1096391">These compositions were received over Aiken's radio and were distributed through his restaurant and employment spaces through five loudspeakers which he had installed in the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.376" offset="1156890">These two compositions which he so played were broadcast that day by a FM station located in Pittsburgh and licensed to broadcast those compositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.413" offset="1217076">Aiken however had no license for the public performance for profit of these compositions and the radio station had no authority to confer such permission upon Aiken.</text>

            <text syncTime="302.852" offset="1314774">The possibility of an applied license had been expressly and explicitly withdrawn in the license issued by the copyright owners to this particular station as to all stations, and that had been true since 1932.</text>

          <turn speaker="simion_h_rifkind" startTime="349.341" stopTime="864.868">
            <label>Mr. Simion H. Rifkind</label>
            <text syncTime="349.341" offset="1500766">Oh no, he has other restaurants, but this particular infringement was of course brought as a test situation for the particular two songs that we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.695" offset="1546115">The District Court granted the plaintiff below the monetary damages requested which was $250.00 for each composition at the statutory rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.454" offset="1585194">As I've already stated, the Court of Appeals reversed that and I submit that I can state with confidence that the business purpose behind the selection of any one of the methods by which Aiken could have supplied musical entertainment to his guests and employees was identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.096" offset="1695744">It was to entertain guests and it was to improve the efficiency of his employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.997" offset="1715388">This much I believe is clear on the record, and all of these methods which ever one he selected would have to have recourse to music created by composers and made available to the public by means of either cheap music, records, tapes,piano roles or broadcast of electrical impulses.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.531" offset="1805458">And I suggest that until the Third Circuit had spoken, it was firmly established that no matter by which method Aiken entertained his guests and employees, he was bound to abstain unless he had a license from the copyright owner, such as ASCAP of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.019" offset="1927398">And of course such licenses were universally available under the compulsion of a decree which is enforced with respect to ASCAP.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.177" offset="1964074">I believe that it is still unquestioned that live performances in the restaurant by live musicians would be subject to the copyright laws and subject to Section 1 thereof, and that has been true certainly since Mr. Justice Holmes wrote Herbert against Shanley way back in 1917.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.549" offset="2077550">I believe it is still unquestioned that the record, tape, piano role method or electronic method of music is a public performance for profit, and indeed so the Third Circuit itself had held on a number of times.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.807" offset="2146617">And now the Third Circuit has decided that the last method, namely the radio plus loudspeaker method, although realistically and functionally indistinguishable from any of the other methods of furnishing the music, is for some reason beyond the reach of Section 1 of the Copyright Act although it is public, although it is for profit, but the Circuit Court said it is not a performance, and at arriving at that conclusion that it was not a performance, it said that it acted under the composure of this Court's mandate as expressed in the two CATV cases, the Fortnightly case and the Teleprompter case and it is that determination of the Court of Appeals that I most distinctly want to challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.482" offset="2385272">We challenge it and we challenge that decision on several grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.393" offset="2408991">We assert first that the old landmark decision rendered in 1931 entitled Buck against Jewell-LaSalle and reported in 283 U.S. by a majority court in an opinion written by Mr. Justice Brandeis, controls this case and that the judgment therefore should have gone for the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.037" offset="2515571">We also assert that Buck against Jewell-LaSalle can coexist in the same legal universe as Fortnightly and Teleprompter and that there is no incompatibility between them because Fortnightly and Teleprompter unlike this case, were concerned with a new technological development, never prior thereto with -- brought within the copyright system and never subjected to copyright royalty burdens and respect of which Congress had been quite silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.370" offset="2688815">And thirdly, that in any event, private arrangements have for over 40 years been made between the creators and consumers of mucic in reliance on Jewell-LaSalle and that Jewell-LaSalle therefore ought to be allowed to survive until Congress directs otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.135" offset="2807933">As far as the congressional voice is concerned, if I can read the incomplete compositions of that -- of those body, I can say that it seems to be targeted towards the continued viability of the doctrines of Jewell-LaSalle.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.651" offset="2901974">Now, to develop some of those points a little more explicitly, in a sense, this case is of course concerned with the construction of a section of the Copyright Law, Section 1 thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.287" offset="2964564">And that is of primary interest to the authors, composers and publishers of music whom the founding fathers expressed the desire to encourage in the Copyright and Patent Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.715" offset="3026213">But from the point of view of the development of our jurisprudence, I believe that more is involved than whether respondent Aiken has to pay $5.00 a month for the privilege of entertaining his business guests and improving the morale of his employees with music created by the copyright owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.259" offset="3104371">I suppose that the statute means exactly what this course declares it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.620" offset="3133837">And as I've stated a little while ago, ever since 1931, which is 44 years ago, the meaning of that statute was made plain in the case that I have cited Buck against Jewell-LaSalle.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.568" offset="3201651">It declared that Section 1 meant that one situated exactly like Aiken in this case and who did exactly what Aiken did in this case subjected himself to liability as an infringer of copyright, unless he was licensed to do what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.741" offset="3298304">The Court of Appeals in its analysis acknowledged that the case here under review is an all force with the facts of the case in Jewell-LaSalle.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.013" offset="3375417">Over 5000 contracts are now extent that we know of which have been entered into in reliance and in observance of Jewell-LaSalle, and in that case Mr. Justice Brandeis for a unanimous court said “There is no difference” -- we give you the exact language if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.964" offset="3491192">“There is no difference in substance between the case where a hotel engages an orchestra to furnish the music, and that where by means of the radio set and loudspeakers here employed, it furnishes the same music for the same purpose.”</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="864.868" stopTime="916.724">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="864.868" offset="3562872">Is not there one difference, Mr. Rifkind, in this sense possibly, to the question, do you think there's a difference since the radio station is selling advertising, presumably, and I would assume that as a matter of economics, the advertising rate is based upon the coverage of the radio station that it differs from the orchestra in the sense that the orchestra has no advertising, and the radio station is getting -- radio station having paid the royalty is getting a larger income because of the standard audience of restaurants, hotels, business establishments, etcetera.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="simion_h_rifkind" startTime="916.724" stopTime="1411.337">
            <label>Mr. Simion H. Rifkind</label>
            <text syncTime="916.724" offset="3770284">Let me explain that most explicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.896" offset="3782928">The rates established between the licensing organization, in this case ASCAP, which speaks for the owners of these compositions and the radio industry is determined under a system which is subject to judicial surveillance under the decree in United States against ASCAP, which has been administered in the Southern District of New York since 1940 and amended in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.196" offset="3892120">If my history, if my recollection of the dates is correct and I believe it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.534" offset="3913540">Those terms are negotiated in terms of what rights are conferred upon the broadcaster.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.290" offset="3940498">In this particular situation, broadcasters are expressly excluded from the right of conferring any authority upon people in Aiken's position, and consequently the rate that they pay takes into account the fact that ASCAP will collect another fee from the Aikens of this country, and therefore the fee paid by the broadcasters does not overlap the fee paid by the Aikens.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.806" offset="4062647">The District Court and the Court of Appeals both agreed that the circumstance that the radio station in Jewell-LaSalle was unlicensed and that here it was licensed was a difference without significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.006" offset="4135372">The -- I've explained why the suggestion that Mr. Justice Brandeis made in the footnote, as I believe Mr. Justice Rehnquist called attention that there might conceivably be -- the argument might be made that there's an implied license is no longer valid because in 1932 that was explicitly excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.424" offset="4225024">Logically, I should say, the suggestion of an implied license underscores the conclusion that the hotel or Aiken was performing and performing publicly for profit, because if it was not performing or not performing publicly for profit, there'd be no point in talking about a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.806" offset="4314572">It's only public performance for profit that requires a license, so Mr. Justice Brandeis' discussion of a possible implied license necessarily emphasizes his view that there was a performance and of course a performance for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.160" offset="4384057">Now, the Third Circuit seemed to be under the impression that Jewell-LaSalle had been overruled by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.148" offset="4423973">And I believe that therein, again I find myself in sharp disagreement with that Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.006" offset="4455424">I suppose it can not be challenged that this Court has never yet uttered the talismanic phrase which actually would decanonize Jewell-LaSalle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.403" offset="4504952">This Court had said in Fortnightly that Jewell-LaSalle should be understood as limited to its own facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.046" offset="4551555">The facts here are the very facts to which the Court said it should be limited to, and that is the very converse of treating it as overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.293" offset="4604531">Words of limitation to facts, a phrase not unusual in the opinions of this Court, I've always thought meant that the principle of the case may no longer be regarded as an axiom from which new theorems and new propositions might logically be deduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.418" offset="4701080">The Court of Appeals went much further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.751" offset="4710379">It has acted in reliance on the anticipation that this Court will overrule Jewell, and we entertain the hope that that prophecy is not a valid one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.707" offset="4766177">Be contend that the Court should not overrule Jewell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.727" offset="4782268">Indeed we assert that this case presents a conspicuous example of the salutary purposes of the rule of stare decisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.950" offset="4831169">For instance, I've already mentioned, very many people have shaped their business conduct in observance of and in reliance on that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.160" offset="4879966">Moreover, the rule offends no moral principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.245" offset="4900342">It does not offend good judgment as is evidenced by the fact that all over the world, Jewell-LaSalle is in fact lived by and if it should appear that this Court thinks that some different policy should now prevail, it seems to me that the proper agency to grapple with that is the Congress, and indeed the Congress is grappling with that problem at this very moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.371" offset="5024893">As Your Honors know, the Copyright Act has been under active consideration by the Congress for some time, and the delay in the new bill has been not Jewell-LaSalle, but the delay has been caused by the inability of the Congress to decide what to do about CATV.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.773" offset="5102425">Fortnightly, the first CATV case, was the first occasion on which the Jewell decision was ever questioned in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.748" offset="5150386">In that case, there were a number -- there was one dissent and three nonparticipants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.311" offset="5180583">In that case the Court confronted a brand new industry which had never been subjected to the copyright system, a new technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.047" offset="5227604">And then in 1974, the Court encountered another further development of that same technology in Fortnightly which brought signals beyond the realm of the original antennae.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.525" offset="5281520">But neither of the majority nor the minority in either of those cases suggested that Jewell should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.931" offset="5311091">The majority never even mentioned Jewell in the last Teleprompter case, and no justice to express the thought that hotel keepers and restaurateurs were free to entertain guests and stimulate employees by the free use of their music.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.833" offset="5386742">Aiken's behavior belongs to the unsophisticated realm of what we are fully familiar with, and it wouldn't be a bad idea therefore to see how the world regards that kind of behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.850" offset="5442748">I shall be brief and say that Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, France, Germany and every other country I could find any evidence of treats Aiken's performance as a breach of the copyright privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.986" offset="5515368">In the functional sense which is the idea introduced into this field by the decisions in Fortnightly and Teleprompter, comparison was made to the viewer erecting a giant antennae.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.188" offset="5588093">And I would like to suggest that another way to look at it would be as if it was a giant ear trumpet which made it possible for the listener to get signals which otherwise he couldn't hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.069" offset="5631666">And here's the point I want to make the distinction between those two kinds of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.757" offset="5650369">The purveyor of ear trumpets doesn't exploit music even though he sells them on the lobby of the opera house, but the furnisher of music to his costumers does exploit music no matter by what means as long as they're within his control that he brings it to bear upon business guests and his business employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1633.270" offset="6636440">The argument of my distinguished adversary has a captivating sound, but essentially I believe it begs the very question in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.427" offset="6685132">I think Mr. Justice Stewart has put his finger on the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.361" offset="6712822">The question is whether the Court of Appeals erred in deciding that when Mr. Aiken in his fast food shop where he has people in for not more than 15 minutes at the most, 60% of the costumers come in to pickup the delicatessen and take it out within two or three minutes, if they decide to consume it on the premises, then they can take it on disposable paper over to a counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.336" offset="6848763">No waitresses are supplied and they can stay there and eat it, and it's usually about 10 minutes, a maximum of 15 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.176" offset="6892126">I would agree with my learned brother that if Mr. Aiken hired the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra to perform in his fast food establishment, or a trio of musicians, or he put in complicated equipment whereby he could go out and buy tapes, select tapes and decide when they should be run without commercials, and perhaps with some advertisements for Aiken's that he might well be chargeable with infringing the copyrights of the music he performed, but that is not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.566" offset="7053667">We are concerned with the simple question whether on this particular day on this one store and the record deals only with one store, and I think it is a euphemism to call it a restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.032" offset="7115525">Whether on this day he engaged in a performance of ASCAP's two musical compositions when he turned his radio to an FM station in Pittsburgh and the radio broadcast came through the air to his store and were heard by his three employees and such costumers as happened incidentally to be on the premises.</text>

            <text syncTime="2120.274" offset="8584443">I do not believe that ASCAP can contrive language whereby they can say this, a broadcaster “We are going to license you to broadcast that is disseminate to the public our compositions, and we want you to pay us a royalty.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.714" offset="8654242">These are to go over the air to all members to the public and then say that Mr. Aiken or his costumers who are members to the public can not receive those broadcast without payment of the fee.</text>

            <text syncTime="2163.727" offset="8758314">Obviously, what Mr. Aiken has done in his store, which is a small room with two outfits on the ceiling of the public area or two speakers are located, and three other speakers, one on the washroom, the girl's washroom, one in the kitchen and one at the office for his employees is vastly different from the complicated mechanism of the large master radio receiving set in Jewell-LaSalle which piped Muzak to 200 rooms throughout the hotel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.730" offset="8882343">Or in the Statler Hotel case in New York where they had a radio engineer and two assistants on top of the building and they piped music through the ducts to 1900 rooms, and there they held it was a performance upon the authority of Jewell-LaSalle.</text>

            <text syncTime="2213.825" offset="8958621">However, I am not relying upon that because I think this Court has clearly stated in the Teleprompter case and on the Fortnightly case before, that viewers of television and by a parody of reasoning, listeners to radio broadcast do not perform, the broadcasters perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.688" offset="9050154">It's difficult to conceive functionally how Mr. Aiken can be said to be performing music in his establishment when he has no control over what is being broadcast, when it is being broadcast.</text>

            <text syncTime="2540.719" offset="10266206">I take it that all of your arguments would apply equally to the factual situation we have here, and a hypothetical restaurant let us say sits a thousand people as there are such with 20 different rooms, and in each room there was one outlet.</text>

            <text syncTime="2567.186" offset="10372159">If it used radio broadcast, I think it would logically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.124" offset="10395878">The difference comes of course a restaurant of that kind as the restaurant in the Herbert v. Shanley case to which my adversary eluded, may go in for a much different type of entertainment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.722" offset="10454288">To say that the business motivation of Mr. Aiken is like that of a hotel owner in Herbert v. Shanley, it seems to me to be fictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.951" offset="10503189">The Vanderbilt Hotel in New York was concerned with the ambiance of its hotel restaurant so it had an orchestra play, and it had undoubtedly liveried waiters, and it had fine napkins and tablecloths.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.450" offset="10585213">That is not true of an establishment of this kind which is willing to have just the radio come in and have two speakers in the public area where the sound can be audible evenly throughout the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.861" offset="10662849">The point is that my adversary is attempting to draw a line which I think is an arbitrary one -- artificial one between having a radio behind the counter encased in one cabinet that is it might have one speaker or two speakers, and that would not be a performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.314" offset="10756577">But he did have that in this particular shop, but he found it to be blared if you were close to it if you heard it too loudly, if you were a little further away you might not hear it as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.571" offset="10801612">And that blare did interfere with conversations with costumers, so instead he had speakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.600" offset="10829824">I was not unusual, these days I'm told, in fact it's quite common when you buy a radio to have speakers outside of the tuning device and you might put them ten feet away, you may have them the other part of the room, you may put it in another room.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.588" offset="10897742">But so far as Mr. Aiken's “performance” is concerned, he did nothing more than install this equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.328" offset="10936717">He did not manipulate it once it was installed and is no different than if he had just one unit with the speakers incased in a cabinet so far as his function relative to the broadcast were concerned -- was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.319" offset="11012681">I think the reasoning of this Court in the Fortnightly and Teleprompter cases is dispositive of ASCAP's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.585" offset="11049671">I think the Court of Appeals correctly perceive it to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.797" offset="11066598">It's certainly illogical, I would think to be clear that the function of a cable system has little in common with the function of a broadcaster, because like viewers and unlike broadcasters, they do not perform the programs they receive and carry, and then turn around and hold Mr. Aiken to be engaged in a performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.618" offset="11169834">Mr. Aiken is obviously on the listening side of the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.031" offset="11195538">As a matter of fact in the Fortnightly case and Teleprompter, many CATV systems serve commercial establishments as well as subscribers in there homes, to say on the one hand that the CATV system is on the listening side or the viewing side of the line, but Mr. Aiken who is a subscriber jumps over to the performing side of the line, seems to me to be arbitrary.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold David Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="2822.629" offset="11393860">I think the new statute attempts and the legislative history indicates that establishments such as Aiken's, small establishment or barbershops or so forth, would not be subject to liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.700" offset="11454151">And also, I may point out that the statute provides that there maybe transmissions even by a hotel to guest rooms without incurring any copyright liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.849" offset="11518725">As a matter of fact the legislative history will disclose that even ASCAP, Judge Rifkind's client did not attempt to enforce Jewell-LaSalle against hotels which piped music to guest rooms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.171" offset="11576090">After the Statler case in New York was a victory for SCSACZAK which is a counterpart of ASCAP, there apparently was some question whether this was a performance for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.593" offset="11657697">At any rate, the legislative history discloses that there was very little attempt to enforce the rights of the performing rights organization against hotels which transmitted programs to private rooms in hotel even though Jewell-LaSalle presumably gave them that right under the Jewell-LaSalle construction of the 1909 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.937" offset="11763127">So, the answer to the question Mr. Justice Brennan is that I would be foolhardy if I attempted to prognosticate the effect of pending legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.049" offset="11815581">As you know, there has been -- they have been studying the revision of the copyright law since 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.795" offset="11846510">There was an authorization from Congress to the copyright office, extensive studies were made, there was, I refer to a report in 1961 as being the culmination of studies, but my opponent's reply brief says it was not the culmination but of course the foreword, though the report said, it is the culmination of studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.635" offset="11937938">At any rate, there were a lot of comments and discussions and compromises and they came out with a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.232" offset="11976286">It passed one House, as Judge Rifkind pointed out, did not pass the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.018" offset="11995408">I do not know what may eventually come out of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.970" offset="12019231">But certainly, we are concerned here with the construction of an existing statute, and if this Court in 1931 decided a case on a premise or a doctrine which has been found not to be sound, not to be logical, it should be the responsibility of this Court to correct that decision not to wait for Congress to correct it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.602" offset="12157785">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3025.240" offset="12204283">I gathered as I listened to my learned friend that there might be a distinction drawn between Jewell-LaSalle in this case and that the station in Jewell-LaSalle, the broadcast station was unlicensed and here it is licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.755" offset="12282441">I think the argument advanced by one of the dissenting justices in Fortnightly, Mr. Justice Fortas.</text>

            <text syncTime="3053.735" offset="12318281">The only, excuse me, of course you are right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.431" offset="12337089">I was thinking for a moment of Teleprompter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.489" offset="12345344">In Fortnightly, he pointed out that the interpretation of the term performed cannot logically turn on the question on whether the material that is used is licensed or not licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.919" offset="12395081">And I don't think there's any way of meeting that logical proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.845" offset="12414725">More importantly, we have the distinction of a non-licensed station was a judicially first noticed and abandoned back in 1937 when Judge Woolsey in the southern district decided the Hotel Statler case, and since then and before then never once in all the literature of this subject, in all the discussions of the copyright office, in all the legislative discussion has there been so much of a trace of a distinction attributable to this coincidental fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.272" offset="12568430">I can see how logically it can play the role.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.438" offset="12585148">I heard the argument advanced that perhaps Aiken's performance was not for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.504" offset="12613360">You heard a suggestion that the costumers only spent a little bit of time there and so on and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.648" offset="12645961">Well, on the merits of course that issue has been resolved by Herbert against Shanley where Mr. Justice Holmes made a cogent remark “It is true that music is not the sole object and neither is the food” he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.214" offset="12732270">If music didn't pay, it would be given up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.517" offset="12745435">Mr. Aiken spent money to furnish music to his costumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.710" offset="12762258">He must have regarded it as money well spent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.225" offset="12780231">I say, the issue below was treated as established.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.912" offset="12795068">Indeed it was not challenged seriously as the Court of Appeals pointed out, so that the issue is not really in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.897" offset="12830908">The petition for cert didn't mention it or neither did the answer to the petition for cert.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.239" offset="12860374">To suggest now at this late stage of this case that this Court should consider whether only music which is offered for sale by a ticket at the door is within the copyright statutes, I think that that's to extend the implications of this case far beyond what we are now confronting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.221" offset="12952221">There was a question as to how many licenses of this kind were outstanding and the figure was given correctly, over 5000, But what was not stated that there are 75,000 establishments which used music, so I do not know and have no evidence of any information that there are lots of Aikens around this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.150" offset="13063920">But even if there were, that wouldn't change the fact if the copyright owners have a right against Aiken, they have a right to enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.653" offset="13122017">The suggestion was made that even though the implication of an -- the suggestion of an implied license is no longer tenable, in fact because the license to the radio station expressly excluded it that there was some kind of a doctrine by which ASCAP was prohibited from entering to that kind of an arrangement with the broadcast station.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.436" offset="13225148">Well, all I can say is that that's a startling notion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.810" offset="13238627">Every time a piece of cheap music is installed at the corner store, it is -- gives confers authority upon the buyer to play it on his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.927" offset="13275094">That doesn't mean that he may give a performance for profit on that cheap music and escape royalty obligations.</text>
