            <text syncTime="60.566" offset="325314">We are here pursuant to this courts’ order of last June which we stored this case to the calendar for re-argument, directing the parties to address the question of whether this court's holding in Banco Nacional de Cuba versus Sabbatino should be reconsidered.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.585" offset="381425">The United States filed a brief amicus and we have seated 15 minutes of our time for oral argument to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.187" offset="407757">On this question, our position, supported by the United States is that Sabbatino should be reconsidered insofar as it maybe read to permit a foreign sovereign to utilize the Act of State doctrine to repudiate its commercial obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.667" offset="469719">The amount of foreign trade being conducted by government agencies continues to increase in size and importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.593" offset="497409">Largely, as a result of that, the Doctrine of Sovereign Immunity in the United States and elsewhere has been restricted so that a government, acting in a commercial capacity may not assert sovereign immunity as a defense to defeat adjudication of claims properly brought against it.</text>

            <text syncTime="159.396" offset="720599">And in that case, even though they are defendant and they are not seeking relief, your position is that the claim of the private plaintiff can be adjudicated.</text>

            <label>Mr. Victor S. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="167.586" offset="753409">Absolutely your honor, certainly under the restrictive theory of Sovereign Immunity, there have been some difficulties where the State Department for example may come in and suggest immunity even though the case would seem to be covered by the restrictive theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.640" offset="817566">But absent such as suggestion, the rule today is fairly unanimous in the United States’ courts that such a claim can be adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.779" offset="854137">We do not see any reason why a foreign government should be able to accomplish the same result that it could have accomplished under Sovereign Immunity, simply by characterizing a repudiation of its obligations as an active state.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.686" offset="909830">Before addressing this question more fully, however we feel that compelled distress here as we have in our briefs that this issue need be reached by the court only if certain threshold issues are passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.925" offset="958731">In particular we do not believe this issue need be reached unless this court agrees with the Court of Appeals that the Act of State in issue here was indeed Cuba’s repudiation of its obligation to return to Dunhill, certain payments that Dunhill had made to Cuba for cigars.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.218" offset="1019963">I stress this because Cuba now appears to argue with us contrary to its prior position and although for different reasons that this holding of the Court of Appeals was incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.125" offset="1059564">In order to put these contentions in context and explain some of these threshold questions, I would like to very briefly the history of litigation in a capsule form.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.583" offset="1101360">Litigation arouse out of the 1960 decree in Cuba, which nationalized or intervened certain Cuban cigar factories.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.793" offset="1134274">Dunhill and two other United States importers for number of years simply stood on the side lines as stake holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.354" offset="1156426">While the former owners of these businesses in Cuba battled in the courts of the United States to determine which of them was entitled to payments for cigar shipped both before and after the intervention?</text>
            <text syncTime="280.200" offset="1203865">In the prior action, not involving Dunhill and the other importers, Palicio v. Brush &amp; Bloch, it was held by the second circuit that the interveners could recover from all of the post intervention shipments of the cigars.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.515" offset="1249109">The interveners at that point stipulated that the owners could recover from the pre-interventions shipments because in their view the amounts were too small to worry about.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.996" offset="1287038">After those threshold issues were resolved, both the owners and the interveners pressed their claims against the importers.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.294" offset="1312220">That is this action, later then developed in this action that the fundamental assumption which underlay that stipulation was incorrect because it turned out as of the date of the intervention, there was unpaid, almost a half a million dollars for pre-intervention shipments of cigars.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.635" offset="1377631">It further developed in our case and it was strenuously contested by the interveners that the importers had paid those sum shortly after the interveners and it further developed that those payments had found their way to the Cuban government.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.329" offset="1432384">As a matter of law, the District Court ruled that those amounts were still owed by the importers to the owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.636" offset="1457566">We had paid the wrong people but we could recover those amounts from Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.055" offset="1479300">In the case of Dunhill, because the amounts transmitted to Cuba exceeded by some $55,000, the amount due for cigar shipment after the intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.480" offset="1512945">The district court entered in affirmative judgment in favor of Dunhill against Cuba in that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.397" offset="1536665">The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Courts rulings in every respect, except one.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.557" offset="1553278">It set aside the affirmative judgment against Cuba in favor of Dunhill.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.428" offset="1572818">The Court of Appeals held again over Cuba’s vigorous opposition that the evidence showed, that Cuba had received all of the post intervention payments, but it also held that Cuba’s, “Failure to honor the importers demand” for return of the payments constituted and act of state, therefore under Sabbatino and First National City Bank, no affirmative judgment could be entered against Cuba.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.980" offset="1759019">On that issue, the issue on the accounts receivable, the court held since the accounts receivable had the United States situs that no Act of State would be recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.950" offset="1814816">The net effect, of course of the Court of Appeals ruling is to impose double liability against Dunhill for the amounts which now can not be recovered against Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.093" offset="1851388">Under the rulings of the court now, that money is still owed by Dunhill to the owners and there is no recovery over.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.902" offset="1882630">The first threshold question, before we reach Sabbatino, of course remains the principal question on which certiori was originally granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.044" offset="1915231">That is, whether statements by counsel for Cuba, that petitioners, Justin Richmond counter claim would not be honored by his client constitute or evidence an act of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.358" offset="1960475">We continue to urge as we did before, that in our view, that those statements that Cuba would refuse to make any such repayments did not and could constitute an act of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.066" offset="2007287">We will not delay with that argument here again.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.696" offset="2017840">We note only that if only our position is accepted in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.624" offset="2033514">Reexamination of Sabbatino, however desirable in unnecessary to decision of the case, the result would simply be the revert to Judge Brian’s ruling and reinstate the affirmative judgment he entered against Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.286" offset="2088162">The second major threshold issue is created by Cuba’s complete shift in position, as to precisely what constitutes the operative act of state against Dunhill in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.297" offset="2128286">Court of Appeals of course stood for the repudiation of the obligation to pay Dunhill.</text>

            <text syncTime="624.526" offset="2581145">It is quite clear that up to the time that certiori was granted in this case, the only act of state on which Cuba was relying was this repudiation of the asserted obligation.</text>

            <text syncTime="677.150" offset="2791691">It is of course absurd to characterize this as an ordinary commercial controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.074" offset="2807365">It arouse not out of normal international trade but out of an intervention and it is the intervention, which is the act of state, not the repudiation of a commercial debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.532" offset="2849161">We are faced with another threshold difficulty here in analyzing just what it is that Cuba says it is the act of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.812" offset="2874343">There was of course no proof of anything at the trial, other than the fact that a decree has been entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.094" offset="2903391">With respect to the decree itself, there are some very difficult issues presented by Cuba’s present position.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.910" offset="2950725">That is the decree, now somehow constitutes the act of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.620" offset="2973504">The theory of that of course is that the decree, having nationalized the accounts receivable of the owners somehow operated to give the claim of right to Cuba’s appropriation of the funds as they arrived in Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.596" offset="3029406">The difficulty is that to deal with that issue, I do not believe that proper parties are before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.629" offset="3061589">In that effect of dealing with reversing the lower court's conclusions on that issue would be to adversely affect the rights of the owners.</text>

            <text syncTime="1409.525" offset="5721167">Indeed, in many instances with the numerous forms that now exists in the commercial world, it is difficult to know and indeed one may never know precisely what the form of the other entity is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.937" offset="5778846">There are types of trading companies throughout the world that have no analogue in our system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1435.025" offset="5823149">The interest to be served may never be fully be known by the other party of the transaction but in entering into agreements with those entities as well as with the state trading companies or with private traders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.568" offset="5881350">The expectations of the parties do not vary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.118" offset="5891486">The considerations do not vary, there is as much difference in dealing from one government to another government, as there is between a large company and a small company, as between one country and another country, differences vary by all of these considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.831" offset="5966405">I am saying that there is no reason for making any distinction in my view between the obligations and the rights of parties dealing with foreign sovereigns in the commercial context as opposed to when they deal with private traders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.757" offset="6038085">I can not argue with Cuba, when Cuba says the government agencies will not likely repudiate their commercial transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.627" offset="6065566">I take that to be a given, particularly countries which engage in state trading on a large scale, have a vital interest in protecting their reputation in the international community but the same is true of the private trader in the international community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.141" offset="6123662">Indeed, in international trade, perhaps more so even in domestic trade because of the smaller opportunity for face to face contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.126" offset="6159607">Trading reputations are particularly important but I suggest that those do not vary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.192" offset="6179773">The importances of that do not vary depending on whether one is dealing with a state trading agency or with a significant private trading agency.</text>

            <label>Mr. Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="1554.149" offset="6299623">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court?</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.659" offset="6313729">The principal purpose of the governments appearing as amicus in the present case is to preserve the vitality of a legal doctrine which is not itself technically at issue in the case but which the opinion of the court below, if accepted by this court would effectively destroy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.511" offset="6405053">I refer of course to the restrictive Doctrine of Sovereign Immunity, under which, it is not all of the activities of a foreign sovereign as to which that sovereign will not be held accountable in our courts but rather only those activities which are of governmental as opposed to a private nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.962" offset="6490944">At the time, the famous Tate letter was issued by the State Department in 1952, that Modern Doctrine of Sovereign Immunity had already been adopted by virtually all of the important trading nations of the West.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.326" offset="6552384">The significant exceptions were England and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.142" offset="6567639">Since that time, only last November in the Philippine Admiral Case, the privy council has made England is no longer an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.553" offset="6605256">It has likewise been assumed that the United States is no longer an exception to the restrictive theory of Sovereign Immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.989" offset="6647051">Although the matter has never reached this court, it has been considered a number of times by lower Federal Courts and by State Courts, and their decisions are uniform in accepting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.544" offset="6693236">In view of those decisions, in view of the Tate letter and in view of the deference which this court has normally accorded to the State Department's views in this area of Sovereign Immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.969" offset="6746944">It has properly been assumed that the applicable United States Law does adopt the restrictive theory of Sovereign Immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.143" offset="6791665">Respondents have not asserted sovereign immunity in the present case for the obvious reason that the assertion would not have been permitted under the restrictive theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.612" offset="6833461">There are several other reasons why the assertion may not have laid as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.862" offset="6850493">But clearly there was no way, in which the merchandising of tobacco or the receipt of an erroneous payment in connection with that merchandising activity could have been considered as governmental activity rather that a commercial activity on the part of the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.565" offset="6925308">That being so, it would surely reduce the law to ineffectiveness and perhaps expose it to ridicule, if the respondent having being denied, the claim of sovereign immunity, were able to achieve precisely the same result by simply appearing and repudiating the obligation as to the very acts on which the claim of Sovereign Immunity was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.092" offset="7043381">Nothing occurred in this case except the appearance of an attorney who instead of asserting any sovereign immunity, simply asserted that the government of Cuba would not honor the obligation and what is claimed is that the effect of that statement should be the same as far as the rights of these parties are concerned as the assertion of the sovereign immunity under the Old Absolute Theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.023" offset="7163127">Respondents reply brief, seeks to calm our fears on this point by assuring us that repudiation of a commercial obligation will be unlikely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.400" offset="7212655">Respondents says, I am quoting his reply brief to the government now “it is only in the unusual case and we suggest primarily in the political case in which this defense is called upon”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.892" offset="7262601">That is the Act of State Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.937" offset="7278797">He continues “it is likely that the more naked the repudiation, that is the more unconnected with governmental functions, the more political the background”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.576" offset="7325399">The trouble with all of these hopeful assurances is that they are destroyed by the experience of this very case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.561" offset="7353298">There could not have been a more naked repudiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.527" offset="7365210">The mere statement of council in the case and as to the high political background of the repudiation, its non-existence is shown by the fact that up until the point when it was discovered that we were talking about a lot of money, Cuba was willing to stipulate on the point and indeed did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.467" offset="7464893">That was one of the issues below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.598" offset="7477432">There is no high political background here, it is simply a question of a lot of money and until it was clear that it involved with a lot of money, Cuba did not care about the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.000" offset="7515048">I suggest then that despite what the respondents assert in the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.243" offset="7536051">If the Theory of Act of State, that respondent is arguing in this case is adopted, we can expect the state trading nations to use it precisely where they previously used the Doctrine of Absolute Sovereign Immunity, that is wherever they do not wish to be held liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.638" offset="7625598">How then can one avoid this absurd result?</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.820" offset="7646287">On one hand saying, the foreign state has no sovereign immunity but on the other saying, which means the sovereign must simply appear and say that it does not want to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.417" offset="7692681">In the view of the United States, it is difficult not to avoid that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.076" offset="7715355">If one simply regards the statement and the application of the act of state doctrine as it has historically been described and applied by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.007" offset="7767078">Respondents would have us believe that the act of state doctrine applies to all acts of a sovereign power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.573" offset="7793305">But whether one chooses the old cases or the new ones, whether one takes the formulation in Underhill or in Sabbatino, the description of the doctrine has always shown that this is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.185" offset="7843773">There have been qualifications not simply a statement that an act of state is not examinable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.947" offset="7866865">In Underhill, for example, the Doctrine of the Act of State was described as applicable to acts done by sovereigns within their own states in the exercise of governmental authority, two qualifications, in their own states and in the exercise of governmental authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.977" offset="7942934">In Sabbatino, it was described as being applicable to public acts of a recognized foreign sovereign power committed within its own territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.964" offset="7986924">In other words, two conditions are attached, the first is the Territorial Condition that the act of state must have been performed within the governments own territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.353" offset="8024436">One may interpret that territorial condition, literally I suppose and if it is interpreted literally, the only act of state that appears on the record on the present case occurred within the United States consisting of the statement of the Council for Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.724" offset="8081905">There is no evidence of any other action on the part of the Government of Cuba.</text>

          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="2137.670" offset="8633716">Yes Sir, Well, I think as described in the Governments brief, we think that the issue of Sabbatino is not involved in this case because the Act of State Doctrine properly understood, is not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.837" offset="8706441">There was no act of state; therefore there is no reason for Sabbatino to be presented to the court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.631" offset="8733608">If however, the court should disagree with our interpretation of the Act of State Doctrine, and if the court should find when Sabbatino spoke of an act of state, it meant an act of state which could even consist of a simple repudiation of a contractual obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.275" offset="8796198">Then I would assert that Sabbatino should be reexamined but there on that point on whether a commercial can be an act of state but in the view of the government, there is really no need to get to that issue because it would be reading Sabbatino to be unnecessarily wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.801" offset="8878222">If one were to read its description of act of state to include this simple repudiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.419" offset="8916779">As I was saying, the court's decision and the application of the acts of state doctrine have brought forward two conditions, the territorial conditions, which can be interpreted literally or as government suggests in its brief, perhaps can better be interpreted not literally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.785" offset="8982189">So as to mean the act of state must be committed within the territory of the state and if it is committed within that territory, that is enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.092" offset="9019388">If it is not, that is absolutely conclusive that there is no act of state, rather we think that the expression of territoriality is really a description of the most common situation in which the foreign governmental act constitutes an act as to which there is such a preeminent claim of the foreign government to exclusive Legislative Jurisdiction over the matter that the courts of the United States should not interpose our reexamination of that foreign states action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.425" offset="9184795">It is the second qualification to the Act of State Doctrine which is squarely raised in the present case which is of most importance to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.050" offset="9219277">That the qualification that the act of state, is an act performed in the exercise of governmental authority and that it is a public act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.337" offset="9268387">Respondents would have us believe that these qualifications mean nothing that they are mere surplusages and entirely redundant that when one says the act of state, one has said it all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.185" offset="9315825">So long as the state has acted, that is it but the case has not described it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.317" offset="9332335">They have felt constrained to say, an act of the State in the exercise of its governmental authority or to say public acts of a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.465" offset="9372877">I would assert to the contrary of respondent's contention that it is not the governments position on this matter that is new or novel, what is truly novel and inventive is the repudiation which occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.999" offset="9431078">If the act of state doctrine, indeed were understood to be as respondent represents it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.043" offset="9455215">It is indeed, marvelous that such a repudiation before an American court has never to our knowledge previously occurred, that is the novelty in the case, not the government's assertion of what I believe that have been understood to be the correct interpretation of the act of state doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.173" offset="9539747">We assert, in other words, that the decision of the second circuit in the victory transport case, which involved precisely this issue, whether the denomination by State of a port in a commercial contract as a safe port amounted to an act of state and therefore could not be reexamined in litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.353" offset="9636505">The second circuit held of course that the denomination of the safe port in a contract is a commercial act which merchants do all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.618" offset="9673494">The mere fact that it was done by a state or by a state trading agency makes no difference and does not prevent the courts from inquiring into the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2504.675" offset="10101798">The second purpose, the purpose of enabling the court to avoid cases which do not have manageable legal standards, that purpose also was not served by adopting an act of state doctrine in the commercial field which is almost the prototype of a field of where there are manageable legal standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="2619.238" offset="10559985">I am glad that I can not find one point of agreement with the government in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.637" offset="10589556">In the assertion that the Sabbatino case is not involved in this litigation, I agree completely with that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.762" offset="10634069">I think that my analysis is different, but I think I can agree that the issue of the Sabbatino case, need not to be in fact as I understand the situation can not be reached on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.719" offset="10693941">Let me first address myself to what has been the principal burden of the petitioners’ argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.282" offset="10720168">Namely, was there an act of state by the government of Cuba and what was it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.198" offset="10743887">Yes, there was an act of state and the act of state was the Intervention Decree of September 16th 1960 and everything that has happened since that time has been based on that intervention decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.905" offset="10806686">Of course it was not a single act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.570" offset="10817344">No political act and perhaps no human act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.733" offset="10829987">It is a single act that had consequences and the ultimate consequences are that it resulted in a refusal to honor, an obligation which the District Court, 10 years later found that it had to Dunhill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.219" offset="10915982">A great deal has been said in this case, on the prior argument and in the opinion of briefs of counsel and in the opinion of the District Court, about statements of counsel that the act of state here consisted only of statements of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.416" offset="10996753">Since, I was the counsel, I have felt a heavy burden here to justify my attempting to act as sovereign and passing acts of state and so I looked at the record to see what it was that counsel had said at the District Court level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.879" offset="11086614">I find in closing argument, words which I have reproduced in a footnote to the brief filed in response in reply to the brief of the United States as a amicus curiae.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.267" offset="11140113">Appears at the bottom of page five of that brief, it is the last of the many briefs that have been filed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.404" offset="11176684">I am reading in the middle, I do not want to take too much time on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.998" offset="11190999">Under the Act of State Doctrine, the Cuban government in accepting, expropriating, seizing, and nationalizing, whatever words you want, to take this money has done so pursuant to a regulation, a law, a decree of the Government of Cuba and therefore the Courts of this State will not look in to the matter nor will the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.605" offset="11285458">I am not talking about the extra territorial effect of an act of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.407" offset="11304684">I am talking about a territorial effect, namely the seizure or the acceptance, or the appropriation of this money when it got down to Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.506" offset="11341047">We are not concerned if they expropriated debts on September 15th, the question is what happened on October 1st and 15th, November 8th and December 12th when the money came down?</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.572" offset="11397367">At that time the Cuban Government took this money and under the Act of State Doctrine, it belongs to the Cuban Government and the decree to which the counsel was referring in that case, was of course the Nationalization Decree of September 15, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.741" offset="11474062">Not to any other Act of State, which counsel made up or created or passed in the course of his argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. Victor Rabinowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="3889.328" offset="15640384">No sir, I would say it was an effort on the part of the Judiciary to maintain its independence by not putting itself in political position which would make it very difficult for it to do so and if your honor would take a reference on that, I think that my last brief in response to the Governments brief, I cited in a rather extensive footnote the comments by former Attorney General Katzenbach in discussing the Rosemarie case in which he pointed to a notorious example in which the Judiciary of Great Britain was forced into a position where it had to make a finding in one way or the other on an issue because the government had so committed itself to that position that to have otherwise would have resulted in a very serious conflict between the Judiciary and the Government and this is precisely what I think the act of state doctrine is designed among other things to accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.972" offset="15898891">But when we get to the question between political versus commercial obligations, and the Government's I say contentions that we know have a restrictive theory of act of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.544" offset="15949256">The Government's contention here is based on first, the government says that this is primarily by analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3981.776" offset="16010173">It is by analogy to the restrictive sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.929" offset="16022816">We have a restrictive theory of sovereign immunity, a theory which incidentally has never been passed upon this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.017" offset="16047163">And therefore, we should have a restrictive theory of act of state as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.657" offset="16061687">The restrictive theory is as formulated by the Tate letter in the State Department was that sovereign immunity should not apply to urie gestiones or commercial transactions, business transactions I guess would be a better translation but should apply to urie imperia.</text>
            <text syncTime="4018.990" offset="16158967">Now that distinction which was established by the Tate letter, has not had a history that should commend itself to its extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.562" offset="16205256">Every commentator or almost commentator discussing that question has found that very difficult to make this distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.943" offset="16238797">The usual example given is the contract by which a government buys shoes for its army.</text>
            <text syncTime="4046.498" offset="16269099">The Government in its brief in this case, says that is obviously a commercial transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.408" offset="16296684">The Court of Appeals in the victory transport case said it finds such a contention astonishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4060.501" offset="16325105">It is obviously a governmental action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.316" offset="16336286">The fact of the matter is that dichotomy between commercial and political or commercial and business and government is in the era in which we leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.391" offset="16384665">A false one because there are many acts which are both commercial and highly political.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.698" offset="16413817">We need only read the newspapers to see that large numbers of our commercial transactions whether it be oil from the Middle East or it be wheat to Russia or it be copper from the operated Copper Mines in Chile, all of these which on the surface appear to be commercial transactions which in effect have tremendous political implications and therefore what I suggest a slick and easy distinction between the two is one that should be accepted with a great deal of caution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.310" offset="16568253">Now, let us take this case, counsel various times in brief here have referred to this as a commercial transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4131.915" offset="16610676">As I did my best to point out this morning, this was not a commercial transaction at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4138.082" offset="16635336">It was a transaction not involving a debt between Tobacco merchants as someone put it in one of the briefs, but a transaction which arouse out of, it was one of a long series of political decrees in the Republic of Cuba in the course of the transformation in the course of the transformation of the economic, social and political systems of that government which took place beginning in 1960 and I suppose extending right on into the present</text>
            <text syncTime="4167.084" offset="16751424">This intervention decree was one of many intervention decrees, which nationalized private property in Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="4176.011" offset="16787055">In no sense was it a commercial transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4179.430" offset="16800743">Since that time Cuba has engaged in extensive commercial transactions between Tobacco merchants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.518" offset="16829164">As a matter of fact, one of the best of the customers of Cuba throughout the world is Dunhill, which purchases Cigars in large numbers and sells them throughout Canada and England and perhaps in other parts of the world without any problems about commercial repudiation of debts or anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4205.896" offset="16906591">Those are ordinary commercial transactions; no questions are raised about sovereign immunity, about the act of state when there is a dispute about whether the cigars are wormy or not wormy, or whatever else happens to cigars.</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.892" offset="16954656">The disputes are settled in the normal course.</text>
            <text syncTime="4219.749" offset="16962075">Nobody pleads sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4221.210" offset="16967927">Nobody pleads the act of state, the business goes on in perfectly normal way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4225.592" offset="16985376">This is not that kind of transaction at all, this transaction was a transaction which was originally a transaction which expropriated, and which Cuba expropriated the property not on Dunhill, expropriated the property of its own citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4243.499" offset="17057056">It was a political act and in no way a commercial act and that has been the guts and the source, and the origin of the problem that existed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4254.755" offset="17102091">The formulation that Mr. Justice Stevens referred to a while ago, I believe that it was a brief in petition to opposition, the petition for certiori, must be read, I submit against the background of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4274.751" offset="17182026">It was not a new repudiation of a commercial debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4278.515" offset="17197073">It was an old position that had been taken from the very beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4283.205" offset="17215881">I think that the origin of the formulation which I agree now was an unfortunate one is due to the fact that at time we were talking about a Court of Appeals’ decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4292.628" offset="17253602">We were trying to dissuade this court from issuing certiori to review a Court of Appeal's decision and we used the language which perhaps the Court of Appeals used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4301.934" offset="17290800">But certainly, it was never regarded by anyone as a commercial as distinguished from a political transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.369" offset="17332491">Now, the fact is, that the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity which the government places a great deal of reliance on has not been applied at all by the State Department in delicate and difficult and troublesome situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.394" offset="17392678">I refer to in my brief to three notorious cases in which this is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="4333.307" offset="17416292">In Rich v. Naviera Vacuba, in Spacil against Crowe and I believe in as Branson against the President of India, there were three transactions which was perfectly normal everyday commercial transactions, involving the sale of copper, the sale of wheat and an attachment by a long shoreman who wanted wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="4356.141" offset="17507616">In every one of those cases, the State Department filed a suggestion of immunity in direct contradiction to the Tate letter and when it was asked to explain it said, we do not have to explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.727" offset="17561951">As a matter of executive discretion, we do not have to explain anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="4374.074" offset="17579401">We can apply the Tate letter or not apply the Tate letter as we wish.</text>
            <text syncTime="4378.605" offset="17597478">Now I respectfully suggest that this is not a rule of law that should be automatically, without much more thought be extended to the act of state doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.974" offset="17646901">There is a great deal of difference between Sovereign Immunity and Act of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4396.208" offset="17667904">Sovereign Immunity never goes to the merits of the situation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.214" offset="17687861">Sovereign Immunity merely relates to a question of jurisdiction and it has in historical terms, a base involving a committee between nations of the fact that a country might be insulted if it was sued in the courts of the United States that this is an upfront to a foreign sovereign to sue it in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4420.355" offset="17764452">We have a Doctrine of Sovereign Immunity in our own law affecting the right of a citizen to sue the United States modified by statute but still a doctrine which in the absence a statute exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="4430.999" offset="17807084">There is nothing strange or revolutionary or restrictive about the ancient doctrine of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4441.167" offset="17847731">The Act of State Doctrine is quite a different matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4443.900" offset="17858702">Now we are concerned, and for the first time, unlike in the sovereign immunity case, we are concerned with passing on the question of the validity, well known of the act of a foreign sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="4459.230" offset="17919933">This is a question that never arises in connection with sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4463.655" offset="17937696">I think it will always arise in connection with the act of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4467.225" offset="17951907">It is only that in the act of state area that we get to the question of the merits of the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4473.023" offset="17975104">In the Sovereign Immunity situation, we stop at the very beginning and say either we have jurisdiction or we do not have a jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4479.927" offset="18002794">When we get to the act of state, the problem is a much more serious one and as I say, it seems to be that the extension of a sovereign immunity doctrine which have not been noticeable for its success, should not be made so quickly to the act of state area and particularly is that true because so far this case is concerned, as I have pointed out, I do not believe that we have in any sense of the word, a commercial transaction, it is a political transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4514.437" offset="18140825">I suppose it had commercial aspect just like many political acts have commercial aspect but primarily and in its essence, the issue that was raised here is a political issue and not a commercial issue and the extension of the Doctrine of Sovereign Immunity will raise all sorts of problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="4538.441" offset="18236851">I do not know how the courts have handled Rich against Naviera Vacuba, had it not been for the wise judgment of the State Department in filing a suggestion of immunity in that case in clear violation of the Tate letter because it would have resulted in a most difficult and troublesome problem, the matter is discussed at great length and in my brief and in texts that I have referred to in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4570.904" offset="18366627">I think that it will appear clear there that the courts would have been placed in a intolerable position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4576.257" offset="18388047">Had it not been for the State Department for bailing it out with the suggestion of immunity?</text>

            <text syncTime="4641.529" offset="18649167">I was going to come to that and I will in a few minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4644.877" offset="18662542">I think that the necessity of having an escape hatch or door-out to save the court from really very serious embarrassment in the Naviera Vacuba situation, is an unfortunate thing and it would have been saved, had we had an absolute theory of sovereign immunity to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="4666.836" offset="18750418">We did not and therefore we had to find this alternative method.</text>
            <text syncTime="4670.029" offset="18763166">I think it would be better if we did not have to find it because we may not always have a State Department as alert to needs of the situation as existed at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.461" offset="18800887">In any event, I would have preferred not to have rely on Executive discretion concerned as it is as with many political considerations in the situation like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4694.400" offset="18860655">However, in closing on this point, I just want say what counsel has already refuted before I said it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4705.573" offset="18905376">I do not believe that the Doctrine of Act of State or the Doctrine of Sovereign Immunity is part of the arsenal of a trading nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4713.979" offset="18939022">I think that most trading nations rely upon act of state or sovereign immunity in only very rare situations and only when I suggest the political issue is somewhere hidden deep.</text>
            <text syncTime="4727.360" offset="18992521">I do not want to make this as an absolute rule but I would say that it is probably true as a generality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4731.833" offset="19010389">Only when there is a political issue which is hidden deep in the background of the case which makes it difficult to defend the case on other grounds and therefore the defendant must rely on one of these other defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4751.325" offset="19088338">The letter of the Legal Adviser in this case, it is not clear whether it is a part of the Justice Department's brief or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4761.114" offset="19127522">This Legal Adviser, unlike his predecessors in the Bernstein Case and in the City Bank Case, makes very broad pronouncements of State Departments’ Policy which look far into the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="4778.680" offset="19197739">The last sentence of his brief, for example is, it is our view that if the court should decide to overrule the holding in Sabbatino so that the act of state would thereafter be subject to adjudication in American Courts under International Law, we would not anticipate embarrassment to the conduct of the future policy of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.325" offset="19280390">We congratulate the State Department on its ability to see so clearly into the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="4804.565" offset="19301288">That talent was unfortunately not shared by its predecessor state department.</text>
            <text syncTime="4810.907" offset="19326679">The State Department in the Sabbatino case took a directly contrary position.</text>

            <text syncTime="5010.537" offset="20125190">I would suggest that that doctrine would be unnecessary if we had an absolute theory of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5021.799" offset="20170225">Since we have a restrictive theory of sovereign immunity which is for reasons that I have just set forth, I do not think that it is workable.</text>

            <text syncTime="5057.460" offset="20312854">As I said a few moments ago, the Sabbatino case held that the act of state doctrine will apply even when question at issue or act in question is alleged to be a violation of international law and therefore we met at the threshold were the problems, so far as this case is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="5274.933" offset="21182836">The District Court hands down a decision which says and Dunhill makes a demand that Dunhill paid this money by mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="5285.677" offset="21225781">Dunhill incidentally argued all the way through here that they had not paid the money by mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="5290.091" offset="21243440">That they were paying their debt and that was what they had to do and they did it and that is also in one of these petitions for certiori that is pending before you your honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5298.962" offset="21278862">But Dunhill said, now argue that well if we have to pay the former owners, then we paid the money by mistake and we want it back and so the court issued a decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="5310.225" offset="21324002">Well, a decree of the United States court does not transform an act of Cuba, done in Cuba from an act which is consistent with international law to an act which is inconsistent with international law.</text>

            <text syncTime="5480.183" offset="22003812">I would like to start by picking up Mr. Justice White’s comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="5484.981" offset="22022934">The reason that nobody in the courts below ever took up Cuba on the question of whether or not there had been some violation of international law was very simply that in our view, in the other parties of the case, no act of state was ever shown in the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="5503.531" offset="22097226">The only thing that we had on the record that was ever asserted as an act of state against the importers were statements by counsel talking of the repudiation that Cuba would not pay back to the importers, any judgments entered against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5522.151" offset="22171623">There was no act of state at that time asserted against the importers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5525.373" offset="22184580">There was nothing to which anyone could point and say that is a violation of international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5529.848" offset="22202447">The first time an act of state was defined really in this case was by the Court of Appeals and there for the first time, the suggestion was that it was the repudiation of the claim of the unjust enrichment claim of Dunhill that Cuba had evidenced through statements of counsel at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5552.562" offset="22293354">That we suggest, if the issue need be reached can constitute a violation of international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.814" offset="22318327">It is nothing more than a discriminatory taking of property belonging to Dunhill which erroneously found its way to Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="5567.146" offset="22351659">Now, if that property were the property of the owners rather than of Dunhill, as counsel for Cuba maintains, then the decree should have said, Cuba owes that money back to the owners, not the past that puts through with Dunhill in the untenable position that the court of appeals ruling has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="5588.392" offset="22436609">Let me return now again to the issue that I still consider critical and that is just precisely what the act of state was in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="5597.104" offset="22471509">I now gather that Cuba’s position is that the act of state was in fact the decree that everything that flowed, whether it was a taking of the money as it reached Cuba or whether it was a subsequent repudiation of the obligation, all of that arose from that somehow, ephemerally out of the original decree which seized the accounts but Dunhill is put in an absolutely untenable position by that reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="5622.704" offset="22573909">The Courts below have held that the decree was ineffective to seize the accounts and that therefore, when Dunhill paid the money to Cuba, it was paying the wrong party.</text>
            <text syncTime="5633.339" offset="22616436">That is precisely what has put Dunhill in the position that it now finds itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5637.709" offset="22633886">I suggest that for the court to find, that somehow on the act of state was the decree itself and charged Dunhill with that as a valid act of state unrelated to a commercial transaction, is to fly in the face of the key holdings of the courts below and not deal with all of the issues that are presented in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5659.133" offset="22719567">If the court is to get to the issue of whether or not that decree was the act of state, I see no way it can do it without granting or dealing at least with the other petitions for certiori and that includes both Cuba’s cross petition as well as the conditional cross petition of the importers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5679.742" offset="22802010">I would like to talk just for a minute about the comments that counsel for Cuba has made on the difference between the act of state and sovereign immunity and why is it inappropriate to apply the principles, one doctrine into the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="5694.615" offset="22861465">We suggested in our brief and we submit now that when you are dealing with a sovereign who was acting in a commercial context, the question of whether or not it can interpose sovereign immunity defense or act of state defense because it wants to repudiate that obligation has no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="5714.807" offset="22942235">I think this case illustrates it well, other cases certainly same is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="5720.671" offset="22965745">The question here is not whether an act of state is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="5724.256" offset="22980060">The only question here is whether the act of state asserted can be used as a defense to justify a repudiation of otherwise commercial transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5740.594" offset="23045471">I would like also to comment on the inability that the counsel for Cuba finds to make the distinction between the commercial and the political transaction which we have suggested in somewhat different terms in our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5755.135" offset="23103567">The fact that there are maybe difficult cases such as shoes for the military does not mean that the basic distinction between the commercial and political transactions can not be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5766.769" offset="23150170">Obviously, in this case, nobody would suggest that the purchase and sales of cigars was anything other than in a normal commercial transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="5780.436" offset="23204818">I would concede that that was a political transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5787.275" offset="23232194">By the same token, there are obviously easy cases on the other side where nobody would argue, that the act of the foreign state was clearly a political act unrelated to its commercial activities but with the volume of normal commercial activities being carried on by state trading agencies throughout the world today, it is foully to suggest that in most cases, one is not going to be able to say that this is a commercial transaction and should be treated, and the sovereign should be treated as though it is a party to a commercial transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="5833.038" offset="23415156">Let me comment on that, counsel for Cuba has suggested that we have perhaps abandoned the second argument on which we relied in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5845.218" offset="23463953">That is not so, I simply did not want to repeat our position in that regard and that you will recall deals with the questions of whether given the nature of these cases against the importers that they all can be treated as one for purposes of pool, and that would be one way and there maybe other ways --</text>

            <text syncTime="5887.163" offset="23631659">If you view the act of state as the retention of the payments pursuant to the decree as Cuba argued, I know you say we must grant your cert for petition, if we do that, but in that event, would the act be commercial or political?</text>

            <label>Mr. Victor S. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="5900.347" offset="23684426">In that event your honor, I would still hold that the act is commercial because to the extent that Cuba were to say that it was retaining payments made in the normal commercial sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5912.385" offset="23732596">I do not see any difference between the retention of payments or even if it were a decree saying we seize the payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="5919.111" offset="23759450">If that arises out of a course of commercial dealings, I see no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="5922.317" offset="23772302">Let me give a different example if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="5924.047" offset="23779198">Let us suppose that a transaction were an import transaction, where goods were going down to Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="5929.332" offset="23800410">It seems to me it makes no difference at that point, whether the foreign government says we refuse to pay for the goods or we seize the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="5936.887" offset="23830607">It is the same repudiation of a commercial transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5939.604" offset="23841474">I see my time is up.</text>
