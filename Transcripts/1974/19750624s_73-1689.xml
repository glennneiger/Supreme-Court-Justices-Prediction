            <text syncTime="12.427" offset="49633">In this case, we entertain an appeal from United States District Court for the Central District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.093" offset="80353">The Government commence this civil antitrust action in that court contending that the appellee, American Building Maintenance Industries, had violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring the stock of the J.E. Benton Management Corporation and by merging the Benton Maintenance Company into one of its wholly owned subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.300" offset="177110">Following discovery proceedings and the submission of memoranda and affidavits by both parties, the District Court granted the appellee's motion for summary judgment, holding that there had been no violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act because neither of the Benton companies was engaged in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.909" offset="259553">The Government then brought this direct appeal here and we noted probable jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.970" offset="287869">For the reasons set out on a written opinion of the Court, the judgement of the District Court is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.171" offset="312633">Mr. Justice White has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment and at all but -- but one part of the Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.251" offset="340950">Mr. Justice Douglas has filed a dissenting opinion which Mr. Justice Brennan has joined and Mr. Justice Blackmun has also filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
