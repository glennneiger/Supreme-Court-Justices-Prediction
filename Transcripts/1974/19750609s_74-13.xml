            <text syncTime="8.458" offset="33750">This case comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.409" offset="49633">Petitioners are the State of Maine and its prison warden.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.014" offset="68023">Respondent was convicted of murder under a Maine procedure that placed the burden on him to prove that he had acted in a heat of passion on sudden provocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.335" offset="117238">Only if he carried this burden could he reduce the charge of murder to manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.734" offset="142838">After exhausting his state remedies, respondent filed a writ of habeas corpus in the Federal District Court challenging the Maine procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.970" offset="179827">For the reasons stated in our opinion filed today, we hold that the imposition of this burden on respondent constituted a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.053" offset="224131">We follow this Court's decision in In re Winship which requires the prosecution in a criminal case to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every fact necessary to constitute the charge -- the crime charged.</text>
