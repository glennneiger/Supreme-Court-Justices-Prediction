            <text syncTime="38.381" offset="256920">My name is Bert Neuborne, I represent the petitioners herein Tom Ellis, a white college student at Eastville College in Dallas, Texas and Robert Love.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.508" offset="297357">A black graduate student at the Southern Methodist University School of Music.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.701" offset="318151">Petitioners were arrested at 2 a.m. on January 18, 1972 under a Dallas loitering ordinance while driving in Tom Ellis' car in the suburb of Dallas.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.393" offset="368933">At the time of their arrest, petitioners were attempting to determine which of several possible apartments that Mr. Love had looked at during the day would be most appropriate for Mr. Love to rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.813" offset="414595">Apart from the mere presence in the automobile at 2 o'clock in the morning in Dallas, Texas, there were no signs of criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.583" offset="449703">And obviously petitioners' arrest in the vague and overbroad Dallas ordinance upon which it was based raised serious constitutional questions under this Court's decision in Papachristou versus Jacksonville.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.851" offset="502784">Petitioners initially sought to raise the constitutional questions posed by the Dallas ordinance in the Texas state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.058" offset="535594">They first brought an application for discretionary writ of prohibition in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on February 14, 1972 and an application for discretionary writ was based on the facial unconstitutionality of the Dallas loitering ordinance.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.861" offset="806849">We have made preliminary attempts to trace them through their parents, and those preliminary attempts are thus far been unsuccessful although I must represent to the Court that the attempts have been preliminary.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.511" offset="853452">We suggest to the Court that under any circumstances whatever resolution of the issues posed by this appeal that on remand that the District Court just as in Steffel versus Thompson of the passage of three years renders it imperative that additional facts be taken by the District Court to determine whether or not a current case or controversy exists for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.662" offset="942059">I frankly, have no information concerning the current enforcement pattern of the Dallas ordinance nor have I sufficient information to discuss with the Court the current status of the petitioners with respect to the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.929" offset="991065">Of course, their arrests and conviction records remain and that would, I take it be unaffected by the present whereabouts.</text>

            <text syncTime="238.233" offset="1056266">I would think on remand -- under the disposition that we think the preferred disposition of this case would be a vacation of the orders below.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.944" offset="1103182">And a reconsideration in light of Steffel versus Thompson with a suggestion to the District Court that they undertake the same type of investigation that this Court suggested the Georgia District Court take in Steffel versus Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.935" offset="1147068">After presenting the discretionary writ of prohibition to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and having it denied on February 21st, petitioners then brought a motion -- a trial, a pretrial motion in the Dallas Municipal Court, the Corporation Court of Dallas in which they attack the facial unconstitutionality of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="291.974" offset="1271306">You don't know where they live in Dallas and you don't know whether they're disposed as to perhaps this litigation?</text>
            <text syncTime="298.049" offset="1295548">Your Honor, the contact which the Southern Methodist University Law Clinic has had with the clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.561" offset="1321566">The last contact which was a year ago indicated that they wish to present to continue with the litigation especially as it affects their arrest and conviction records.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.865" offset="1366810">I suggest to the Court had been at least as the arrest and conviction records of these young people both of whom were college students.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.866" offset="1398888">And who would be severely adversely prejudiced in their later lives by a conviction record such as this but there is at least a live controversy and an obligation upon the attorneys to continue to try to clear the records of these individuals and in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.072" offset="1467643">When the motion was dismiss in the Dallas Municipal Court the motion attacking the facial unconstitutionality of the statute, petitioners' counsel in the Municipal Court then faced a critical procedural decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.202" offset="1532217">And a procedural decision which, Your Honors, we suggest has shaped the subsequent course of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.370" offset="1560848">Petitioners' counsel at that point after this pretrial motion had been dismissed had two courses of action open to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.773" offset="1586448">First, he could have followed the more traditional course, which wouldn't have been to press the unconstitutionality of the Dallas Ordinance through the Texas courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.723" offset="1622288">That course of action had three serious disabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.046" offset="1643604">First, the Texas courts maintain a two-tier system of justice similar to the two-tier system of justice, which this Court sustained in Colten versus Kentucky two years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.123" offset="1691878">So that the price oppressing the petitioners' claims through the Texas Court System was the risk of a substantially increase sentence upon presentation in the trial de novo to a county court.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.256" offset="1744436">Indeed, it would have turned out that the potential risk would have been a 20-time -- a 20-fold increase in the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.302" offset="1768573">But secondly, and I think even more importantly in terms of a lawyer trying to do a good job for his client back in 1972, the procedural issue which the counsel for the petitioners faced in the Dallas court was he problem of issue preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.314" offset="1828655">If he continued to voluntarily present the constitutionality of the Dallas ordinance to the Texas state courts on a theory of issue preclusion, election of remedies, or res judicata, or some other type of theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.219" offset="1884244">He might have been deemed at that point where he did to continue to go to the merits and to reach the determination on the merits in the Dallas Municipal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.826" offset="1918725">He might have been barred from litigating the issue further in the federal courts at some subsequent point and that is precisely, Your Honors, what happened to counsel in Thistlethwaite versus New York which is reported at 497 F.2d 339 where they followed the more traditional rule and went up through the state court system on a challenging park permit regulation on which there was only a $5 fine and for which of course habeas corpus would probably not lie in a subsequent proceeding and when they had exhausted all their state traditional remedies and sought to raised the constitutionality of the New York City park permit statute as applied to prospective distributions of leaflets in the park.</text>

            <text syncTime="653.149" offset="2715982">And that's when 1983 actions are concerned there is at least a question as to whether or not res judicata should be applied when its full vigor to such a determination especially we're here it is being used as the functional equivalent in some part of the role that's played by federal habeas corpus in granting ultimate federal review and issues of criminal jurisprudence raising constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.254" offset="2816397">Third, we believe the that existence of the Texas two-tier system which would have missed -- which would have forced petitioners to risk a 20-fold increase in there sentence as the price of appealing from any adverse decision in the Texas Municipal Court cuts very heavily against precluding the petitioners from seeking a remedy to in federal court, while Texas under this Court's decision in Colten versus Kentucky may condition access to the Texas courts undergoing a trial de novo with the possibility of an increase sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.889" offset="2942934">We suggest it is a far crime from that to access -- to condition access to the federal courts under the Civil Rights Act of 1871 on the same requirement that you risk a substantially more severe sentence as the price for exercising the choice of forum rights which Congress determined to give to Civil Rights Litigants.</text>

            <text syncTime="2749.859" offset="11102856">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.699" offset="11110170">Merely on the case or controversy point the -- as we have understood at the case or controversy perimeter which this Court had laid down both in Steffel and earlier on Boyle versus Landry flowed somewhat like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.229" offset="11180283">In Steffel, there was direct threat to a direct person and that was held to give sufficient standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.497" offset="11205360">In Long Island Vietnam Moratorium versus Cahn which this Court affirmed last year there was generalized threat by a prosecutor to the public at large and that was sufficient to give standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.905" offset="11246947">In Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton there was a mere existence of the statutes themselves unaccompanied by any specific threat and that was held sufficient to give standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.970" offset="11283205">And in Epperson versus Arkansas, there was a discredited statute which been on the books -- which would not been enforced since 1928 and in Epperson, that was held sufficient to give standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.462" offset="11329181">We think that the petitioners at least in 19 -- in January of 1972 when the case or controversy was originally or March of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.817" offset="11366588">When the case or controversy was originally submitted to the federal court manifested as sufficient state, sufficient future arrest which was neither chimerical nor imaginary within the language of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.858" offset="11414758">In that, the only conduct which they have been guilty of was to be guilty of being on a Dallas Street at 2 o'clock in the morning in a car driving in the Dallas suburb.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.246" offset="11452374">They had no idea why they we're arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.265" offset="11460420">They had no idea what conduct on their part attribute the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.141" offset="11475884">Indeed, you had a statute sufficiently broad that would virtually invite dragnet and suspicion arrests, and if these people don't have standing to challenge the statute it would be virtually impossible to hypothesize anyone else to whom the statute might be applied who would have standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.539" offset="11549550">It's a very vice of a Dallas ordinance that it's so vague, so without standards but it's not directed particularly at anybody that there is a virtual grant of untrammeled discretion to the police to make whatever arrests they wish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.601" offset="11605765">Having been arrested under at once we think that wouldn't have been sufficient back in 1972 to determine whether or not there was a case controversy especially given the pattern, the recurrent patterns of enforcement which the Dallas police were engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.586" offset="11677759">Your Honor, we do not ask this Court all to substitute itself or the federal courts to substitute itself from appellate form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.763" offset="11706389">The only thing that we ask in this case, is that if a jurisdiction which permits nolo contendere is prepared to allow a criminal defendant to offer a nolo contendere to plea and to take the nolo contendere to plea that under general principles of nolo law that, that grants a benefit to the state and then it allows the state a speedy disposition of the particular proceeding and the imposition of sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.462" offset="11801266">On the other hand, the person who offered the nolo plea himself is attempting to reserve for himself the opportunity should have be appropriate to litigate the underlying legal issues in a Federal Court pursuant to the choice of form rules granted by the Civil Rights Act of 1871.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.699" offset="11866154">In fact, in candor the basis of our claim is that a nolo plea if accepted by an appropriate jurisdiction is the functional equivalent of a reserve under England versus Louisiana Board of Medical Examiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.155" offset="11919966">And is the attempt in a criminal litigation to reserve for a future time the opportunity to present underlying legal questions to a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.719" offset="11954239">The option whether we would accept it lays with the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.987" offset="11963329">The State was under no obligation to accept the nolo plea but they did so and under those circumstance we believed that the petitioners have not foreclose their rights to present the underlying legal issues at some appropriate times to a federal court.</text>
