            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">74-5054 and 74-453, are concerned with a New York regulation under which the rent allowance payable to a recipient of aid under the program of Aid to Families with Dependent Children is reduced when the recipient takes a non-paying lodger into the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.975" offset="107833">In No. 74-5054, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that this New York regulation does not conflict with the Federal Social Security Act and the regulations under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.951" offset="175752">We disagree and reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.107" offset="188395">Mr. Justice Rehnquist dissents and has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.532" offset="210024">In No. 74-453, a three-judge District Court in the Southern District of New York held that the New York regulation was unconstitutional because in violation of the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.615" offset="270420">In light of our decision in 74-5054, we have no occasion to address that or any constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.853" offset="307409">Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the three-judge District Court and remand with direction to dismiss the case to that extent as moot.</text>
