            <label>Mr. Harry Alan Sherman</label>
            <text syncTime="31.066" offset="227662">Mr. Chief Justice and members of Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.034" offset="239470">May I address myself as quickly as possible to the nature of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.943" offset="267160">This is an invasion of privacy and may I respectfully suggest that it's an invasion of four types of privacy in one continuous event or series of events.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.587" offset="345736">Although this is a contradicted by the circuit Court of Appeals, I believe I will point out that they are in error and by the brief of my distinguished and friendly opponent.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.097" offset="423790">The facts in this case are briefly these.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.935" offset="443120">The Silver Bridge, which was a span crossing the Ohio River from Point Pleasant, West Virginia to Colnago, Ohio and owned by the State of West Virginia collapsed on December 15, 1967 and 46 persons lost their lives in that disaster.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.666" offset="542072">One of the people that was a victim of the collapse was Melvin Aaron Cantrell, the deceased husband of Margaret May Cantrell, the widow who brings this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.441" offset="605184">None of the seven children of the Cantrell's was anywhere near the collapse of the bridge and was not involved in any of the news story that naturally followed that disaster.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.293" offset="668505">The period of time between the collapse and the publication of the story, feature article, not a news story, was about eight months, just a little short of eight months.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.032" offset="743528">A reporter of the Plain Dealer for City Publishing Companies paper and a young photographer came to the premises which incidentally were seven miles of a highway of a main highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.390" offset="824926">They had to cross a quarter of a mile of private land to get to the residents on the day of their visit.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.634" offset="861915">They were not invited.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.748" offset="874350">They were not -- they did not notify anyone that they were going to come on to the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.516" offset="901413">They walked into the living room door when the young fellow, 13 years old saw men walking across there land open the door to look out to see and they walked right in.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.283" offset="948537">This is the testimony of our plaintiff's witnesses; that is David Cantrell and the photographer Conway, one of the defendants, admittedly took 50 pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.451" offset="1025128">Now in an hour to an hour-and-half, now he took more that didn't come up but 50 that came out, this is admitted, so he was very busy taking pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.395" offset="1072985">Eszterhas the reporter supposedly talked to the older of the children in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.626" offset="1097853">What he said nobody knows because he never showed up at depositions, although he was noticed twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.709" offset="1130245">He was not at the trial and did not testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.630" offset="1149889">Conway testified that he did not ask any questions and he said the arrangements for him being in this private residence, he presumed were made by the city desk or the reporter, he had nothing to do with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.549" offset="1225540">So that we have nobody from the defense testifying as to the contents of the story which was a feature story.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.716" offset="1266186">Admittedly, several pages of a Sunday supplement magazine section of the paper with a little over 400,000 in circulation, several of this photographs that were taken like Conway on the visit were rather large.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.839" offset="1334732">They're in Exhibit II accompanied the article and showed that children all in the very, very pathetic like, all bear foot, all dirty bedraggled, all at home, the mother wasn't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.605" offset="1405785">The mother had not known that anyone was to come to their premises, did not invite anybody, did not agree to any interview of her children age two to 16 at that time, and they were told immediately that is the reporter and photographer as they walked into the living room that mother wasn't there, they didn't know when she would be back and the story was written as if on interviewing Mrs. Cantrell, even describing her pathetic appearance which is completely fictionalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.585" offset="1573700">They were a great number of false statements in the article.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.507" offset="1593448">Now, of course it so and aroused the community that there was an article printed in a Dayton publication exposing the fallacies, the falseness of the article that was printed in the Plain Dealer.</text>

            <text syncTime="413.969" offset="1759274">So that the suit was brought as an invasion of privacy action, and of course the issues presented briefly are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.357" offset="1824789">I set them forth in more detail in my brief, but first, when we when into trial, it was made clear that we were not trying a defamation or libel suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.694" offset="1870137">We were trying an invasion of privacy which incidentally involved also a publication, and Judge Krupansky made it very clear that it was not only the false like publication which was the basis of this action that Page 99 of the Volume I of the appendix at the top of the page, district Judge Krupansky said it is the conduct of the parties prior to and at the time of the incident that gives rise to the issues in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="636.394" offset="2648900">So, we were confined of actual damages and the jury verdict was $60,000.00, 45 for the mother; 15 for the boy.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.183" offset="2696129">The next issue that I'm raising is in such a case where we are really basing our concept of the case on the Supreme Court decisions, especially in Katz versus United States where this is -- we have the evolving law of privacy at the state level, and we are on a diversity basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.848" offset="2798738">Aren't we entitled to a Seventh Amendment right to jury trial to make a determination of the issues of fact?</text>
            <text syncTime="681.739" offset="2830294">And that's one of the issues that I raise on the appeal, and the last one -- and this one, I think is devastating when the Sixth Circuit says that when there is a conflict between the right of privacy admitted and the Freedom of the press, the right of privacy must give way to Freedom of the press because right of privacy is mentioned in the constitution, and Freedom of the press is, this is the wording of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.505" offset="2973341">So that that's another issue that I raise and I believe in all fairness to my opponent, I should tell you the issues as the respondents have raised them.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.123" offset="3019839">First of all in their brief in opposition to the grant of certiorari, they raise one question, should certiorari be granted in an action for invasion of privacy based upon the publication of an article concerning a matter of public interest where the lower courts correctly applied the constitutional standard in accordance with the controlling cases of this Court, and where the lower courts found no evidence of known falsity or reckless disregard of the truth?</text>
            <text syncTime="759.224" offset="3140315">Now, that's not the exactly what the court found.</text>

            <text syncTime="764.443" offset="3161109">The jury found that there was a reckless disregard, but then in their brief, they say very simply, does the First Amendment protect publication of a non-defamatory newsworthy article from a claim for false light invasion of privacy absent proof of calculated falsehood?</text>

            <text syncTime="1721.036" offset="6987525">And while she is away at work, her family is intruded upon and is exposed, hung up to dry because some young enterprising creative fiction writer decided to make a microcosm out of the Cantrell family's experience for all the world to believe that all of the families had the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.903" offset="7074983">Now may I in closing just call Your Honors' attention to the very important case, Stanford versus States of Texas, where the Supreme Court points out very definitely the history of how we got personal liberty before the constitution, how we got privacy before the constitution and the two English cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.995" offset="7175398">And here which wiped out writs of assistance and similar warrants that gave broad authority to the ages ago into any body’s home and search for evidence and to deny any privacy to anybody, and here where the Sixth Circuit Court in 1974 cowed by what the law had become under the confusion following the New York Times versus Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.709" offset="7286157">I respectfully say that was only that granting a license to private reporters and photographers, the second word is even more ominous than the first, to do the same thing that was wiped out 200 years ago before we became a nation and let them have any access without any answerability in damages in the court of law in the United States.</text>
