            <text syncTime="29.155" offset="220035">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.011" offset="235395">This case is here on direct appeal by the government from the judgment of a three-judge district court in the Southern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.719" offset="270294">The court enjoined the Navy's discharge of Lieutenant Ballard and declared the statute requiring his discharge unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.410" offset="304985">Lieutenant Ballard claims and the court below found that the Navy's basic separation statute discriminates against men in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.358" offset="348766">That statute requires Lieutenant Ballard's discharge because he was twice passed over for promotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.549" offset="377605">Although he had less than 10 full years of commissioned service.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.482" offset="405295">A special statute applicable to certain woman Lieutenants provides for their discharge after 13 years of service if they're not selected for promotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.782" offset="450539">This three year difference is the basis of the claim of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.544" offset="481573">I think it's important to point out in the first that the different treatment doesn't turn simply on sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.575" offset="517622">In the course, where woman and man fill substantially the same types of jobs, for instance, the judge advocate general core, the medical core and the dental core all officers are subject to the basic statute requiring separation if they are twice passed over for promotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.478" offset="601318">Similarly nurses men and women are subject to a 13 years statute similar to the one that applies to the line lieutenant.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.744" offset="662340">The special 13 years statute applies to women line lieutenants and certain staff women.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.364" offset="700792">These women are competing for jobs against men line lieutenants but the statute provides that women may not serve on naval vessels except hospital ships and transport ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.233" offset="796296">Therefore, the jobs that the women are subject to a special statute made fill are significantly different than the jobs that are -- many of the jobs that are filled by the men line lieutenants.</text>

            <text syncTime="193.864" offset="878843">Yes, I believe that is not basically in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.345" offset="912802">Both the special 13 years statute and the basic statute providing for a separation after being twice passed over reflect the special military philosophy.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.356" offset="972779">In civilian life, if you are reasonably good at your job you can normally expect to keep it even if you're not promoted but in the military that sort of competence is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.735" offset="1026278">In this instead, in the military every officer is periodically compared with his peers.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.539" offset="1053550">Those best qualified are promoted, the others are separated.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.664" offset="1074030">This is a very tough system but it was developed after World War 2 to meet the special military need to have the best possible officers available for command.</text>

            <text syncTime="363.402" offset="1556982">And this is no less true because a different rule applies to a particular small group of officers whose special circumstances justify this different treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="591.519" offset="2469491">The basic procedures are those designed by congress to assure the selection of the best qualified officers for military command.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.869" offset="2510869">This is exactly the kind of congressional choice that is entitled to great difference since it is so closely related to the navy's ability to fight effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.572" offset="2569697">The basic rule requiring the separation of officers who've been twice passed over for promotion is not as the court below believed basically a fiscal or administrative provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.652" offset="2614000">Instead, it's a means of assuring a high quality of the pool from which eligible officers are chosen.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.505" offset="2645347">All officers eligible for promotion are annually evaluated against their peers.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.921" offset="2671052">The best are promoted but the quality of the pool from which future officers must be selected must also be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.935" offset="2703130">Therefore, those officers who have served long enough to show that they are not qualified for promotion must be witted out.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.975" offset="2735313">In that way, there's additional space in the pool for new officers to enter.</text>

            <text syncTime="667.708" offset="2774183">In other words, the effect of the two passover procedure or the prompt separation of those not selected for promotion is that you don't just skim the cream off the eligible pool but you also take off the bottom layer so that the quality of the pool remains constant.</text>

            <text syncTime="719.998" offset="2983372">The point of which the witting occurs is defined in two different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.611" offset="3009808">The basic provision applies to most officers including unrestricted line officers and to men and women in most of this stay of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.730" offset="3054320">It requires separation after the officer has been twice passed over.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.352" offset="3068740">That's not a statute that operates as the district court believed on the turn of the calendar.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.327" offset="3088697">The determination of women officers has been passed over involves the exercise a very substantial military judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.096" offset="3119731">Since being passed over does not mean simply that an officer was eligible for promotion but was not selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.540" offset="3145540">Instead it means that he served long enough so that the fact that he is not selected should be counted against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.314" offset="3172603">The determination of when that point occurs is a very complex one.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.799" offset="3190575">It requires balancing the very needs of the service for officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.038" offset="3211473">The manpower needs from year to year and the desirability of having a large enough group from which to select the officers against the need to treat the people equally from year to year.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.156" offset="3271973">There really are two important points in this procedure as the need for combat officers increases in national emergencies, the length of service before promotion decreases.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.402" offset="3320978">That length is currently about 9 years as opposed to peacetime goal of 12 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.369" offset="3352848">Secondly, the increased need for officers places a heaver drain on the pool of officers eligible for promotion and makes it increasingly important to assure the high quality of the pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.278" offset="3404466">One way of doing that is by the prompt separation of those passed over, since the current promotion rate is 70% to 85% those who like Lieutenant Ballard are passed over twice are less qualified on 70% to 85% of their peers.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.123" offset="3479907">Their separation improves the quality of the pool by making spaces in the pool available to others who have not yet been evaluated.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.759" offset="3518360">The effect of the decision below is to delay the separation of these least qualified officers for about three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.515" offset="3561409">Since about 200 lieutenants subject to the basic rule are passed over for the second time each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.336" offset="3588681">The potential effect of the decision under current conditions would be that about 600 such officers would have to be retained in the pool of eligible lieutenants.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.986" offset="3639359">That means again that about 1900 officers in the lower grades who've not been evaluated would have to be separated.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.113" offset="3679796">Of course, if the conditions change so that the length, the normal length of service is shorter or that the promotion rates drop then the number of officers in the deleterious effect on the pool would be increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.105" offset="3763806">In any event the pool of eligible officers is permanently degraded and the caliber of officers at all higher levels inevitably suffers.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.669" offset="3806020">The 13 year rule which is as I have noted, applicable to certain woman officers was intended to provide for them lengths of service, roughly equivalent to those anticipated for the vast majority of officers under peacetime conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1463.602" offset="5957778">And the 13 year rule serves to counteract these disadvantages to some extent by giving the women somewhat more job security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.774" offset="6002500">As a matter of policy, the navy has concluded that the 13 year rule for woman is no longer necessary since promotion rates are now equal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2119.546" offset="8581517">We're not questioning selection of procedures, I'm talking about the situation where there is a rational basis or compelling interest to have different treatment or women as opposed to men, and they talk about a combat needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.684" offset="8638151">In other words, a tremendous increase of combat individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.119" offset="8651839">Well from my own experience, that whenever you have an increase and necessity of getting combat individuals the support people are needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.108" offset="8683813">For every combat individual there are three or four individuals who have to support that individual and so this need of -- this expanding of the service cuts across just the males, it cuts across that and into the women also and of course, basically all the government's argument here is that because this may cause some fiscal inconvenience to the navy, then what makes it the military necessity and there is a compelling interest to have disparate treatment between men and women.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.250" offset="8840338">And we can't argue backwards and say because it's hard and it maybe hard, and I'm conceding that it is because as I was talking to Justice Marshall, we don't know exactly how many people would opt to take advantage of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.102" offset="8903764">The women have the extra the 13 years, Lieutenant Ballad obviously is opting to take advantage of that because he can retire but it's going to be a very small number of in generally mustangs as Justice Stewart says, and that's the name that the Navy uses individuals who have been enlisted men and then go into the officer ranks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.377" offset="9004910">And I want to respond to the -- it was very clear and the Court below found after trial that this is a very highly qualified officer and on substantial evidences, this was a very highly qualified officer and his fitness reports were outstanding and during the period of time at the temporary restraining order he did very well and there were additional fitness reports were submitted by his command showing that they recommended him for promotion every time and so it is --</text>
