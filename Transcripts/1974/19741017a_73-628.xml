            <text syncTime="14.730" offset="162252">Thank you Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.009" offset="167372">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.871" offset="182836">What this case involves is whether the State of Mississippi can require foreign corporations to obtain a license to buy cotton in Mississippi and ship it from the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.962" offset="227244">My client, the Allenberg Cotton Company, buys cotton in the State of Mississippi without having any employees in the state, without an office in the state, without owning any warehouses in the state, and without even paying for the cotton in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.072" offset="287640">And he buys that cotton for the purpose of shipping every bale of cotton that he buys out of the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.825" offset="310627">Allenberg made the contract that's involved here following an industry pattern which has been established over the last 100 or more years, like almost every other cotton merchant in the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.375" offset="360887">Allenberg bids for the cotton over the telephone in a prior year, they did this over the telegraph and it submits those bids to local cotton brokers all over the south and makes contracts in that manner without qualification to do business in the various states where bids are submitted and contracts are made.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.683" offset="434134">This pattern of activity follows a pattern which has been protected under the Commerce Clause, particularly in the agriculture merchandizing industry as shown in the decisions of Dahnke-Walker Milling Company, Lemke versus Farmers Grain Company and Shafer versus Farmers Grain Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.532" offset="501530">All of which established the rule that making purchases to back commodities for shipment out of a state is an activity which is exempted from state licensing and qualification requirements by the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.513" offset="557432">This principle was articulated recently by this Court in the Eli Lilly decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.210" offset="580211">In that decision, all men of the justices recognized the principle that Commerce Clause guarantees free access to all markets in the United States and that as long as a foreign corporation limits it since activities in a state to those essential activities which a necessary to transact business in interstate commerce, that corporation should be free from local licensing of qualification requirements.</text>

            <text syncTime="160.411" offset="744991">What Allenberg did in this case fits into a very well established industry pattern and in of the pattern of existing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.921" offset="779055">In January 1971, Pittman, a substantial Mississippi cotton planter went to a local cotton broker and I asked him to get a certain price for his cotton.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.622" offset="821896">The local cotton broker picked up the phone and telephones the Allenberg Cotton Company in Memphis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1957.963" offset="7935248">The argument is that this company has relayed upon this Court oppressment, Dahnke-Walker, Shafer, and what not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1980.759" offset="8026363">And the reliance by this company on this Court's oppressment is again pointed to by the fact that the Dahnke-Walker case wasn't spotted until a petition for rehearing was filled at Mississippi Supreme Court decide against Allenberg Cotton Company, which brings up the question of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.277" offset="8108492">You have a December the 17 certificate outstanding right now requesting that a full certificate be secured from Mississippi Supreme Court that federal question was raised in adequate state ground on exist their certificates later.</text>
