            <text syncTime="192.223" offset="768836">Now, going back in time to May 1, 1954, and I might say that this was substantially before the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was enacted in the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.594" offset="834351">It was substantially before the “one man-one vote rule” rule that was decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.252" offset="856921">The City of New Orleans adapted a reorganization of its city government.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.775" offset="874998">It adapted a City Charter which was called the Home Rule Charter and which adapted the mayor council type of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.276" offset="917002">It established for the first time a mayor who was -- had the primary -- primarily responsibility of being the executive of the city and had established a City Council with the primary the legislative functions.</text>

            <text syncTime="242.507" offset="969979">That was on May 1, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.768" offset="995056">The Home Rule City Charter established a City Council as the legislative body, consisting of two members who would be elected at large, that is, by the entire city, by the entire population of the City of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.153" offset="1056601">It also established five single-member districts so that the entire City Council, the legislative body consisted of seven members, two elected at large, five elected from individual districts within the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.602" offset="1130371">Now, the city charter, the Home Rule Charter, adapted in May 1, 1954 had another provision and that was an another important provision, and that important provision made it mandatory for the City Council to redistrict itself, that is, the five individual districts after every decennial census.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.829" offset="1231308">This was an attempt to -- to require that each single-member district would be made up of, as closely as possible, an equal number of voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.180" offset="1280627">In 1961, following the first decennial census after the adaption of the Home Rule Charter, the City Council did in fact redistrict itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.150" offset="1336529">Now, at that time, there were no challenges to the redistricting and members were elected from the five individual districts and also, of course, from the two at large districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.831" offset="1415314">In 1969, the present City Council of the City of New Orleans was elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.909" offset="1439556">They took office on May 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.125" offset="1456483">Of course, 1970 was a census year and under the requirement of the City Charter, the City Council was required to redistrict the five districts following that census and prior to the next election which would have been held under normal schedules in the fall of 1973 with the elected officials to take office in May of 1974.</text>

            <text syncTime="412.946" offset="1651775">Now, in 1965 the Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and its application to the change of the redistricting is not attached -- is not attacked in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.549" offset="1718126">Everyone admits that it was the City Council, having redistricted itself following the -- that Act was required to submit it -- submit the plan to the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.298" offset="1777162">Now, the City Council adopted a plan of redistricting.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.601" offset="1794403">It held public hearings, extensive public hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.467" offset="1805793">During the extensive public hearings, it was evident that large segments of the community felt that the size of the City Council should be increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.586" offset="1854276">The council adopted a plan to increase the size of the City Council from seven members to eleven members, retaining two at large and electing -- proposing to elect nine members from single-member districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.258" offset="1925016">This was submitted to the electorate, it was defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.330" offset="1937241">Again, the City Council adapted another plan whereby the City Council would be enlarged from a seven-member council to a nine-member council, two to be elected at large, seven from single-member districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.240" offset="1984888">This plan was presented to the electorate, it was defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.196" offset="2000771">Now, at that point, the City Council was faced with the mandatory requirement that it redistrict itself and that it redistrict itself in accordance with a seven-member council which was the law, it having submitted the -- the eleven-member proposal and the nine-member proposal to the electorate having been -- having been defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.874" offset="2091468">At that time, the City Council adapted plan II, and plan II is the plan which is now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.200" offset="2132741">It submitted the plan to the Attorney General for approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.400" offset="2145593">The Attorney General did not approve the plan and whereupon the City Council, believing that the plan was a reasonable and rational plan for redistricting itself, filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia asking for a declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.844" offset="2223334">That court -- that court denied the request for the declaratory judgment, and it is from that decision which we have appealed and which brings this case to the Court at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.773" offset="2267011">Now, may I refer the Court to page 621 of the appendix which shows a map of the City of New Orleans and the districts, various districts as they were established in 1961, and indeed, which -- which is the present district plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="606.348" offset="2425313">I mentioned in my opening statement the geography is involved in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.331" offset="2441300">If you will look at the City of New Orleans, you will see that one of the predominant geographic features is the Mississippi River which flows through the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.937" offset="2479647">There is only one part of the city that is west of the Mississippi and that in the plan which I refer to, is a part identified (a) part, and that is -- that section of the city is -- is west of the Mississippi and is known as the Algiers section.</text>

            <text syncTime="655.363" offset="2621440">Let me say that there is substantial evidence in the record which shows that the citizens of Algiers were very interested in having a bridge across the Mississippi River.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.387" offset="2661460">They wanted some way to get, I should say another bridge, they wanted some way to get from the Western part of the city on the west side of the Mississippi to the central and main part of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.651" offset="2710570">The many citizens across the river that is in the main section of the city were opposed to this and this was a very -- very hotly debated issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.483" offset="2761874">Many people wanted the bridge to be somewhere -- somewhere else in some other section of the city so that this factor was an important factor in considering the reapportionment, the redistricting of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.269" offset="2840973">Referring to page 624, which is likewise a map of the city and which shows plan II, plan II which is the plan presented before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.075" offset="2904294">You will note that in the plan that has been adapted, as plan II, the section in Algiers is connected with a contiguous area across the Mississippi River so that section -- so that District C comprises the entire Algiers section of the city as well as some of the riverfront section of the city and up into the major downtown area of the city and in fact, running to Lake Pontchartrain which is at the very top of the -- of the page.</text>

            <text syncTime="905.101" offset="3620362">Now, this was the plan that was presented to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and this was the plan out of which has come the -- the appeal which we have before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.855" offset="3683370">The most important aspect of the error which the District Court made was its error in holding that the two at large seats on the City Council were affected by and must be included in any plan that is considered under the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.066" offset="3804264">Now, we submit that this was patently wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="1000.861" offset="4003422">I believe that is -- that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.004" offset="4011990">So that we submit that the lower Court erred in holding that the two at large seats were changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.080" offset="4044278">We submit that there was in effect a -- a two-segment voting procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.947" offset="4075729">One was electing two council members at large and the other was electing five members from single-member districts divided in equal population numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.664" offset="4130586">We submit that the at large seats are not in any way affected by this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.309" offset="4153156">We submit that they are not affected by the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and that they should not be considered and the court erred and substantially erred in holding that the two at large seats were affected by the redistricting plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.258" offset="4220970">Now, I might point out that the two at large seats, in addition to their regular responsibilities as council members, have other responsibilities that are prescribed by the charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.554" offset="4290142">For instance, the chairmanship of the City Council rotates every four months between the two members at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.659" offset="4318563">Furthermore, the two members at large sit on various city -- city agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.890" offset="4355553">One is the reduction of debt, that is not the correct term, but it is described in -- in our brief, the Stadium Commission, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.697" offset="4394736">So that the two members at large have somewhat different responsibilities and -- responsibilities that are over and above the responsibilities of all the other members of the -- of the City Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.023" offset="4444056">So that in effect, the plan, and again I must -- I cannot emphasize too strongly that this is the plan that was adapted back in 1954, long before the Voting Rights Act and long before any -- any other attacks and that plan incidentally was never attacked by any voter to my knowledge, that claimed that there was something constitutionally wrong with the city charger adapted in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.141" offset="4548545">It had never been attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.869" offset="4555442">Now, in this respect, this case is different than many other cases that have come before this Court under the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.172" offset="4600686">This is not a case where a city has gone out in the next land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.399" offset="4621584">It is not a city where -- it is not a case where a city has changed its basic philosophy of electing its legislative unit or legislative body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.128" offset="4672470">It is a case where there has been no change of any kind in the City Charter and in the establishment of the this City Council, except that following the mandatory requirement that the charter required, namely that every 10 years, after every decennial census it must redistrict itself so that each of the single-member districts are divided as nearly as possible into districts of equal population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.462" offset="4805799">So, I submit to the Court that this case is different than other cases that have come before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.616" offset="4826384">It is not a case where there is any attempt or any blatant attempt or any apparent attempt or any so-called attempt to change or to -- to the city form of government or to change an election procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.242" offset="4896914">It is merely changing a district, the districts of the five individual districts, as is required by the forward-looking, and I submit it was a forward-looking City Charter that was adapted in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.736" offset="4950936">So, the case is unique and the case is different from other cases that have come before the Court in that respect and the only matter before the Court is whether or not the five-member plan, as encompassed in plan II, is a reasonable plan and a rational plan that does not violate the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and does not deny or abridge the right of any citizen to cast his vote in a municipal election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.198" offset="5076741">Now, we submit that the Court below erred in its application of the -- of the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.590" offset="5114358">We say that the proper test to be applied to this plan is whether or not it is a reasonable plan, whether or not it is a rational plan, whether or not it is based on reasonable considerations that a City Council should take into consideration when it adapts a plan of redistricting itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.323" offset="5201189">We have set forth the criteria, which have been used in our brief, which were used in adapting the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.635" offset="5238491">I might say parenthetically that traditionally, the districts of the various -- the lines of the various districts have run in a north-south manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.154" offset="5284571">Now, this is not happenstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.718" offset="5294811">The City of New Orleans I guess, as we all know, is built basically on a swamp land and in recapturing the land, numerous canals were built to take away the excess water and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.112" offset="5348415">Now, these canals basically run in a north-south position -- direction and they basically run from the Lake Pontchartrain area to the Mississippi River, to the Mississippi River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.451" offset="5401704">If you will note the 1961 plan, the 1961 plan runs in a north-south direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.762" offset="5442978">Indeed, the old ward lines in the city ran in a north-south direction and I believe those wards were established in the late 1800s or early 1900s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.789" offset="5483102">So that, traditionally, in the city, the main arteries of the city and I am talking canals and in later years, the -- the streets, the predominant streets do run in a north-south area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.640" offset="5542557">The plan has great basis in reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.562" offset="5586233">It has followed the traditional lines of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.025" offset="5600026">It has followed the traditional movement of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.162" offset="5616640">It has taken into consideration the important economic interest of the Mississippi River and the commerce and -- and jobs that it produces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.560" offset="5654152">In addition to that, referring again to the population spread, I must point out that the Black population is spread throughout the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.996" offset="5699918">It is not a population that is concentrated in one area of the city as we all know, happens in many of our great urban areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.029" offset="5728026">Rather, the Black population is spread throughout the city and I submit that, indeed, the plan that is before the Court is a plan which has members of the council representing Black voters, representing White voters, representing the interests of the Mississippi River, representing the interest of the Lake Pontchartrain area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.690" offset="5806707">It is a diversified interest, and I submit that in a plan of government, this is a strength.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.464" offset="5837845">It is the strength of the system and may, in fact, be the genius of the mayor council form of government, namely adapted by the City of New Orleans, namely it has the two at large seats which represent all of the people and are answerable to all of the people of the City of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.480" offset="5913913">In addition to that, it has single-member districts which are answerable to the people within that district, but at the same time, rather than being answerable only to one segment of the society and one segment of the community, they are answerable to a broad, a spread of interests, and therefore, it would appear that members of the council who are answerable to broad segments of the population that are answerable to broad economic interest, broad social interest will together provide a better government, a better form of government than will a number of members on a City Council, each of one of whom -- each of one of whom is answerable to a very tight segment of the population and we submit that this is one of the great strengths of a plan that has been submitted and is -- is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.514" offset="6129998">Now, the lower Court made one other serious error that -- that we feel is important and should be brought to the attention of the Court at this time in addition to those fully expressed in our brief and that is that the District Court has said that the burden of proof on the city is the burden of proving that the plan presented is the “only plan that is feasible.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.476" offset="6245878">We submit that this is a proper -- improper burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.442" offset="6257685">We submit that in a declaratory judgment the preponderance of the evidence should be the test that no reasonable person can assume that in the myriad problems evolved in a redistricting that there can be only one plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.647" offset="6322573">We submit that the Court erred in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.694" offset="6334694">Mr. Chief Justice, may I reserve a few moments for rebuttal?</text>

            <text syncTime="1603.332" offset="6413270">The first is a very narrow issue, addressed in our supplemental brief, and that is whether the continued existence of the two at large seats was a matter requiring pre-clearance under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.432" offset="6481711">As we explained in our supplemental brief, we take a generous view of what constitutes the change that requires review under Section 5, but we do not -- we do not take a view that stretches this far because there is no reconsideration or re-adaption of the two at large seats and their status in voting strength on the City Council, on the seven-member council, remains unchanged.</text>

            <text syncTime="1706.612" offset="6826423">We think the question of the two at large seats is an extremely narrow one here.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="1759.480" offset="7037910">I think that was the District Court’s approach to attempting to assess whether the plan has the purpose or would have the effect of abridging the right to vote, and one way to answer that is to look to the concerns that the city had in adapting its districting and see whether those concerns could have been met without the dilution of minority voting strength that resulted from the plan proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.822" offset="7159223">And in this case, I think the Court quite probably looked to the alternatives that were reflected in the record to show that the city’s general objectives could be as well complied with without the effect on minority voting strength that occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.086" offset="7248248">And, that brings me to the principal issue in the case, the one discussed in our principal brief, and on that our starting point is the Court’s decision in Georgia against the United States holding that the Act does protect against dilution of minority voting strength through redistricting and by dilution, and there is some confusion in the testimony about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.699" offset="7362769">We do not believe “by dilution” we mean a comparison with how the minority voters were treated under the preceding redistricting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.789" offset="7419089">We do not think either the Attorney General or the District Courts are in the business under this Act of measuring comparative abridgments of the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.602" offset="7470393">The Act was designed to enforce the provisions of the Fifteenth Amendment, and the proper inquiry is whether there has been a reduction of voting strength in comparison with the way other members of the society are treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.627" offset="7554508">I do not think we could articulate it differently for purposes of Section 5 and this Court articulated it in White against Regester and Whitcomb against Chavis in a quotation which appears on page 15 of our principal brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2378.394" offset="9513482">Well, let me try to say something which is that we think the standard for multi-member districts developed in these cases has to be the same standard that applies to single-member districts and we would illustrate that with a hypothetical that if, for example, New Orleans were changed to a City Council with seven members, all elected at large, that obviously would satisfy Fourteenth Amendment standards and yet there would be a substantial basis saying that the standards of White against Regester could be shown to have been violated by such a districting and yet, it seems to us the result would be the same that instead of the seven at large members, the city would divide it into seven districts so drawn and this would be theoretically possible although difficult, that each district contains exactly the same proportion of Black and White voters as the city at large, roughly 35% Black and 65% White.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.425" offset="9813682">It -- it seems to us that you would have the same result in terms of dilution of minority voting strength which is what we read the White and Whitcomb cases to involve a standard for determining what constitutes dilution of minority voting strength that is to provide the guidance for assessing plans submitted under Section 5 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.613" offset="9926426">Now, what was done here was nothing quite so crude as to draw the districts in a way that each one would reflect exactly the proportion of voting strength of the minority group in the city as a whole, but it approaches that because as you will notice in studying the plan and I am sorry my time is expiring here, in each of the districts except one, the Blacks are merged into a district in which a majority of Whites has been put into the district by extending the district in several cases from Lake Pontchartrain to the southern extremity of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.528" offset="10126106">This was done to perpetuate a system of districting of the city which may have been quite understandable at a time when the Blacks spread throughout the middle of the city were not voting, were not registered, were not being allowed to register to vote and it was necessary to have some voters in each district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.451" offset="10209802">So, the districts were elongated in that fashion, but it seems to us, as it did to the District Court, inappropriate to attempt to perpetuate it in the present context in light of the particular findings of the District Court which we elaborate in our brief, involving a prevalent pattern of block voting, difficulties in getting responsiveness from the City Council to the needs of the Black community, whether those problems involve employment in the city government, adequate park streets, recreational facilities in the Black neighborhoods, etcetera.</text>

            <text syncTime="2754.007" offset="11015941">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.281" offset="11029107">There were a number of questions posed by the Court to which our answer is a bit different and I would like to -- to just move right into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.035" offset="11064111">I would like to point out to the Court that it is our position that the Section 5 standard involved here is considerably more stringent than the standard of White v. Regester or Whitcomb versus Chavis and that the inquiry, the proper inquiry of a court under Section 5 is considerable more limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.219" offset="11136836">Specifically, we point out, of course as we have in our brief, that Congress has just reenacted Section 5 for an additional seven years with a specific intention to have the Act cover redistricting for the 1980 census.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.018" offset="11204023">Congress is particularly concerned and I think the hearings and the testimony and so forth indicate that it is particularly concerned that in these areas where racial discrimination continues to be practiced, that the newly enfranchised Black voters will be effectively disenfranchised by a line-drawing districting which will divide up Black concentrations in these areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.171" offset="11324604">I think that, specifically this was the matter that Section 5 sought to remedy, in this type of case, a line-drawing redistricting case and the inquiry should be a narrow one and that is whether there is a significant concentration of Black voting strength and whether or not a districting plan divides up that population and spreads it out into predominantly White districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.650" offset="11426586">I think that is the inquiry and I think that is exactly what is before the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.706" offset="11450723">You have significant Black concentrations of populations in New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.903" offset="11467546">In spite of what Mr. Stoner has suggested, you can walk from Jefferson Parish throughout the city for eight or ten miles to the St. Bernard Parish line and not see a White face along that band, that Black belt, that parallels the river in curved fashion throughout the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.212" offset="11536823">White people live in the very wealthy sections of town out by the lake and along St. Charles Avenue to the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.264" offset="11565035">The rest is left over for Blacks and these are heavy concentrations, and that plan devised by the City Council slices up that population like so many pieces of baloney and that is what Congress intended for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.754" offset="11614981">Now, to the inquiry as to how do you compare to previous plans or what do you compare to, I think Section 5 is -- Congress is very explicit that there is one triggering device.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.189" offset="11660748">When you have a voting change, then Section 5 is triggered, is brought into effect and then the inquiry becomes as to whether or not the matter is -- is racially discriminatory or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.146" offset="11712575">In redistricting cases, particularly because you have operation to the one man-one vote mandate, you do not have anything to go back to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.699" offset="11746743">You do not have a previous plan that you can really compare to like you do in an annexation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3074.397" offset="12297509">I think it is quite clear on the feasibility issue that this is -- that this was what Congress meant in this type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.085" offset="12332304">The standard here that I believe is quite clear that Congress has mandated under Section 5 has some very practical feasible effects as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="3097.050" offset="12388101">I do not think the government has really suggested a clear standard as to what Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.216" offset="12408790">Mr. Stoner has suggested just a general rationality standard which I suggest would open up the floodgates to all sorts of rationalizations to justify any type of discriminatory plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.859" offset="12455393">The standard, I believe, that Congress provided, when feasible not dividing Black population communities would be -- have certain administrative advantages in that the Court would not have to make the in-depth sort of inquiry, as was done in White versus Regester and so on, into some very sticky political and social issues as to whether Blacks are better off in a majority or a minority and the like, but rather the administration would rather simply would also provide fairly clear guidelines to city such as New Orleans when they are attempting to -- to draw a plan which would not fall afoul of Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.627" offset="12642429">And, it of course also leaves this area properly, I think in Congress’ hands. Congress is setting up a limited remedy that is limited in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.016" offset="12687987">It is going to expire in 1982 to provide for this particular problem that it found to exist and that was the division of Black population by district lines.</text>

            <text syncTime="3223.863" offset="12895399">They other side of that, the remedy would be in future plans not to so divide up the Black population concentrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.822" offset="12923193">Now, that is going to have certain effects which to some extent are going to be predictable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.831" offset="12951301">For instance, in New Orleans, if you do not divide up those Black concentrations, you are likely going to come out with 2 out of 5 or 3 out of 7 districts, but that is not what is compelled.</text>

            <text syncTime="3409.895" offset="13639576">I do not know if that is necessarily relevant, but in fact, it is not for a number of reasons and the figures in the tables might sort of lead to that conclusion, but they are misleading because in 1961, only 17% of the registered voters of New Orleans were Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.130" offset="13716480">In 1972, when we were -- we were in District Court, something like 38% of the registered voters in the town are Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.039" offset="13760052">So, it does not make a whole lot of difference perhaps in 1961 as to what happens because Blacks simply were not allowed to register and vote, but it does make a difference now that because of the operation of other provisions of the Voting Rights Act, Blacks have been allowed to register and vote in significant numbers and now they are divided up so that they are -- they are still cut off from the political process and they still have no effective voice in what city does.</text>

            <text syncTime="3623.480" offset="14493884">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.904" offset="14507572">There are two important issues that I shall like to respond to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.230" offset="14524918">One, there has been a statement and that appears also in the briefs and it appears in the lower Court’s decision that the two at large seats automatically go to the White population.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.690" offset="14570684">And, as basis for this, the lower Court refers to the fact that there never has been a Black elected to the City Council of the City of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.965" offset="14599837">Alright, I submit that number one, there has not been an election in the City of New Orleans since 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.777" offset="14631079">Furthermore, the record clearly shows that Blacks have one substantial -- elections to substantial positions in the City of New Orleans and I refer to the election of Judge Muriel who was elected to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on a citywide basis in the City of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.720" offset="14750824">He is a Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.228" offset="14750720">I refer to Judge Israel Augustine who is elected to the Criminal District Court in the entire City of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.671" offset="14754586">I refer to Dr. Spears who is a Black educator and who was elected on a citywide basis to the New Orleans Parish School Board and indeed was elected as the President of that Board on a citywide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.227" offset="14812891">In addition to that, since the trial of this case in the District Court, in November 1974 a man by the name of Edwin L. J. Lombard, a Black, was elected on a citywide basis to the Clerk of the Criminal District Court and he defeated a White incumbent of that office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.240" offset="14888960">Now, I do not know what better evidence we -- we can bring before any court to show that Blacks in the City of New Orleans can be elected to office on a citywide basis. Of course, it requires that the Black community nominate and bring forward responsible human beings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.045" offset="14960118">When responsible human beings are -- are brought forward, it appears that the City of New Orleans and the electorate of the City of New Orleans will, in fact, elect them to office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.468" offset="14993868">So, we must take a issue and great issue with the statements of the lower court that Blacks cannot be elected in the City of New Orleans when running at large in the City of New Orleans and we do not concede that a Black cannot be elected to the at large seats in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3818.948" offset="15275781">This Court -- this case should be decided on the facts as they existed in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.191" offset="15296679">My second point, and I -- we were looking at maps earlier and I would like to call the Court’s attention to the map which appears at page 625 and I represent to the Court, this is the proposal that was made by the National Association of colored people for the City of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.972" offset="15375882">Now, we must agree that they have been a responsible Black organization and this is their proposal for the redistricting of the City of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3854.187" offset="15416738">You will note that the redistricting lines run north and south.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.299" offset="15433143">You will note that section -- district A and district B are practically the same as that in plan II.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.538" offset="15462087">You will note that the most significant difference is that the Algiers section across the river is connected with section D rather than section C.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.942" offset="15499703">The plan submitted puts Algiers with district C.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.642" offset="15514540">We submit that this is a reasonable plan -- that plan II follows the thinking of the Black community at the time that this plan was adapted and we further submit that we take issue with the east-west idea of redistricting which runs throughout the briefs of the government and also of the interveners.</text>
