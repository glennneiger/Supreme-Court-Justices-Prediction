            <text syncTime="56.458" offset="330250">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.130" offset="348954">The petitioners before this Court are the Internal Security Committee of the Senate, his Chairman Senator Eastland and several Senators along with the General Counsel of the Subcommittee, Mr. Sourwine.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.171" offset="425127">There are three additional cases involved in this petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.145" offset="448951">These petitioners are the Internal Security Committee of the House of Representative, several individual Congressmen members of that committee, the General Counsel and the investigator of that committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.646" offset="511018">I would like to call to the Court's attention that just recently the House of Representatives has voted to transfer the functions of the Internal Security Committee of the House of Representative to another committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.186" offset="577160">However, I do not believe that it creates a question of mootness in the case here where the one reason if for no other as I read the complaints in those three cases as not only asking damages specifically against the general counsel and investigator of that committee but also requesting damages against the individual congressmen members.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.907" offset="684053">In any event, the main case, the United States Servicemen's Fund versus Eastland does not have that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.274" offset="729506">The question, the basic question at issue here is at another chapter and one that this Court has faced on several occasions as to the power of a coordinate branch of our government.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.752" offset="1227400">Now, the relief requested in the complaint is that the Chemical Bank to whom the subpoena was addressed and the Senators and the staff be enjoined from seeking to enforce the subpoena and also to have the subpoena declared null and void.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.427" offset="1330113">The records sought were -- according to the evidence adduced at the preliminary hearing before the District Court and the record is quite sparse on that apparently dealt with the normal bank records, cancelled or copies of cancelled check, bank statements, although the record is very, very weak on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.038" offset="1436588">Also, there is no showing as to the number or amount of the record that were in fact in the hands and the custody of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.439" offset="1486117">It is however clear -- it is however clear and I think this is a very important part of this case that the plaintiffs below and respondents here were seeking records belonging to the bank, the recipient of the subpoena and were not seeking to enjoin the production of records which in fact belong to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.760" offset="1603459">The respondent here is a non-profit corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="490.227" offset="2065304">There are three subpoenas that were served in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.159" offset="2077006">The first was withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.623" offset="2082858">I believe that allegation refers to that subpoena, that subpoena was withdrawn.</text>

            <text syncTime="500.164" offset="2105010">We are just concern with the third subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.957" offset="2116190">The second subpoena was served but the time to comply was so short that at the request of the Servicemen's fund, the committee withdrew the second subpoena and then the third subpoena issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.852" offset="2171779">And as I say, as I read the complaint, as I read the complaint, the only allegation is that defendants caused the subpoena to be issued and that sir is the third subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.428" offset="2242100">The Court of Appeals ruled that there was no immunity attaching to the conduct of the petitioners in this cause under the speech and debate clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.505" offset="2322453">I think that the decisions of this Court clearly demonstrate that there is in fact Senatorial immunity with respect to the authorization of this investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.656" offset="2383057">With respect to the issuance of the subpoena and in fact I would go one step further even though the fact is not in the record and say with respect to the service of the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.457" offset="2442198">This Court in Gravel and in Doe versus McMillan has given a careful and thoughtful consideration to the requirements of the coordinate branch of government, namely the Congress of the United States to participate in their legislative proceeding without fear -- without fear of either intimidation by the executive or being called before as the case would say a potentially hostile judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.935" offset="2584095">And they have gone further.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.572" offset="2590678">The cases have gone further and say -- and in addition to that, members of Congress should not be burdened with the difficulty of defending suits which are brought against them for acts performed in the legislatives sphere.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.080" offset="2668732">Thus, we already have the fact that voting, committee reports, authorizing committee investigations and receiving materials pursuant thereto, introducing material at committee hearing, referring the committee reports to the speaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.777" offset="2755459">Distributing and using reports for legislative purposes are all within the legislative sphere and immune from any kind of action under the speech and debate clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.893" offset="2811988">Furthermore, if we prescient from Doe versus McMillan and the Gravel case, and go back to the case of Dombrowski versus Eastland and examine what was held there in the Court of Appeals and in fact in the Supreme Court of the United States and we will find that the allegation in that case was that the defendants tortuously conspired to subpoena records in an illegal manner from a Louisiana and American activity committee who had records belonging to the plaintiffs in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.959" offset="2972275">The Court of Appeals gladly held that the action pursuant to that subpoena insofar as the Senator and the General Counsel of the Committee were concerned were absolutely and totally immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.420" offset="3042074">The Court of Appeals affirmed -- I mean the Supreme Court affirmed that part of the decision which dealt with the Senator pointing out that there was no evidence in the record to connect him with any of the activities with the exception of the authorization of the subpoena and authorizing its service.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.475" offset="3134339">That case is a flat holding that the conduct here is not subject to review but is totally immune under the speech and debate clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.998" offset="3196406">The other factor which can be drawn from decisions of this Court, the Doe case and Gravel is that even unconstitutional conduct by members of the Congress and reading those cases, their aide, if within the legislative sphere are not subject to review by this Court or any other form, that is the holding of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.381" offset="3321898">Furthermore, presenting from the speech or debate clause and going to the basis of the coordinate branch of government theory namely separation of powers, the doctrine which was discussed in the Doe case along with the speech and debate clause and within the Gravel case points out that the judiciary where there is an immunity such as it exist under the facts of this case may not interfere with the action of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.203" offset="3453241">On this, I should emphasize as this Court did in McGrain versus Daugherty that the absolute necessity for an informed Congress is the ability to subpoena individuals and subpoena documents and that any inhibition on that power is in fact an inhibition on the ability to legislate wisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.474" offset="3582286">The Court of Appeals pointed out that the document subpoenaed in this case were bank records and that the evidence that was adduced before the District Court, District Court Judge Gasch demonstrated that the -- what the really real concern of the respondents here were in fact loss of contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.132" offset="3688970">Thus we had testimony by professional fundraisers and by representatives of this organization, that there were anonymous contribution, there were contributions by cashier's check from brokerage accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.483" offset="3754277">There were contributions from corporations that were “fronts” from individuals and in fact there was one example and I don't know whether it was hypothetical or not where the individual testified that the real anonymity was achieved where you had lunch with the donor and took cash at the lunch table.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.374" offset="3845914">These were the types of anonymous contributions which the respondents apparently felt would be disclosed should the bank records be made public.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.410" offset="3894084">Although I hasten to add the record does not show what the bank records in fact contained with respect to the names of contributors or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.397" offset="3933999">This brings us to a very interesting part of this case because here we have an attempt to equate the raising of funds, the contributing of money by a non-profit, tax exempt by a ruling organization and as distinguished from any showing that the membership of that organization is connected with or tied to contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.901" offset="4051968">Now, the argument has been made and I must emphasize to the Court in the brief filed by respondents, they say that page 41, 42 or 43 that the speech or debate clause was not mentioned by the government who represented the respondents before the Court of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.580" offset="4138695">And I think if you will look at the brief that was filed on behalf of these respondents in the Court of Appeals, there is a long and extensive section on the speech and debate clause citing Dombrowski, Doe v. McMillan and all of the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.125" offset="4192925">I would not want the Court to think that this issue was one just raised before this Court because it had been raised in the trial court and in fact before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.635" offset="4230959">But we are now in a position where what the respondents are arguing and have argued is that bank records which show potentially the source of contributors if they not be in cash is something which is covered by the First Amendment, freedom of association and I submit to the court that nowhere has this Court or to my knowledge any other court gone so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.460" offset="4362198">If in fact records of a bank which deal with moneys received by an organization, whether it be the United States Servicemen's Fund or perhaps the Republican or the Democratic Party.</text>

            <text syncTime="1642.235" offset="6673304">The subpoenas in each of these cases were in fact served and the record is very clear that they were in fact served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.011" offset="6700471">The problem as to the banks is jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.335" offset="6717712">The whole series of these actions were begone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.438" offset="6726175">The first one was -- is not now before the court, it was an action in the southern district of New York called Liberation News Service which held that New York was the improper venue for bringing an action to get a determination of the validity of such as subpoenas we have involved in this cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.496" offset="6794407">Therefore, the matter how to come down to the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.588" offset="6806737">In the prime case here, U.S. Servicemen's Fund, the fund is the New York City bank, Chemical Bank, New York Trust Company which is not present in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.394" offset="6845921">Because of the exigencies of time that is that the subpoena was served and was returnable so quickly are and the fact that part of the information was in fact delivered by a bank before the depositor had notice of the service of the subpoena, a quick action had to be brought and so an action was immediately brought in the district without even attempting to get jurisdiction in the District of Columbia over the New York bank, was brought on quickly before the trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.493" offset="6970368">A temporary stay was denied and an emergency stay was granted by the Court of Appeals, an issue was joined in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.252" offset="7005372">Because the -- in one of the, in two rather, in two of the three house cases, the bank is a District of Columbia bank so there is jurisdiction over the -- over those banks in those cases but that's not so in the prime case, U.S. Servicemen's Fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.805" offset="7063573">Chemical Bank New York Trust Company is not before the court because it was never properly served.</text>

            <text syncTime="1880.167" offset="7625101">What I think happened here is when Judge Tuttle ordered a remand, what he said was, I'm going to put this congressional people back so that there can be a hearing in the district to fashion whatever relief maybe appropriate depending upon what can be developed as to the procedures and responsibilities of the various staff members of the committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.296" offset="7705558">And he said, the District Court should be generous in adding whatever parties maybe necessary in order to give relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.009" offset="7736383">And those are staff people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.664" offset="7743070">And I think complete relief could be granted once we know the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.787" offset="7763550">If the court please, with the permission of the court, our arrangement had been that Miss Stearns was going to deal with speech or debate and I was going to deal with First Amendment and the other issues that I see -- in response to Your Honors questions will be getting into her territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.531" offset="7826557">So, if may, I would like to reserve for her responses in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.402" offset="7858009">And, but of course, the First Amendment issue is basic to the whole thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.348" offset="7877757">If you buy Mr. Miler's argument that bank records of a membership organization are not protected by the Alabama and Louisiana and Florida and so on cases and particularly the Arkansas case, Pollard against Roberts, well then we are finished, we'll never reached speech or debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.429" offset="7962081">And it seems to us that in contemporary society where it is impossible to function without using the facilities of a bank to clear your funds, whether they are cash funds taken with a luncheon table as Mr. Miller suggest or the cashier's checks, brokerage checks, the direct checks from individuals who are identifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.102" offset="8044837">The fact to the matter is that these checks are microfilmed and its these very microfilms which were requested in the very broad subpoena which was served in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.202" offset="8093215">Those bank records in effect are the membership list and in Pollard against Roberts which this Court affirmed, the three-judge court, I'm basing on what Mr. Justice Blackmun said, it was exactly the case, it was a Republican party of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.881" offset="8151939">And an attempt was made to subpoena the bank records and at the suit of an officer of the Republican party intervening as the real party at interest just as U.S. Servicemen's Fund here comes in as the real party in interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2593.977" offset="10480285">This case is actually part of a long line of cases which begins with Marbury versus Madison, moves on to Powell versus McCormack and only this past summer includes United States versus Nixon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.002" offset="10524379">In the most recent of those cases, the Chief Justice speaking for the court reaffirmed that it's emphatically the province and the duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.</text>

            <text syncTime="2617.104" offset="10572863">We have a subcommittee of the Senate of the United States seeking to evade judicial scrutiny for its acts just as the Congress of the -- the House of Representatives in the United States had in Powell and the President of the United States had in United States versus Nixon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.934" offset="10636184">At issue here is a double attempt to evade judicial scrutiny.</text>

            <text syncTime="2713.763" offset="10959475">Well, we of course argued that there would have been that power but there were two problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.065" offset="10976611">Number one, the subpoena was not initially served on the real party it interest, the party whose rights were at stake and that was one of the forms of an attempt to evade judicial scrutiny rather the subpoena was served on the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.166" offset="11025095">A stake holder who could not be expected to brave the whole question of contempt and raise the constitutional rights of its depositors, that was the first problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.988" offset="11060308">The second problem of course is amongst the various defenses the committee is raising is the question of the speech and debate clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.573" offset="11090714">If they were correct, then the court couldn't narrow because the court couldn't look at the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.661" offset="11111090">We of course argue that the speech or debate clause does not in any way prevent a federal court from looking at a congressional committee, scrutinizing it and considering and determining whether or not its constitutional but both of those attempts were made by the subcommittee to evade judicial scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.123" offset="11184859">The two reasons that we feel that the speech or debate clause is not appropriate and in fact cannot prohibit the kind of judicial scrutiny that we request and feel is appropriate, first is because the speech and debate clause is inapplicable to actions for declaratory injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.430" offset="11258107">Secondly, because the very subject matter at issue are congressional committee subpoena is not the kind of subject matter that is barred from judicial review by that clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2817.980" offset="11376285">In the opinion of this Court written by Mr. Justice White in the Gravel case, one looks very closely and sees that although damages are prohibited against a House of Representative member or a Senator that the actual actions are not necessarily barred from scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.613" offset="11458832">Therefore for example, although the writ issued -- excuse me, the authorizing resolution in Kilbourn versus Thompson could not lead to a damage action against the House of Representative's members that voted for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.437" offset="11510136">The writ itself could in fact be scrutinized.</text>

            <text syncTime="2971.108" offset="11988804">Why, I think its part of the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.905" offset="11996014">Another part of the answer however is that in reality we're not talking about every congressional committee subpoena, First Amendment or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.364" offset="12025898">What we're talking about is a very, very narrow range of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.506" offset="12042407">Those range -- those cases with the party who's constitutional issues are at stake cannot himself raise them because the subpoena has been served on the third party.</text>

            <text syncTime="3044.030" offset="12280539">Here however, we did not receive the subpoena and I think that that's probably brings us to the most basic issue in this case for we would argue that this is not really not a speech and debate clause case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.552" offset="12330590">For in fact the constitutionality of subpoenas is scrutinized by the courts all the time in these criminal contempt situations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3103.508" offset="12518463">What we would suggest Your Honor is that the situation isn't quite that different at all and that in fact implicit in the subpoena is the obvious possibility that what will follow is the executive branch and the judicial branch becoming involved and using the full weight of the government against the party upon whom the subpoena has been served.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.475" offset="12614280">But here is the one example where you can't expect the subpoenaed party to raise all this constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.903" offset="12639984">Because the subpoenaed party is an uninterested, disinterested third party here, a bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.754" offset="12663390">And therefore, in this one very, very narrow range of cases, you must in fact weighing all this matters and particularly weighing the fact that there's a First Amendment right involved permit that party whose constitutional rights are at stake to come in and have the constitutionality of the subpoena scrutinized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.264" offset="12741444">We are not and I repeat asking for any damages against the committee members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.648" offset="12762969">We are not asking for any prosecution of the committee members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.681" offset="12779165">In fact, as Judge Tuttle pointed out below, even an injunction is not necessary, similarly in Powell versus McCormick, this Court concluded that an injunction was not necessary because certainly a coordinate branch of the government would obey, would honor the ruling of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.864" offset="12851890">So, all we're really asking for here is the court to look at this subpoena, its no different, we would suggest than the writ under which Mr. Kilbourn was arrested, it is effectively, exactly the same thing to look at that writ, to look at that subpoena and determine whether or not its constitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="3482.409" offset="14033983">In the joint appendix in the Court of Appeals case, I found the complaints with the three House of Representative cases and I think if the court will examine those, they will find the damages were in fact requested $500,000.00 against the defendant's pot and the Sanders as well as the bank and additional, in paragraph 28th -- sir?</text>
