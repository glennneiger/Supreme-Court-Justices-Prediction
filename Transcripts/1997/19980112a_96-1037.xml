            <text syncTime="11.350" offset="187729">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.673" offset="200999">Oklahoma State courts have entered a money judgment against the Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.939" offset="230047">They have entered that judgment notwithstanding the fact that neither the tribe nor Congress have weighed the tribe's inherent immunity to suit, and despite the fact that in the very note sued upon, the parties agreed that nothing in that note would subject or limit the sovereign rights of the Kiowa Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.313" offset="323565">This is one of a series of judgments that has been entered against the Kiowa Tribe that arises out of the same transaction, same series of transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.493" offset="368287">The enforcement of these judgments has resulted in a seizure of the tribal tax revenues, an enjoining of the tribe from enforcing tribal law on tribal land, a garnishment of the tribal bank accounts, even accounts containing federally appropriated funds, and generally a draining of the tribal treasury to the point of crippling the tribe's ability to maintain its governmental functions.</text>

            <label>Mr. R. Brown Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="91.665" offset="509035">They are involved in the case, in this case to the extent that they show the true impact of the judgment and some of the policy reasons why Congress has not elected to waive the sovereign immunity of tribes.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="108.374" offset="575804">It is quite possible, it seems to me, that a State court might have jurisdiction to enter a judgment but perhaps not have the jurisdiction to do some of the things which you describe as having happened in this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="r_brown_wallace" startTime="121.204" stopTime="158.770">
            <label>Mr. R. Brown Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="121.204" offset="627108">I think you would have to look more deeply at what kind of judgment, and whether or not there was in fact a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.541" offset="664516">Now, if we assume that there was no waiver, I would take the position that the judgment could be at best declaratory, and relating to the application of tribal... the application of State, regulatory, or taxation laws to the tribe when it's operating certainly without tribal country, and in some cases I think the State taxation laws should be respected by the tribe within Indian country.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="158.770" offset="777364">Well, suppose there had been a waiver, would you think that these actions could then have been undertaken?</text>
            <text syncTime="164.514" offset="800352">I mean, when the Federal Government waives its sovereign immunity I don't think that means that whoever gets the judgment can move in and cart off money from the Federal Treasury.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="r_brown_wallace" startTime="175.751" stopTime="207.481">
            <label>Mr. R. Brown Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="175.751" offset="845283">Well, that's true, Your Honor, and it depends very much on how the waiver is structured.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.417" offset="872032">Typically, when tribes engage in the activity of waiving their immunity they not only select a court that they're going to go into, designate the kind of causes of action that they will be subject to, but they also regulate the extent to which they expose their assets to court process.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="207.481" offset="972238">But suppose they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.412" offset="976000">I mean, I would be just as concerned about the effects that you're concerned about here in that situation where there was a waiver, without saying anything about what you can do to the tribe to enforce the liability.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="r_brown_wallace" startTime="223.793" stopTime="260.937">
            <label>Mr. R. Brown Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="223.793" offset="1037544">Well, in representing a tribe in that situation I would certainly take the position that until there is a waiver with respect to what assets can be subjected to the judgment, then the waiver is incomplete, that in order to have a complete and effective waiver so that a judgment can be entered and can be enforced, the waiver has got to have the court agreeing that it... excuse me, have the tribe agreeing that it will be subject to court process, and then the enforcement must also be specifically covered.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="260.937" offset="1186024">So that if the tribe said, the tribe hereby waives sovereign immunity for liability on this note, that would be insufficient to waive immunity if a court ordered execution or attachment of a tribal bank account.</text>

          <turn speaker="r_brown_wallace" startTime="281.960" stopTime="318.006">

            <text syncTime="283.312" offset="1275572">I think it's insufficient because it fails to designate the property, the sovereign property to which the waiver attaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.387" offset="1307859">The... you know, the immunity of a sovereign has two basic concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.982" offset="1334295">Number 1, the agreement of the sovereign to subject itself to court jurisdiction, in essence the agreement to create jurisdiction in a court, and then the second concept is the enforcement, the designation of exactly what remedial devices that the sovereign will be subject to.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.006" offset="1414334">I just don't know if it's the tradition in our law to parse and separate sovereign immunity into those two components or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="885.524" offset="3684375">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="900.423" offset="3744039">I think the problem here is a State court did... entered a judgment which did two things, it held that as a matter of State law the tribe was not immune from suit, and that's wrong for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.995" offset="3802344">First of all, it's not a question of State law, it's a question of Federal law, and second, Federal law, Federal substantive law preserves the tribe's immunity from suit, and let me just address those for moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.072" offset="3846648">The... I think it should be common ground that this is a matter of Federal law, supervening Federal law, so if we move to the substance of the Federal law, the rule derives from... as my colleague said, it originally derives from the preconstitutional sovereign status of the tribes, and this Court has made that clear repeatedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.635" offset="3920836">Now, it is also supported in the modern context by at least three very firm foundations.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.827" offset="3941629">First, the powerful general background principle of what sovereign immunity from suit means, second, the history of the Federal Government's relationship with the tribes, Government to Government, and this Court's precedents, and third, the critical practical importance of immunity from suit from money judgments to the tribes in modern-day America.</text>

            <text syncTime="972.813" offset="4033580">With increasing commercial activity between tribes and nontribal members off the reservation there may be, indeed, a need for some waiver of sovereign immunity to make it possible for tribes to have... enter into business dealings with people off the reservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1007.764" offset="4173387">Hearings, extensive hearings were held in 1996.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.096" offset="4182687">There was a bill which passed the Senate which would have waived immunity in certain circumstances in '97.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.893" offset="4213929">That provision was removed on the premise, publicly stated, that hearings would be held by April 30th of 1998, and those hearings have been tentatively scheduled by the Committee on Indian Affairs of the Senate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1548.367" offset="6335804">As to foreign nations, it does not exist in the commercial context because Congress has passed a statute that addresses that, and may I just revert to the prior argument of my colleague by pointing out that in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act Congress was able to consider the problem holistically and to address issues like forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.096" offset="6398707">There's automatic removal for a foreign sovereign to Federal court, like enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.898" offset="6417933">There are provisions about what property of the sovereign you can attach for a judgment, and issues like damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.961" offset="6442174">There are limitations on the kind of damages that apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.144" offset="6450951">Now, as to States, first of all there's a bit of a canard going around that State sovereignty doesn't exist any more, but that's only as the States have waived it, and in Nevada v. Hall the Court recognized that some of those waivers are very limited, and those apply to the court... the State's own courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.645" offset="6516884">Now, as to Nevada v. Hall itself, that rests on a premise that the States were independent sovereigns when they went into the compact of the Constitution, and the Court found nothing in the Constitution that purported to give away each State's right to subject another sister State to its own jurisdiction, but what the States did give away was their ability to regulate Indian affairs and their ability to regulate Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.351" offset="6607686">That became a matter of exclusive Federal jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3025.754" offset="12245329">We believe that this is a case of first impression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.977" offset="12258285">However, Mescalero once again stands for the proposition that the State... I'm sorry, the Federal Government does not have exclusive jurisdiction over the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.615" offset="12320770">There are a number of cases arising in tribal taxing situations, mostly, to the effect that the States do have authority over certain aspects of activities on tribal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.935" offset="12382106">The Potawatomi case separated the regulatory from the adjudicatory authority, and it wasn't the first case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.072" offset="12426618">I think Colville perhaps did the same thing, and in Colville the Court said that the State of Washington could seize cigarettes before they ever got to the reservation, and thereby satisfy its claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.603" offset="12496731">United States v. Strate was a case which I believe remarried the adjudicatory and regulatory authority of a State on certain activities on tribal lands, but it's really not to the point that we're talking about today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.987" offset="12574262">Our point is that we have one rule for Potawatomi, for on-reservation activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.380" offset="12603833">Off-reservation activity is a whole different matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="3132.974" offset="12674259">Does it make sense, then, to say the State was wrong in going on State law and then permit this thing to be argued more fully where all these implications are explored?</text>

            <text syncTime="3183.527" offset="12876447">Well, isn't it correct to say that it's both a Federal law question and a State law question, because if there is a Federal law that says the tribe's immune here, that would obviously control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.093" offset="12910720">If there's no Federal law, a State still could, as a matter of comity, recognize the immunity of the tribe, just as in Nevada v. Hall it could have been decided the other way as a matter of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.261" offset="12959412">So you've got... it seems to me inevitably you have both a Federal issue and a State law issue, and the State law issue has been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.214" offset="12983236">They're not going to show comity here, and they've assumed the answer to the Federal question, and... which we have to really resolve.</text>

            <text syncTime="3217.310" offset="13011552">I would agree that... I think the principal issues are Federal law principles, but once you find that a State has certain rights, then you do get into the State law aspect of the question, and this Court has dealt with that in a number of cases on-reservation, arising out of State regulatory actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.144" offset="13106951">The... I think that Puyallup was mentioned a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.141" offset="13146867">Puyallup had to do with fishing rights onreservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.555" offset="13172571">To that degree, we feel that it's not controlling in our situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.621" offset="13200783">This situation relates to the activities of the tribe when it goes beyond its boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.575" offset="13236623">Nevada, in reciting some of the rule says, Number 1, a sovereign cannot be sued in its own courts without its consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.553" offset="13280509">That is the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.973" offset="13286256">Whatever rights the visiting sovereign, the sovereign that comes into the property, into the jurisdiction of the first sovereign, the host sovereign has, are there merely as a matter of comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.754" offset="13341322">They're not accorded any rights as a matter of their own independent sovereignty, because they're now in some other sovereign's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.759" offset="13381342">What the tribe seeks, what the United States wants to give them in this case is a sovereignty which says that when the tribe goes into another court's jurisdiction... the State of Oklahoma, the State of Hawaii, the State of whatever, that at that point the tribe's sovereignty supersedes that of the jurisdiction of the State of Oklahoma, and the State of Oklahoma has no ability to sue it or to control that activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3347.015" offset="13530344">I thought the United States was taking the position that it's the peculiar relationship of trust between the United States and the tribes that gives them this kind of unusual dependent sovereignty, not really the kind of sovereign... sovereignty that a sister State or a foreign nation would have, but a dependent, depending on the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3372.122" offset="13630863">That is correct, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.403" offset="13639954">The basis for Indian law, Indian sovereignty, certainly has to do with the relationship between the tribe and the U.S. Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.430" offset="13680078">In this case, however, in our opinion the U.S. tries to go outside of Federal common law and other law as we know it and give the tribe immunity when it takes whatever acts in a commercial vein in this situation outside its own reservation, outside the area where it has territorial sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.227" offset="13791255">Sovereign immunity always has a territorial aspect, and that's what we ask in this case, is that territorial aspect be respected and accorded the appropriate proper weight.</text>
