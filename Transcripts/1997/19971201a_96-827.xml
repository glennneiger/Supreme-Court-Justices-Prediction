            <text syncTime="14.001" offset="210526">In Harlow v. Fitzgerald, a First Amendment retaliation case, the Court held that district courts should protect defendants' qualified immunity through firm application of the civil rules protecting defendants against the burden of broad-ranging discovery and enabling them promptly to seek and in substantial cases promptly to obtain summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.968" offset="314493">The Federal rules are fully sufficient to accomplish these purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.081" offset="330898">At the outset of litigation district courts can hold the plaintiff's discovery in abeyance and allow defendants to inquire of the plaintiffs, obtaining from the plaintiffs all evidence that they have to support their contentions that they exercised First Amendment rights, that the defendants knew about it, that the defendants injured the plaintiffs, and that the motive for the injury was retaliation for exercise--</text>

            <text syncTime="108.103" offset="587003">No, that's the question, but the two burdens identified in Harlow are, first, the burdens of trial and the burdens of broad-ranging discovery, and what I'm suggesting is that at the outset of the case the district court through firm application of the rules, as the Court said should be done in Harlow, can protect defendants against broad-ranging discovery and, indeed, impose the burden on the plaintiff to come forward immediately with all evidence to support the claim, all elements of the claim, and if the plaintiff is unable to do so immediately, the defendant is entitled to summary judgment unless, of course, the plaintiff can show specific facts giving rise to a reasonable likelihood that discovery will uncover necessary evidence.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="143.527" offset="728691">Mr. Schember, speaking more generally there's talk of discovery abuses not just in this case but throughout the country, and the answer often is, well, the district judges have it within their power to prevent that, and I think a lot of people agree that's true, but you have 700 district judges in the country and they just react differently to this sort of problem.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Schember</label>
            <text syncTime="164.862" offset="814059">Yes, and I think guidance from this Court could tell them how to firmly apply the civil rules, and the purpose of my argument is to suggest precisely what should be said in that regard, and that by holding the plaintiff's discovery in abeyance at the outset of the case until the defendant has been entitled to discover all the plaintiff's evidence, thereby placing the defendant in the position of promptly seeking summary judgment unless the plaintiff has sufficient evidence or has a basis for seeking discovery, that is firm control that prohibits excessive burden on the defendant at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.336" offset="951881">And even if the plaintiffs make a showing that there's a reasonable likelihood that discovery will uncover evidence supporting their claims the district court still could hold their discovery in abeyance if the defendant wished to assert a defense under Mount Healthy Board of Education v. Doyle, saying even if I... we were substantially motivated by hostility to the plaintiff's exercise of constitutional rights, nonetheless we would have taken the same action in any event, and if defendants come forward with sufficient evidence to establish that defense, they are entitled immediately to summary judgment on that ground unless, of course, plaintiff immediately can present admissible evidence rebutting that, or, again, make a showing that there are facts giving rise to a reasonable likelihood that discovery--</text>

            <text syncTime="248.758" offset="1149576">When you're talking about intent, though, that's a very difficult issue to get summary judgment on, because it's the subjective state of someone's mind, and it's just something that ordinarily it goes to a trier of fact, I think.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.644" offset="1241109">However, inquiry as to the specific intent of unconstitutional animus I would suggest is narrower.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.227" offset="1263470">For example, the plaintiff certainly has to show I exercised First Amendment rights and the defendant knew about it, and discovery as to that inquiry certainly is narrower than whether the defendant's a bad person, a malicious person, someone who customarily is mean to people, that type of thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1789.233" offset="7311548">First, that in wrongful intent cases such as this there needs to be some kind of heightened standard applied to protect public officials with regard to determining whether they had a wrongful intent or not, because if you don't have some kind of special heightened standard the result is going to be, in nearly all of these cases, we're going to put public officials through discovery, past summary judgment, and into trial, and that will cause all of the harm to effective government and all of the harm to the public interest that this Court in Harlow designed a rule to prohibit, and I think he's quite wrong to say that we can simply rely on the normal rules to take care of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2608.915" offset="10590229">First of all, thousands of cases puts quite a burden on the district courts, but the more important point, I think, is that the policy consideration that drove Harlow was that if you permit cases like this to proceed, you will dampen the ardor of public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.797" offset="10657729">Unless public officials are certain that these insubstantial suits are going to be promptly dismissed before discovery and trial, the risk is great, the Harlow court said, that these public officials are not going to be unflinching in their duties, and at a given prison, it would only take one such claim to do that kind of harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.350" offset="10735992">Just let one of these cases linger and occupy the time of a public official, challenging what I still want to call their good faith, just one of them can dampen their ardor with regard to other situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.087" offset="10786879">They will be afraid to take action that might engender another lawsuit, and we would submit that is the core of Harlow, and it is why some kind of special rule needs to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.346" offset="10835989">I haven't talked yet about clear and convincing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.426" offset="10844244">Obviously, you have to first be persuaded that some kind of heightened standard is needed in order to address the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.271" offset="10871620">I would like just to take the last few moments, with the Court's permission, to tick off what I think are four reasons why clear and convincing is the right kind of heightened standard to use in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.029" offset="10918640">First of all, and this will be abbreviated, as Judge Williams said in his opinion, this is a situation where we had asymmetry in the risk of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.556" offset="10956779">That is to say, the Court has already determined in Harlow itself that some meritorious cases must be turned away in order to serve the greater good of ensuring that insubstantial cases will be promptly dismissed, and it's in an asymmetry of error situation the Court has often adopted clear and convincing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.059" offset="11030758">His second reason was that this is a case where, just to use his words, motive is easy to allege and hard to disprove.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.965" offset="11066389">That, too, suggests that we need a benefit of the doubt for public officials, and that's a point the Court made in Harlow itself, where it said at page 814, note 23, dishonest or vindictive motives are readily attributed and as readily believed, actually raising the specter that we may have public officials who are completely innocent of the charge but would be found guilty because of the tenuousness of the kind of evidence we're dealing with.</text>

            <text syncTime="3364.602" offset="13613014">We're also concerned about those cases in which there's extensive discovery where a motion for summary judgment is ultimately granted after the plaintiff has conducted deposition after deposition and the court concludes that in fact there is not sufficient factual evidence to support the claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="3391.269" offset="13719698">Well, we think that in fact Justice Ginsburg in the court of appeals has suggested an appropriate approach with regard to discovery, and as a separate matter he has suggested that discovery should not go forward unless it's likely to produce sufficient evidence to achieve the desired result at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.633" offset="13789080">In other words, the plaintiff has to produce some evidence of an improper motive and, in addition, must show that there's a reasonable likelihood that he can produce evidence through discovery that will--</text>

            <text syncTime="3431.707" offset="13881448">There's always a question of the burdens and benefits of discovery, and the benefits of discovery is the likelihood of the evidence being produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.312" offset="13907780">The plaintiff is obligated when he submits his Rule 56(f) affidavit to indicate what his basis for believing is that this discovery will be fruitful, so in fact the district judge will have a basis to make that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.148" offset="13959189">He will be able to look at what the plaintiff is suggesting he will obtain on discovery, and he can make a reasoned judgment of whether or not he's likely to obtain the evidence he thinks he will receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.326" offset="13991894">In a case such as this, I think it's quite clear that the intended deposition of Ms. Britton is unlikely to produce anything more than what her deposition states, namely that she did this for a proper purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="3480.498" offset="14076531">If you look to what the fourth amended complaint actually states in this case on page 185 of the petition, it indicates that the plaintiff himself indicates that Ms. Britton was acting in order to protect the prisoner's property.</text>

            <text syncTime="3503.345" offset="14167960">Ultimately, that takes me back to my point with regard to restrictions on discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.275" offset="14183633">We do think that it's appropriate not only to have a clear and convincing standard here, but also to require that there be limitations on discovery to ensure that that discovery is limited and narrowed to that... to those areas that are in fact of vital importance in proving the plaintiff's case.</text>
