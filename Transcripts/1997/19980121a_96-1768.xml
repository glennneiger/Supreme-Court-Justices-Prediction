            <text syncTime="13.121" offset="199398">In this case, a district judge determined that Mr. Feltner should pay Columbia Pictures 8.8 million in statutory damages for a copyright infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.006" offset="238895">Before arriving at that figure, the judge held a bench trial, after which he made the factual finding that Mr. Feltner's conduct was willful, which increased the amount of damages which could be awarded under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.799" offset="286124">In light of clear historical practice on both sides of the Atlantic prior to 1971, Feltner had a right under the Seventh Amendment to have a jury make that finding and others on which the award was based and determine the amount of damages to be imposed within the statutory limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.214" offset="347773">Before reaching that constitutional question, however, we need to consider whether the statute may be construed to afford a jury trial right.</text>

            <text syncTime="78.830" offset="462190">Statutory damages as to the court shall appear to be just, the samel terminology as employed in the 1856 act, were carried forward in successive acts up to the 1909 act, when the statutory damages provision took its modern form, with no indication that Congress wanted to delete the jury trial right that was so clearly present in 1856.</text>

            <text syncTime="898.253" offset="3739930">--In Tull was, because Congress had fixed the amounts earlier they could delegate that to a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.845" offset="3762291">Here you had in the 18th Century fixed amounts under the Statute of Anne, under the first Federal copyright statute, but also a situation where you could get damages for copyright infringement that weren't fixed by Congress and whenever they were not fixed by Congress, those were for a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.120" offset="3819342">I don't know that that situation was replicated with respect to the civil penalty actions of the sort at issue in Tull.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.150" offset="3843480">And it's also the case here we had 18th Century preSeventh Amendment statutes providing for a range of statutory damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.788" offset="3874095">Statutes in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island provided for the recovery of statutory damages within a broad range, so therefore that basic distinction, the difference between fixed and range, doesn't make a difference with respect to characterizing the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.125" offset="3931355">The second step in this Court's constitutional analysis is to look to the nature of the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.466" offset="3952776">Here, the remedy is money damages, the hallmark of legal relief, and this Court has said that monetary damages are legal and require a jury except in two very specific, defined circumstances, when they constitute restitution or disgorgement, and when they're incidental to or intertwined with equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.850" offset="4030307">The first certainly doesn't apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.083" offset="4039189">Restitution is one of the factors that the jury can consider in setting the amount of damages, but it's not the only one.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.144" offset="4067506">They also can look at punishment and compensation, traditional legal remedies, and those legal remedies give the right to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.516" offset="4093001">Again, this is another argument that was made in Tull.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.264" offset="4103973">The Government argued there the purpose of the Clean Water Act penalties is restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.327" offset="4120168">Therefore, this is equitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.793" offset="4126020">The Court said no, the purpose is also punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.432" offset="4136573">Punishment was one of the purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.823" offset="4142216">That's a legal remedy and therefore this is a legal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.681" offset="4157576">The modern statutory damages serve the legal purposes of punishment and compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.740" offset="4181817">You can see the punishment aspect in the fact that you get a broader... a higher range for willful, a lower range for innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.988" offset="4206895">You can see the compensatory aspect in the fact that these damages are instead of actual damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.689" offset="4229674">You don't get both because they serve the same purpose, provide some recompense for the copyright holder.</text>

            <text syncTime="1064.235" offset="4403858">Second of all, the fact that that's one of the reasons you have this relief doesn't make it equitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.124" offset="4423398">Parties frequently provide liquidated damages in contracts because they think it will be difficult to prove actual damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1174.423" offset="4844596">The three State statutes I mentioned provided a range prior to the adoption of the Seventh Amendment and they said, you recover this range in an action of debt, an action at law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1211.471" offset="4992763">Where no precise rule of law fixes the reasonable damages, it is the peculiar function of the jury to determine the amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.842" offset="5022229">That was the rule at common law, Lord Townshend's Case, the jury are judges of the damages, and that is what this Court held with respect to the Seventh Amendment consistently, at least prior to Tull.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.605" offset="5061308">That's why we don't have additur or unconditional remittitur, because it's for the jury to determine the amount of damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1254.094" offset="5163290">The body of precedent with respect to civil penalties may well be different, but the Court noted in Tull, for example, that it had been presented with no evidence that the Framers were concerned that the jury trial right extend to the question of remedy, and that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.822" offset="5222222">If you go back and read the briefs, the evidence isn't there, but the evidence is there in the real world.</text>

            <text syncTime="1479.768" offset="6065977">Congress enacted statutory damages in 1909 as an alternative to actual damages to provide some recompense to copyright holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.342" offset="6116237">Congress did this because it recognized that actual, legal damages were frequently difficult, if not impossible to prove and therefore did not provide an adequate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.085" offset="6171199">Statutory damages were later amended and expanded in 1975 and in 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.878" offset="6210382">The formulation of an alternate form of relief where legal damages are inadequate is quintessentially an equitable remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.702" offset="6273703">Moreover, statutory damages require and involve the exercise of nearly unbridled discretion by the court and an appeal to the court's sense of justice based upon the particular facts in an individual case to fashion a remedy that is both just and consistent with the goals of the Copyright Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3235.360" offset="13088319">It's important to recognize that the willfulness determination here was critical to the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.608" offset="13105351">The district court noted the range for willful infringements before imposing his award.</text>

            <text syncTime="3266.831" offset="13214229">If this is a legal action, issues of infringement, number of works, willfulness have to be tried to the jury and Tull is the only impediment to the conclusion that damages also are for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.452" offset="13256652">Tull proceeds along the assumption that, although the Framers were willing to take up arms over the issue of whether a judge or a jury decides liability, they didn't care one way or another whether the judge or the jury said 200 dollars or 100,000 dollars.</text>
