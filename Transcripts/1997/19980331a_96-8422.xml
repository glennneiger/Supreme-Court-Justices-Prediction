            <text syncTime="504.631" offset="2164649">This was clearly a regional effort of those who were close to gun users and possessors who wanted to trim the tail of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.240" offset="2207177">The legislative debates, with the greatest respect, Justice O'Connor, are devoid of an indication of a concern that the firearm enthusiasts had a problem with State or local individuals, so the statute was clearly aimed at the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.793" offset="2297351">The statutory title telegraphs the intent of statute... Firearm Owners Protection Act... in the same way that the Clean Water Act telegraphs a congressional intent to take a strong line to protect the environment and to hold corporations to a higher standard of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.406" offset="2363807">The plain wording of the statute, the use of the word wilfully as opposed to the use of the term knowingly in other sections, of section 924 also sends the very same message of congressional intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1445.206" offset="5927013">In essence, what the Government has done here in its brief today is to argue the reverse of Bates v. the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.660" offset="5952822">In Bates, it was the defense that argued that this Court should somehow read something more into a statute dealing with the fraudulent use of student loan moneys.</text>

            <text syncTime="1475.786" offset="6049267">If it helps the defendant, so be it, if it hurts the defendant, so be it, that's what the Congress wrote, and accordingly we respectfully submit that the Government's approach ought not be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.534" offset="6088346">Before I sit down, reserving the balance of my time, I simply want to indicate in response to Justice Stevens' question that we rely on Francis v. Franklin as an example of the case of internally conflicting jury instructions as a basis for this Court granting relief under the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.686" offset="6160862">The Government does not argue harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.337" offset="6171520">Indeed, under Sullivan v. Louisiana we respectfully submit they could not, and we respectfully urge this Court to reverse the conviction, and remand it to the United States Court of Appeals for further proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2563.363" offset="10399595">All I want to say about that argument is that the cases that they cite don't support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.996" offset="10422164">In fact, the principal appellate authority that they cite, the Stein's, Inc. case, applies the longstanding rule that a wilful violation, a wilful behavior is action taken with the bad purpose to disobey or disregard the law, and cites appellate authority of its own circuit, which in turn cites this Court's opinion in Murdock.</text>

            <text syncTime="2949.469" offset="11944058">And our own... and what this case is really about is whether there's any requirement that we have some extraordinary standard that applies in this particular case, and for the reasons our brief said, and that I've tried to summarize, no, the extraordinary standard isn't applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.429" offset="12003931">The ordinary standard is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.769" offset="12013231">And if I can't tell you exactly what that ordinary standard is, it's because this Court has given us several different descriptions of it, and so if I were to say that only one applied, I think it would be an incomplete description, because criminal blameworthiness is maybe not something that is capable of crystalline definition.</text>
