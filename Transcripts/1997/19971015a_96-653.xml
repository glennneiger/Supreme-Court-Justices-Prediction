            <text syncTime="1141.173" offset="4716219">Set aside for the moment the question of whether under normal principles of preclusion these children who were strangers to the proceeding could be bound.</text>

            <text syncTime="1152.684" offset="4762299">But the point you make is the one that intrigues me most in a way, and that is, the whole premise of full faith and credit in a Federal union like ours is a premise of mutual respect, the premise that says a State is not to assume that the courts of another State just can't do justice as well as its courts can and, indeed, that premise pervades our system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.360" offset="4860937">The Anti-Injunction Act and the Younger doctrine means the Federal courts can't presume inadequacy on the part of the State courts, and this Court's decisions in Donovan v. Dallas and General Atomic indicate, too, that a State court cannot tell litigants, even litigants in its courts, that they may not invoke certain procedures in a Federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1207.301" offset="4980682">Essentially, if the Eighth Circuit's use of the decree from Michigan is affirmed, it will follow that the courts of a State can not only make decisions that will have res judicata and preclusive and sometimes collateral estoppel effect substantively in the courts of another State, it will follow that the courts of a State can control who can be called as a witness, who can be deposed, what evidence can be introduced in another State or in the Federal courts.</text>
