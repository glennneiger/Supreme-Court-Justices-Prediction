            <label>Mr. James Hamilton</label>
            <text syncTime="11.150" offset="192327">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.172" offset="212493">On Sunday, July 11, 1993, at 10:00 a.m. in the morning, Vince Foster came to my home to consult me as a lawyer in the Travel Office matter, which was then the matter of intense public controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.713" offset="290652">We spoke alone for 2 hours, during which time I took three pages of notes, which are the subject of this litigation here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.101" offset="332134">Before we began, Mr. Foster asked me if the conversation was privileged and, without hesitation, I said that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.329" offset="377065">It is not disputed that my notes would be privileged had Mr. Foster not taken his own life 9 days later in Fort Marcy Park, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.707" offset="426593">Mr. Chief Justice, I wish to make five major points this morning which I would like to summarize briefly at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.284" offset="464941">First, any balancing test or ruling that leaves the existence of the attorney-client privilege after death in doubt would have a significant chilling effect on client candor, particularly as to those who expect to die soon, because people do care about their reputations and the fate of family and friends after death.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.780" offset="574864">Secondly, Independent Counsel's central contention that only the perjurer would be chilled if the privilege does not survive but not the truthful client, or the client intending to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege, is contrary to reason and experience and is unsupported by any decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.897" offset="679354">Third, the conclusion that the privilege should survive in civil cases but not in criminal cases is illogical and unworkable and is supported by no case, no statute, or no commentator.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.539" offset="745914">Fourth, all the pertinent State statutes recognize and virtually all of the nontestator cases hold that the privilege survives death, and the testator cases generally recognize that they apply an exception to the general rule that is intended to effectuate the testator's intent.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="173.966" offset="843612">It's an exception that pretty much swallows up the rule though, isn't it?</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="178.368" offset="861270">I mean, like 95 percent of the cases involve the exception to the rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="241.924" offset="1115494">The other is the case in Massachusetts, the case... the case involved a John Doe, as it is styled.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="249.460" offset="1145587">Counsel, I recognize that the time frame for your briefing was compressed, but I think there may be at least a misimpression left by your footnote 22 at page 21 and it bears, too, on Judge Tatel's discussion and it bears, too, on your opening remarks that the States say the privilege does not survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.782" offset="1278916">In California, at least, and that's one of the States you cite in the footnote, the privilege does expire when the estate's closed, and that's been so for 35 years, and I have not found anything in the literature indicating that in California this has caused, number 1, any lack... any diminishment in the number of lawyers, or in their effectiveness in representing their clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.519" offset="1429799">And so I think it's a very important distinction to say that the privilege can be exercised pending the administration of the estate, and then it closes, and if the other States, or some of them, are like California, that is, it seems to me, a very significant indication that experience has shown that this is not a problem.</text>

            <label>Mr. James Hamilton</label>
            <text syncTime="386.312" offset="1693009">Justice Kennedy, in a number of States, close to 20 States, the State provisions apply, or say that the lawyer also can assert the privilege, not just the personal representative but the lawyer also and, of course, that indicates that the survival of the privilege has nothing to do with the winding up of the estate.</text>

            <text syncTime="446.131" offset="1932291">Well, in any event, in your brief and in a number of the amicus briefs it's stated that what the Independent Counsel is requesting here is very sweeping and unprecedented, but we have at least California, we have Pennsylvania, we have the ALI, which speaks for lawyers, we have all of the commentators except Wigmore, I think, and we have, as Justice Scalia points out, the privilege that in any event is inapplicable when estates and property are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.867" offset="2095190">It's inapplicable if there's an ongoing scheme that the attorney is consulted for in order to continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.853" offset="2119223">It's inapplicable as to fees, inapplicable as to clients who dispute what the attorney told them and that the clients then are in dispute and, also, the privilege that we're talking about here is one only as to compelled testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.586" offset="2198113">The attorney's ethical duty to remain silent continues.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.059" offset="2215981">And so it seems to me that this not the sweeping change that the amicus briefs and that you indicate.</text>
