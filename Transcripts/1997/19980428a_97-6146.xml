            <text syncTime="137.338" offset="698130">The question in this case is, does double jeopardy prevent the State from going in and relitigating the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="180.981" offset="872732">If, say, the jury acquits your client there's no proceeding available whereby the State could appeal and say, probably because of double jeopardy, that this was a wrong result.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.498" offset="942740">What the question really gets at in this situation is the tension I think that the Court addressed in Burks v.

            <text syncTime="218.730" offset="1023720">Well, for purposes of the distinction between an appellate court's finding and a jury verdict, the distinction that the Court was referring to in Burks, the question is, should those two be treated differently?</text>
            <text syncTime="230.057" offset="1068964">There may be other reasons why a sentence enhancement trial is not subject to double jeopardy and we're certainly going to talk about those, I--</text>

            <text syncTime="236.753" offset="1095818">--I suspect, but for purposes of the distinction between a trial acquittal and an appellate acquittal, Burk suggests that there's no rational reason why there should be a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.609" offset="1131240">In both situations the treatment should be the same, otherwise the petitioner or the appellant is arbitrarily deprived of some right simply because the trial level fact-finder made the wrong call.</text>

            <text syncTime="371.173" offset="1633418">Why do you want to punish the State for being more concerned about the prisoner's rights, and instead of letting the judge find it by a preponderance, saying, we're going to insist that it be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt?</text>

Nelson indicates that the Court evaluates the nature of the finding that was made to determine whether it's properly characterized, for example, as insufficient evidence or trial error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.101" offset="9405160">The same is true in Poland v. Arizona, which is a case in the Bullington context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.765" offset="9427834">But no, we do not dispute that the State courts have determined that there was insufficient evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.690" offset="9451554">In our view, however, that entire analysis is confined to the sufficiency context, which is concluded when this proceeding begins.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.167" offset="9489483">I would also like to describe the nature of this proceeding, because the petitioner's argument is that if it looks sufficiently like a trial on guilt or innocence, it is a trial on guilt or innocence, notwithstanding the fact that guilt has been resolved prior to the hearing in this case, and therefore and argue the Double Jeopardy Clause does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.780" offset="9571926">In California in these proceedings, the record is abbreviated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2376.036" offset="9652905">Typically, no defense is offered and none was offered here, as has been pointed out, and it is true that California has elected to provide additional procedural guarantees in these proceedings, but it is our view that because the guilt determination has been completed by the time of this event, as Justice Blackmun's majority opinion in DiFrancesco describes it, that is behind the defendant at the time of sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.611" offset="9755201">There is no process here that is comparable to the determination of guilt or innocence, and in our view that also distinguishes this case from Bullington v. Missouri, and that is to say that in Bullington, of course, the Court held that the jury's decision to sentence the defendant to life in a capital case constitutes an acquittal of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.207" offset="9845585">And Justice Souter, I would agree with your observation, or the suggestion in your question, that the inquiry in Bullington ultimately was, is there evidence of the sole issue the jury decides, namely death or life, and I submit that is a fundamentally different issue, because in this case, unlike in the capital context, the jury in the petitioner's case was not the sentencer.</text>

I don't understand analytically how one could be acquitted of a sentence and that is, of course, the petitioner's argument, that this is somehow an acquittal, as though, if he is correct, the State would be foreclosed from alleging a future recidivism action, for example, or that in the context of a death penalty case, if the sole aggravator was another criminal offense, the acquittal, or the decision of life, would constitute an acquittal of that future crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.176" offset="11029454">For these reasons, because this case fits squarely within the recidivism context, or the sentencing context, I believe that the Court's description in Caspari is significant here, and that is, the Court has observed in Caspari, which has been minimalized as a Teague v. Lane case, but in fact I think the Teague analysis is not irrelevant here when the Court in Caspari says that the determination, the prior determination of a sentence is an objectively verifiable fact, based upon readily available evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2776.215" offset="11253585">I think that that observation in Caspari was correct, as was the Court's observation in Caspari, unlike the concerns in the double jeopardy context, that when dealing with noncapital sentencing, and particularly the prior offender, there is an increased accuracy in verifying the record in the prior case.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3161.233" offset="12793660">Well, DiFrancesco talked about an expectation of finality, and pointed out that there the defendant knew that there was a proceeding where the sentence could be appealed and that there might be more hearings, but if you have a procedure in which the sentence is final, the appellate court affirms the sentence, and then there's some proceeding, new proceeding to reopen it, it seems to me that that does maybe indicate that an expectation of finality is being disappointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.516" offset="12934825">That's not this case, I don't think.</text>

            <label>Mr. Matthew D. Roberts</label>
            <text syncTime="3198.018" offset="12940886">--Correct, it's not this case, Justice Kennedy, and we would submit that the expectation of finality that's created only goes so far as the State law that creates it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.965" offset="12988638">I think it's important to recognize that the rule advanced by petitioner that trial-like hallmarks at sentencing automatically triggers a bar on resentencing places too little value on society's interest in accurate and appropriate punishment, and too great a value on defendant's interest in finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.786" offset="13055929">And it's been pointed out, it might discourage States from providing procedural protections at sentencing, because they wouldn't be free to do so without also triggering double jeopardy protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.143" offset="13101382">Finally, just to briefly address the issue that came up on the question of Almendarez-Torres.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.970" offset="13140670">In addition to the fact that it hasn't been argued here, I think it would be inappropriate... for the same reason that it would be inappropriate to have a rule that triggered double jeopardy by the procedural protections, it would be inappropriate to have a rule that said that the State has to make things an element of the offense when it decides it wants to provide certain procedural protections, because that's forcing it to trade off its interests in accurate and appropriate punishment against its decision to afford defendant certain protections to make the sentencing proceeding more fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.872" offset="13272223">In essence, the reading of Bullington that's advanced by petitioner here is as unworkable and unwise as it is unwarranted by precedent and principle, and we would ask that the Court should affirm the judgment of the California supreme court.</text>
