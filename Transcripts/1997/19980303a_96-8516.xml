            <text syncTime="11.810" offset="195289">This is an unusual case in that it may fairly be said that this defendant is in prison for acts that do not amount to a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.464" offset="233846">This Court's unanimous opinion in the Bailey case made it clear that mere possession of weapons near drugs does not amount to use under the Federal statute under which Mr. Bousley was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.342" offset="281389">It is at the core of habeas corpus jurisprudence to release prisoners who are held without legal authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.999" offset="320050">Mr. Bousley is in this position because at the time he entered his guilty plea to the charge under 924(c) the charges had been explained to him in language of possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.290" offset="381177">However, the Bailey case makes it clear that one cannot be convicted of this... violating this statute lest there's been proof of active employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="91.292" offset="513147">The difficulty here is that it's not just the colloquy but it's the entire presentation of the nature of the charges to Mr. Bousley led him to believe and, indeed, caused the reflection that this was a mere possession crime, rather than an active employment crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.085" offset="596321">As a result, his guilty plea cannot be construed as--</text>

            <text syncTime="115.826" offset="611263">Well, but then that goes to the next argument that the law has changed in your view, et cetera, but if this were pre Bailey, and Bailey had never been on the books, would you... you would still say, I take it, that the plea was inadequately counseled and that the colloquy under Rule 11 was inadequate.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.753" offset="715022">--That's correct, but again, in order for a guilty plea to be valid, it must be knowledgeable and it must be intelligent and when the crime is explained as something other than what the statute actually describes, the plea cannot be intelligent or knowing, because the defendant is not aware and because the presentation does not comply with the statute, so it's more than just a Rule 11 violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="292.331" offset="1317301">It turns out that that was incorrect, because, as the Court well knows, section 924 requires proof of active employment rather than mere possession.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.356" offset="1517399">Here, of course, it's quite clear that the explanation did not match the critical element of use as it's defined under section 92--</text>

            <text syncTime="1190.094" offset="4908406">As the Chief Justice's question suggests, if the Government takes the position it has taken on the validity of the plea agreement, it seems to me that position will have to be applied not just in a case like this where the circuits were at one time virtually uniform, but in the case of any circuit split you would have to invalidate all of the plea agreements in that half of the circuit split that ultimately loses, because the district judges in that half of the circuits will have been instructing the... in the Rule 11 colloquy according to the law of their circuit, and would not all of those plea agreements be invalid whenever it turns out that the element of the crime in question is as the other circuits have said?</text>

            <text syncTime="2070.206" offset="8428876">Mr. Dreeben, you've made out a perfectly good case for saying that we ought to look at the voluntariness of the plea in the light of the final resolution of what the elements of the crime are, but there is a case for looking at it the other way and saying there is no constitutional violation if, at least under the prevailing or the unobjected to law at the time of the plea, it was properly done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.292" offset="8529187">What's the Government's... what is your best reason for saying we ought to look at it your way rather than look at it the way that if it was okay at the time, no constitutional violation?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="2105.300" offset="8569206">Justice Souter, in most contexts it is the law at the time of the plea that should govern the analysis of the question, and that is because if you look at a case like Brady, in which this Court basically said then existing law governs the validity of the plea, the question that is being asked is, the defendant has admitted his guilt of the substantive offense and now, should we let him after the fact say, in hindsight I miscalculated about what the law might have been, if I had known what the law would be, I never would have admitted my guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.011" offset="8700027">And I think the law quite properly says, that's not the kind of claim you can raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.192" offset="8716746">You must take your chances with what the consequences of pleading guilty might be, or whether you had a good suppression motion that you forewent, but this case is different, because the requirement for the valid admission of guilt that justifies holding somebody in prison in the first place is that he had an idea of what the crime was that he was pleading guilty to, in other words, as this Court said in Henderson v. Morgan, that he had true knowledge of the charges that he was admitting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.382" offset="8829490">This defendant knew that he was admitting possession of a firearm near drugs and he was told that that made him guilty of a criminal offense and he said, I did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.097" offset="8868360">Those facts are correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.569" offset="8874316">I'm willing to take a guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.062" offset="8880272">But in fact, that's not what the law meant, as we now know from Bailey, was required to obtain a valid admission of guilt, so Justice Souter, my distinction is that the core basis for allowing a guilty plea rather than a trial to establish guilt is that the defendant acknowledges that this conduct either was or can be shown to be satisfying of the elements of the offense under a proper understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.508" offset="8986016">If he lacks that proper understanding, his admission of the crime is not a valid basis for holding him in prison, and that is distinct from all of the other considerations that he might have viewed in hindsight as impugning whether he would have made that admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.520" offset="9050068">Here, he never really made it in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="2850.891" offset="11551554">In another class of cases, of which this is supposedly one, there is no other offense, so that if he pleads guilty to this kind of... under these circumstances, he's pleading guilty to something which under no possible set of legal facts would be punishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.366" offset="11649461">Shouldn't a distinction be drawn between those two kinds of plea cases, the argument being that in the first class of cases the public has a... at least an interest in having murderers generally locked up, but there is no discernible public interest, or no serious public interest in locking up people for something which is not a crime by anyone's definition, and for conduct which does not fit within a crime by anybody's definition.</text>
