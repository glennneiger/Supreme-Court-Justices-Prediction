            <text syncTime="16.443" offset="214669">Rejecting Joseph Oncale's title VII claims, the Fifth Circuit stated, same-sex harassment claims are not cognizable under title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.918" offset="252599">The question presented through this appeal is whether the Fifth Circuit's categorical rejection of same-sex claims under title VII is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.262" offset="281961">We argue that it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.214" offset="289797">The court below should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.027" offset="297007">Same-sex sexual harassment claims are actionable under title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.118" offset="313412">This case is not about the outer limits or parameters of same-sex sexual harassment as an actionable form of discrimination because of sex, nor is this case about the methods of proof of such a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.770" offset="371926">This case is about whether a same-sex sexual harassment claim exists as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.036" offset="401079">The Fifth Circuit rule that same-sex claims do not exist under title VII is not sex-specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.569" offset="431172">It is an absolute rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.662" offset="439531">Both sides to this litigation agree that women are entitled to the protections of title VII, but to accept the Fifth Circuit rule is to accept the proposition that a woman's right to work in an environment free of unwelcome sexual conduct, or sexual solicitation, turns on the sex of her harasser.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.427" offset="530646">If the harasser is a female, the woman has no rights or remedies under title VII as interpreted by the Fifth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="105.456" offset="570666">This case does involve a man, but I emphasize that the Fifth Circuit's ruling is not a male-on-male decision, it is a same-sex decision, and I emphasize that to point out the breadth of the Fifth Circuit's categorical and absolute rule that same-gender sexual harassment claims, regardless of the genders, as long as they're identical, and regardless of the underlying facts, would, under the Fifth Circuit's rule, be dismissed as a matter of law, but Your Honor, you're exactly correct, this is a male-on-male situation, but the court did not decide the case on that fact except to recognize that the genders of the two parties, the harasser and the victim, were the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.225" offset="733774">So to accept the Fifth Circuit's rule, then, is to agree that the sex of the harasser defines the scope of title VII.</text>

            <text syncTime="176.574" offset="855192">So I don't think that the Fifth Circuit has ruled quite as broadly as you suggest.</text>

            <text syncTime="215.734" offset="1011822">In other words, they didn't say that if you have an employer who treats members of one sex one way and members of another sex another way there would still be no claim under title VII if the victim is a male and the perpetrator is a male.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.824" offset="1068142">They didn't say that.</text>
