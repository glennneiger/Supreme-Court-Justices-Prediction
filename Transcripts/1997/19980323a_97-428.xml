            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="149637">We'll hear argument next in Number 97-428, Air Line Pilots Association v. Robert Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.504" offset="183596">Mr. Anker, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jerry_d_anker" startTime="57.753" stopTime="219.193">
            <label>Mr. Jerry D. Anker</label>
            <text syncTime="57.753" offset="380559">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="60.455" offset="391426">Section 211 of the Railway Labor Act permits unions and employers to enter into what are you called agency, shop, or similar forms of union security agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.660" offset="432177">Under an agency shop agreement, represented employees are not required to become union members, but they are required to support the union financially through the payment of the equivalent of union dues, initiation fees, and assessments.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.022" offset="493722">However, in a line of cases stretching back now more than 35 years, this Court has said that a union may not use such an agreement to require objecting nonmembers to pay for union activities that are political and ideological in nature or are otherwise unrelated to the collective bargaining function.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.352" offset="578986">In 1986, in Chicago Teacher's Union v. Hudson, the Court went one step further and held that unions must provide three procedural safeguards to ensure that objectors' funds will not be spent improperly, and those safeguards are, first a notice containing an adequate explanation of how the fee is calculated, second, a reasonably prompt opportunity to challenge the fee before an impartial decisionmaker, and third, an escrow for the amounts reasonably in dispute while those challenges are pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.942" offset="717330">The issue in this case is whether employees who wish to challenge the fee that they're being charged must present their claim to that impartial decisionmaker before bringing any kind of a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.750" offset="768635">This case arose in November of 1991, when the Airline Pilots Association, or ALPA, as we called it, entered into an agency shop agreement with Delta Airlines, very much like the agency shop agreements ALPA has with most of the country's airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.914" offset="849196">Before the agreement even became effective, five Delta pilots, later joined by about 150 intervenors, filed a lawsuit to enjoin implementation of that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.089" offset="905934">They had many grounds for their lawsuit, but for present purposes the only one that's relevant here was the allegation that ALPA does not, or does charge objectors improperly for activities which are outside the scope of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.801" offset="980749">Now, ALPA has written procedures in compliance with the Hudson decision that include an impartial decisionmaker for the purpose of resolving such disputes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3255.896" offset="13173141">First of all, there's been a lot of discussion by Mr. LeJeunesse about the intent of the statute, and I think it's clear to say that the statute simply sheds no light whatsoever on the question that's before us, and that's not unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.937" offset="13221310">Very often these exhaustion questions are not resolved by any statute, and certainly this one doesn't have anything whatsoever to say on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.079" offset="13257882">Now, when the statute is silent, what this Court has said... and I think this is really the ultimate answer to the questions that were asked of me earlier by Justice Ginsburg and others, where does the authority come from to require this exhaustion, this Court has said on several different occasions that exhaustion of an administrative remedy or an arbitration remedy, as in Hudson, as in Republic Steel v. Maddox is a matter of judicial discretion.</text>
