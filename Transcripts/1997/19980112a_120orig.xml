Justice Holmes indicated in the Central Railroad case that under Article II, New York had retained its present jurisdiction of and over Ellis Island, which he interpreted to mean was the States intended to preserve the status quo ante, and the status quo that existed in 1834 was a situation where Ellis Island was on the New Jersey side of the boundary, it was a 2-3/4 acres of fast land to mean high water, it was owned by the Federal Government, who had acquired it in 1808 from the State of New York, and it was utilized as a military fort.</text>

            <text syncTime="792.461" offset="3324891">They had ceded everything to the Federal Government, and the island had been used in those days as a military fort for the exclusive purposes of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.206" offset="3363866">It was a Federal enclave, and New York had no presence there, and New York exercised no jurisdiction there, and so therefore that is the present jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.891" offset="3402632">And if you perceive that to be a lower, some lesser element of jurisdiction, it certainly is supported by the factual record, which shows that this was a Federal enclave subject to Federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.777" offset="3450175">The Special Master also determined that New York had failed to establish its affirmative defense of prescription and acquiescence, and on this point, too, we think that the Special Master's analysis was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.348" offset="3516421">We urge the Court to accept it.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.003" offset="3523004">Again, as I mentioned, this was an island that was under the Federal Government's exclusive control.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.798" offset="3546201">This was true prior to the filling in 1890, which commenced in 1890, and it was certainly true right on through the period, the immigration period which New York focuses on so strenuously.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.120" offset="3599491">There was little opportunity for either State to exercise jurisdiction in the Federal enclave, and our view is that that being the case, New York could not establish the requisite degree of government dominion and control in order to place New Jersey on notice that it was prescribing jurisdiction over this territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.253" offset="3680052">What is more, New Jersey did not acquiesce in the purported assertion of jurisdiction by the State of New York, and as the record amply demonstrates, there were extensive instances where New Jersey either took prescriptive acts, or asserted claims to the territory which were sufficient enough to establish New Jersey's assertion that there was nonacquiescence in New York's claims, so on this point, too, we think the Special Master was correct.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear</label>
            <text syncTime="1195.813" offset="4938318">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.105" offset="4979487">The master correctly rejected New York's contention that Article Second of the Compact of 1834 gives New York sovereignty over the filled areas of Ellis Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.133" offset="5019611">The Compact was written against a back-drop of common law rules respecting coastal boundaries, and those rules recognized that avulsive changes such as the addition of fill did not change the location of the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.004" offset="5063079">The Compact does not address fill, and it does not purport to alter the common law rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.298" offset="5088261">As a result, the Compact should be interpreted as following the common law and therefore granting and preserving New Jersey's sovereignty over the filled areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.529" offset="5125146">Now, the master was also correct in rejecting New York's contention that the filled portions of Ellis Island became territory of New York through the doctrine of prescription and acquiescence, and we think the single most important consideration on this score is the fact that the United States exercised dominant and virtually exclusive jurisdiction over the island during the relevant time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.801" offset="5218247">Now, the United States presence is important for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.548" offset="5233189">First, the United States recognized New Jersey's claim to the filled lands by purchasing that area from New Jersey and by indicating in subsequent maps that it was situated in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.419" offset="5280731">Second, the United States' dominant sovereign presence prevented New York from taking those acts of sovereignty that would have established its claim of entitlement to the filled areas, and likewise would have put New Jersey on notice of the fact that New York was making such a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.240" offset="5351993">Now, New York also makes a claim that New Jersey is guilty of laches in this case, but that really adds nothing to New York's claim in this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.674" offset="5389714">As this Court indicated in Illinois v. Kentucky, the equitable defense of laches is subsumed within the doctrine of prescription and acquiescence, so nothing is added by making those types of charges here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.437" offset="5432764">Now, although we agree with the Master's determination of the historic boundary on Ellis Island, we disagree with his ultimate remedy, which would reconfigure the boundary based on considerations of practicality and convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.039" offset="5487203">We think it's important to note at the outset that New Jersey asked this Court to determine the historic boundary line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.068" offset="5511340">It did not request that the Court withdraw the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.802" offset="5522207">Neither did New York make such a request, as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.066" offset="5531298">But equally important, the master's proposal would require this Court to exceed its historic role in determining--</text>

            <text syncTime="2204.235" offset="8971938">New Jersey, and Jersey City, and Hoboken, had been extensively expanded by landfill, 750 acres of made land, as it's called, on Manhattan Island by the time of the Compact, the 4/10ths of an acre that I mentioned on Ellis Island already.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.542" offset="9033169">Moreover, as a... as the 1836 coastal survey map that's part of the record very vividly shows, the water around Ellis Island was extremely shallow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.350" offset="9072457">It was a foot or two deep around Ellis Island at the most.</text>

            <text syncTime="2243.423" offset="9128777">So the use of landfill not only was foreseeable on Ellis Island, but had already occurred, so it certainly was something that the compactors had in their mind, and it is referred to in the Compact.</text>
