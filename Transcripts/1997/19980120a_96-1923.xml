            <text syncTime="204.159" offset="963031">Well, in the context... specifically, the context in Gerlach was a context where the operator of a business selling heavy equipment, selling John Deere tractors, initially got an extension of credit from John Deere, legitimately, but later on they got an extension of that credit by submitting false invoices to show they were doing business that they weren't doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.354" offset="1047772">The Court in Gerlach said that the later extensions of credit involved the obtaining of money by fraud, and as a result the entire amount of the debt that was owed was, in fact, covered by (a)(2), even though there might in that case be no damages at all, so I... the only point I want to make is that our point is that in (a)(2) you're dealing with what was obtained.</text>

            <text syncTime="296.280" offset="1331462">I guess that's the point that I want to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.291" offset="1339507">Back briefly to the facts of this case, which I think are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.248" offset="1363331">The respondents here are some of the tenants of an 18-unit apartment building that was owned by the petitioner and his father between 1985 and 1989.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.661" offset="1401052">When their apartment rental business failed in the late eighties as a result of falling real estate values, petitioner filed bankruptcy under Chapter 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.856" offset="1433862">Thereafter, the rent control administrator entered an order to the effect that there had been an overcharge of these tenants which amounted to $31,000 and the bankruptcy court held that the overcharge was nondischargeable under the (a)(2) provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.498" offset="1496347">The court found further that actual fraud existed in that case on the ground that the act of charging rents was itself an implicit representation of their legality and, second, that petitioner's recklessness in failing to determine what the correct rents were was sufficient to establish an intent to deceive and, finally, the bankruptcy court held that because the overcharges amounted to fraud, treble damages were appropriate under the New Jersey consumer fraud statute and then found that that amount, indeed, also was nondischargeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.297" offset="1623615">Our view is, as is apparent already, I guess, that that result is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.314" offset="1647648">It's wrong essentially for three reasons: 1) the plain language of the statute, which talks about debts for money, property, services, extensions of credit to the extent obtained by fraud clearly doesn't include the amounts that are punitive in nature--</text>

            <text syncTime="475.589" offset="2048784">I think that the interpret... the language prior to 1984 was language that said, debt for obtaining money, property, et cetera, by fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.413" offset="2083997">Now, we think that's ambiguous language.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.776" offset="2093506">There are a couple of cases, literally only a couple, that held necessarily that that language does, in fact, reach punitive amounts, and we don't think that it is illogical to reach that result, but what is important is that prior to 1984 and prior to 1978 even more so, there was... there were not occasions that came up that made courts decide this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.062" offset="2194652">The main reason is that with the presence of the (a)(6) language that talks about debts for wilful and malicious injury, with that language being there, any time conduct results in wilful and malicious injury, it doesn't matter what (a)(2) means, or what is now (a)(2) means.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.871" offset="2261839">It doesn't matter what it means to have a debt for obtaining, and so courts in deciding these cases, as we talk in some detail about in footnotes 13 and 14 of our reply brief, of the yellow brief, the courts typically didn't focus specifically on the meaning of that prior language.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.875" offset="2329862">They didn't have a reason to, and so it isn't possible to say here, as the Court has said in a number of cases, there was an important pre-1978, or pre-1984 bankruptcy practice that had been established.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.231" offset="2379285">Indeed, there was no clear practice that had been established.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.563" offset="2392660">It is not our mission here to tell you that the meaning of those words, if it mattered what the pre-'78 words meant and you didn't have (a)(6) and you had to decide, might a court decide that they in fact meant to include punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.615" offset="2456817">Maybe they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.905" offset="2462041">It isn't clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.936" offset="2466116">I would only say that, when reviewing... what you review Justice Breyer for the Court's opinion in the O'Gilvie case, which talks about, under the different statute, under the IRS statute, whether damages on account of personal injury, whether those include punitive damages, and the Court ruled that they did not, if that is an admissible result, it seems to me it's certainly admissible to conclude... one could conclude that... that a debt for obtaining money by fraud doesn't include it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1574.758" offset="6445401">When considered in light of the history and structure of the code, the clear purpose of the phrase, to the extent obtained by fraud, is to distinguish between legally obtained property or money and fraudulently obtained money or property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.179" offset="6499109">In fact, the precise language that was used in the amendment was taken from a case, In re Danns, a Second Circuit case, which discussed that very issue, noted that there was a conflict in authority, and held that in a situation where a debtor obtains money through a legal credit transaction and then subsequently commits an act of fraud and then obtains additional money through a refinancing, the amount of money that gives rise to the debt is the amount obtained through fraud, but it's the debt which is nondischargeable, and the debt has been defined and is still defined by the code as the liability on a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.195" offset="6679145">The liability on a claim is the amount that you become liable for as a result of the money that you obtained by fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="1644.773" offset="6725434">I mean, you can say you have a claim for money that someone owes you, using the word, the object of the claim is what you're entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.641" offset="6772977">But you can also say you have a claim for fraud, or a claim for personal injury, and in that case you're using it to refer to the cause of action rather than what you're entitled to, and the point made by your colleague here is that this statute uses the word in different sections in different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.925" offset="6858136">In (4) and in (6) and in (9) it's a claim for death, for personal injury, a claim for wilful injury, and so forth, whereas in this it says a claim for money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.683" offset="6905156">That's quite different.</text>

            <text syncTime="3115.093" offset="12606747">Before 1970 there was a split in the courts on whether or not the full amount of credit was nondischargeable simply because a small portion thereof had been obtained by fraud, and that's the In re Danns decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.419" offset="12652095">The legislative history in 1978 shows that Congress was aware of this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.523" offset="12668500">I believe that the language added in 1984 is most reasonably read as making it unmistakably clear that there must be a parsing process to determine how much was obtained by fraud, how much was not obtained by fraud, and all of the liability on a claim for the portion that was obtained by fraud is nondischargeable, and that liability may include consequential and punitive damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="3206.872" offset="12973924">The amount of liability is that amount which would be imposed by a State court and that amount, in this case, is three times the injury so imposed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3228.046" offset="13058561">I just want to make one point, and it relates to Justice Breyer's hypothetical about the credit card situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.648" offset="13076951">I would submit that a broad reading of this provision here so as to essentially use the prior language, read broadly, as it's read in (a)(6), reading debt for obtaining money by fraud creates... that broad reading to include all essentially consequential, punitive, and other damages would create a situation where a credit card company who could come in and argue reckless fraud with regard to the $20,000 that was spent, and then can argue $30,000 more in interest at 18 percent under their contract and then can argue another $10,000 in attorney's fees, that in that circumstance they can come in and make a credible, if not a winning argument that in fact all of that is something that's entitled to nondischarge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.369" offset="13255837">Now, that is something that's a real life issue.</text>
