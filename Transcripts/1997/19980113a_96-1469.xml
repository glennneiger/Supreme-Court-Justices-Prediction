            <text syncTime="315.500" offset="1406425">The reasonableness of the method of making the entry would be assessed by looking at what force was necessary to get in quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.125" offset="1440907">The remedy that might occur if the officers engaged in excessive property damage, we submit, would be compensation for the damaged property and not necessarily the exclusion of the evidence, for if the officers had properly made a no-knock entry supported by reasonable suspicion but not engaged in the unnecessary property damage, they still would have found the same evidence, and they would have found the same evidence at the same time, so the remedy that would be appropriate in the case of needless property damage would be compensation and not the imposition of the exclusionary rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="890.847" offset="3707813">Well, as the law of knock and announce developed, it developed in the law of civil trespass where property owners brought trespass actions against law enforcement officers for unlawfully entering premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.564" offset="3762670">Now, the legislative history, even into the New York statute, is not clear as to why the New York drafters of their statutes put it into the law, but one theory might be that the... New York and in Congress wanted to create an affirmative grant of authority to officers so that they could avoid trespass actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.117" offset="3836962">But that's just speculation on our part, because there is... the historical evidence simply is not clear as to why certain aspects of the common law of knock and announcement were specifically written into 3109 and others that had been well-recognized, including officer safety, from the 1822 decision of Reed v.

            <text syncTime="953.467" offset="3958275">Let me point out that the Ninth Circuit's twotier rule places an unreasonable burden on law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.851" offset="3987846">No-knock entries routinely involve some damage to property.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.266" offset="4005504">In the Richards case, for instance, the officers had to ram the door and kick it in in order to make the entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.069" offset="4028701">If officers need more than reasonable suspicion to justify a no-knock entry involving property damage, they may have to face the choices of having evidence suppressed at trial or facing greater personal risks when knocking and announcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.797" offset="4091604">We submit that the officer should not be forced to make that kind of calculus at a dangerous situation such as executing warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.534" offset="4122638">Moreover, the Ninth Circuit's approach provides no practical guidance to officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.718" offset="4143326">Warrant execution entails high risks and requires split-second judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.529" offset="4162553">It is unclear what level of information will meet the higher tier of specificity required by the Ninth Circuit.</text>
