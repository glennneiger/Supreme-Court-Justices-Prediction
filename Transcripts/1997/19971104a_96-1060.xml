            <text syncTime="1301.558" offset="5355128">Two of the Government's justifications for drawing the distinction that it draws are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.930" offset="5376548">One, there are differences in problems of proof, and your answer to that is, well, in this day of genetic testing, those problems really have evaporated, and I'll assume that for the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.899" offset="5424509">The second major justification that the Government brings up is that there is a difference, depending on whether the single citizen parent is male or female, depending... which affects the likelihood of the attachment of the child to the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.781" offset="5495980">The Government says, look, most children stay with their mothers when they're young, just as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.764" offset="5519908">That's the way it happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.384" offset="5526387">If, in fact, the mother is a citizen, then the child is likely to be in the company of an American citizen, and I suppose most American citizens tend to, sooner or later, come back to the United States, even if they were abroad at some point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.887" offset="5600470">So the Government's argument is, the likelihood is that the child who is born to the female citizen will in fact, because of the mother's company and because of the mother's probable residence, gain an attachment to the United States, whereas that will not necessarily be so if in fact the mother is an alien and it's the father who in Justice Stevens' example comes back from the service assignment at some point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.865" offset="5708304">Is there something unsound factually about the Government's argument, and is there something illegitimate, constitutionally, to the Government's argument?</text>

            <text syncTime="1741.475" offset="7114736">The Naturalization Clause of the Constitution commits to Congress the power that is inherent in any sovereign nation to determine which aliens abroad will be granted United States citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.393" offset="7162488">As this Court said in the Ginsberg decision, no alien has the slightest right to naturalization unless all statutory conditions are satisfied, any by the same token, the Court has said in the Rogers v. Belli decision that was just cited, no United States citizen has a right to transmit citizenship by dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.203" offset="7237721">Now, to be sure, where the interests of the United States citizen are properly before the Court, and in this case we suggest that they're not, but where they are, such as in Fiallo or Kleindienst v. Mandel, this Court has declined to hold that Congress' judgments in this area are wholly beyond judicial review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1795.889" offset="7332388">One was essentially, while couched as a standing ground was essentially a merits argument, and that is that his argument of gender-based discrimination was foreclosed by Fiallo v. Bell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.737" offset="7379827">The Government also argued essentially that because the claim to citizenship was that of the petitioner here and not his own, that he effectively had no ability to insist that the Government confer citizenship on her.</text>

            <text syncTime="2845.034" offset="11529012">One of the parties to the transaction is an alien abroad, not even protected by the Constitution at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2868.481" offset="11622844">There, the Court was dealing with a categorical exclusion of women from the institution, and the Court was concerned with closing the door and denying opportunities to men and women, as the Court put it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2999.747" offset="12147905">But there's a very different... if I may just go... explain what's different about this case, this... I think it is clear that at the moment of birth there is a categorical difference between the mother and the father of the U.S. citizen and the mother because, as I described earlier, in the child born out of wedlock, the mother has a legal relationship with the child from the moment of birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.300" offset="12230034">The father does not, unless the father or someone else takes a step in law to establish that relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="3033.520" offset="12282906">The question is, was that legal relationship established during the child's minority, because the legal relationship is not just important in its own right.</text>

            <text syncTime="3055.636" offset="12371409">One step in that argument, as I understand it, is that because the mother is the citizen, the child will be with the mother, the mother has an attachment to the United States, therefore ultimately that will foster an attachment of the child to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.156" offset="12429505">My question is, should we take that argument seriously when in fact the statute requires of the citizen's mother that she have an attachment only to the extent of once at any time having lived for 1 year prior to birth in the United States?</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.247" offset="12501812">That doesn't seem to me to be a criterion that calls for very much sense of attachment and if, in fact, that's the low value that the United States is willing to put on this attachment concept, isn't the argument a very weak argument, if not perhaps a sham?</text>

            <text syncTime="3104.516" offset="12566909">With all respect, I think that very situation shows why Congress has particularly broad deference in this area, because what... Congress has to judge not only the situation in the United States and the U.S. citizen who may have a stake in it, but what is the situation abroad in the foreign country where, after all, the child was born?</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.778" offset="12639948">And as we explain in our brief, Congress was very concerned, and the legislative history makes this quite clear, that a child born to a U.S. citizen on foreign soil, and this remains true in the Philippines, that child does not have citizenship of the country where she is born, so there's a very real problem of statelessness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.551" offset="12711105">So what Congress is weighing there is perhaps a weaker tie to the United States, but perhaps no legal status at all in the country of birth, and so what Congress did there is to say, in that situation, because we are concerned for the child and for the mother of the child, who is a U.S. citizen, we are prepared to accept a somewhat weaker link to the United States in that situation because of the counterbalance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3275.412" offset="13250482">At the time the Court decided Fiallo this Court has already decided Craig v. Boren and concluded that gender distinctions in the domestic context have to be justified as having a substantial relation to an important governmental interest, and also applied heightened scrutiny with respect to illegitimacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.100" offset="13309309">But right contemporaneously with that... and this case is really about children born out of wedlock, and as in this Court's decision in Lehrer v.

            <text syncTime="3304.059" offset="13365107">Anyone who wanted to establish the requisite relationship during the child's minority, and that's the period that Congress was focusing on, all that person had to do prior to 1986 was to provide for legitimation of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.546" offset="13411082">Congress in 1986 liberalized that, not requiring a formal court to create it, not requiring the father to go to another country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.890" offset="13436473">All he had to do was file a statement with the State Department acknowledging the paternity of the child and assuming an obligation equivalent to that of the mother that flows from that, even in the absence of a legal relationship, the acknowledgment, the promise to support that would flow from the mother's preexisting legal relationship with the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.173" offset="13509616">And if I may, with respect to the suggestion of the irresponsible parent, or the parent who may abandon, I don't think Congress is required to establish a statutory scheme on the possibility that someone in the other category may not live up to the legal responsibilities that the law prescribes, but in any event, this statute applies equally as to both categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.766" offset="13591954">The mother who bears the child and either abandons or gives the child up a week later, that child is a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.191" offset="13617659">The same is true for a father who acknowledges or legitimates a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.714" offset="13631765">If that father does not subsequently remain responsible, that child remains a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.205" offset="13649737">The question is simply the timing of when the father steps forward to assume his responsibilities for the child abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.020" offset="13672934">And one other point to bear in mind, in many cases... and this is not a generalization about the nature of men and women.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.894" offset="13700415">It's a statistical legal fact that in the cases of a child born out of wedlock, when you have a U.S. citizen mother, that will very often be the only parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.350" offset="13734269">Where you have a U.S. citizen father who takes the steps to legitimate and the other steps, that means there are two parents with a legal relationship, one parent here and one parent in the other country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.805" offset="13776065">So this is a situation which, in fashioning these categorical schemes, Congress necessarily has to balance the different considerations that arise, and so it's not just the question of the U.S. citizen parent.</text>
