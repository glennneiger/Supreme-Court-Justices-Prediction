            <text syncTime="3199.967" offset="12951385">Justice O'Connor, the... the need for a policy, even back in 1985, is... is exemplified by the knowledge by that time of sexual harassment in the work place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.030" offset="13019617">The EEOC's policy requiring employers to do something had been on the books since 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.443" offset="13045321">There was widespread knowledge about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.116" offset="13052009">The movie, 9 to 5&gt; ["], people knew sexual harassment was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.586" offset="13069876">And the... and the... the problem with the Court of Appeals' approach is that it discourages persons to come forward and... I'm sorry... it discourages employers from having the kind of policy that will bring these reports to their attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.653" offset="13166112">As Judge Tjoflat noted in dissent, this rewards ostrich like behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.615" offset="13185965">It's hear no evil, see no evil, pay no lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3266.633" offset="13218043">Justice Ginsburg, my position is that if there was a policy, it would not make an automatic difference, that... but it would be a factor to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.730" offset="13266422">Now, they had a policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.410" offset="13273214">They just didn't tell anybody about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.581" offset="13281886">And, in fact, the policy said, on the issue of whether or not Mr. Gordon had an obligation to... to report, the policy, which is found at page 267 of the joint appendix, says, in pertinent part, a... speaking about the EEOC guidelines Under the guidelines, an employer is responsible for the actions of its supervisory employees or agents and, in some cases, for the acts of others when the employer or a supervisory employee knows of, or should have known, the behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.882" offset="13399019">Now, Mr. Gordon knew of the behavior.</text>

            <text syncTime="3317.065" offset="13419813">He did not report it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.125" offset="13423992">The behavior of which he knew, Justice Souter, was of... just like discrimination against African Americans.</text>

            <text syncTime="3330.063" offset="13471744">This is two supervisors, for whatever purpose, engaging in the crudest treatment possible of these two women.</text>

            <text syncTime="3343.473" offset="13525452">It is the same kind of behavior that, were it to have been directed to an African American, were he to have been called these epithets, and were he to have been badgered repeatedly, there would be no question that this was discrimination.</text>
