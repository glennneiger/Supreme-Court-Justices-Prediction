            <text syncTime="29.261" offset="265474">The Coal Act of 1992 is an unprecedented statute as applied to Eastern Enterprises and it is contrary to the constitutional traditions embodied in the Fifth Amendment for two distinct reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.348" offset="317823">First, the Coal Act violates the Due Process Clause because it changes the legal consequences of past employment relationships that concluded long ago at a time when Eastern could not have anticipated any future obligation to former employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="3011.249" offset="12193402">I'm here on behalf of the trustees of the Combined Benefit Fund and the beneficiaries for whom they are fiduciaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.822" offset="12219733">I think it's easy in the midst of the argument here to lose sight of the human dimension of this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.546" offset="12242616">That's the dimension that Congress focused on when it acted in 1992.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.630" offset="12258917">Congress faced an imminent crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.711" offset="12275217">The collective bargaining agreement that was in force at the time Congress acted had less than four months to run and at the end of that collective bargaining agreement the employers who had signed that collective bargaining agreement like Eastern, like the other employers that have submitted briefs to the Court could have made the very same argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.495" offset="12358391">They could have said that our obligation to contribute was for the term of this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.770" offset="12379498">Now, let me make sure that we are clear on what the historical record was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.514" offset="12402486">The historical record was that in 1946 President Truman seized the mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.596" offset="12422757">The secretary of the interior and the union negotiated collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.439" offset="12442192">From that time forward, there were health care benefits provided for miners, spouses, dependents in the coal industry funded by contributions by the employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.847" offset="12483779">That continued year after year after year for almost 50 years by the time Congress acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.541" offset="12514603">In 1974, for the first time, the collective bargaining agreement made a specific reference to beneficiaries retaining a health services card until death or for life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.178" offset="12569147">In 1978, there were further changes in the collective bargaining agreement and now, although the collective bargaining agreement prescribed specific contribution amounts per time or per hour, the employers were given the right to increase those contribution amounts as needed to guarantee the benefits that were specified in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.474" offset="12662247">So by the time Congress acted in 1992, we had been under a regime for the last 14 years in which there had been a specific set of guaranteed benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.711" offset="12703207">Now, Mr. Montgomery's client, Eastern, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Eastern Associated, signed not one, not two, but three collective bargaining agreements that guaranteed these benefits--</text>

            <text syncTime="3491.046" offset="14112566">The bill was a little different, Justice O'Connor, the bill had two features.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.617" offset="14122910">With respect to those beneficiaries who could be assigned to former employers that had signed the '78 or later agreement, those former employers had to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.076" offset="14164706">With respect to the beneficiaries who could not be assigned either because they had no former employer in business or because it was all pre-1978, there was a fee imposed across the board on the industry as a whole whether or not there was any relationship to the collective bargain multiemployer system, and that bill was part of a larger bill, an omnibus tax bill, that was vetoed, and of course we don't know precisely why it was vetoed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.684" offset="14287168">We do know that there was nothing in the veto message that specified any objection to that particular bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.118" offset="14308902">Congress made the decision to impose this liability on all NBCWA signatories and as I understand the argument here, Petitioner says that any of these decisions that Congress might have made would have been fine except for the one that they did make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.919" offset="14380060">They could have imposed it on the taxpayers, they could have imposed it on the coal industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.403" offset="14398032">They could have imposed it only on the '78 or later signatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.244" offset="14409421">They could have imposed it on the '88 signatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.686" offset="14419139">All of that would have been fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.108" offset="14424781">Just this particular choice is not fine, and with all respect, I think that ignores the nature of this multiemployer system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.302" offset="14453621">As the Second Circuit said in upholding the statute in the LTV case, this system contained this latent problem or what the Court of Appeals called the latent loophole from the beginning because as employers like Eastern accorded their beneficiaries service credits and built up that 20 years that you needed to get the health care, those, and beneficiaries were accumulating and they were staying around but some of the employers were leaving and that was the problem that was inherent in the system.</text>
