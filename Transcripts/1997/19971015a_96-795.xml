            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="151637">We'll hear argument next in Number 96-795, Allentown Mack Sales and Service v. National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.658" offset="194269">Mr. Shawe.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_d_shawe" startTime="55.358" stopTime="168.434">
            <label>Mr. Stephen D. Shawe</label>
            <text syncTime="55.358" offset="373051">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="58.210" offset="384440">Picking up on the commentary in Curtin Matheson, this case brings to the Court's attention the issue of whether deference to the board is owing when the board applies the same standard to three different approaches to challenging a union's continuing majority status.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.682" offset="458315">In Curtin Matheson this Court acknowledged the board's oft-articulated standard that an employer can withdraw recognition from an incumbent union if 1) the union has in fact lost its majority status, or 2) the employer has, based on objective considerations, reasonable grounds to doubt the union's continued majority status.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.217" offset="544414">The second test supposedly can be satisfied by a lower threshold of proof, although the board typically requires clear, cogent, concise articulations by individual employees disaffected totalling a majority, or a head count.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.350" offset="621005">But conducting a secret ballot poll is not the same as withdrawing recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.466" offset="649426">Obviously, in the withdrawal of recognition the employer has preempted any vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.508" offset="669593">In contrast, a secret ballot poll assuming fairness consistent with the board's Struksnes standards permits of the possibility that a majority will vote in favor of continued union representation, and the board in Texas Petrochemicals and its brief disclaims any interest or desire to do away with employer polls.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.764" offset="766664">The board's standard for permitting an employer to take the grave and precipitous step of withdrawing recognition should not at the same time be applied in the contradictory context of secret ballot polling.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="168.434" offset="825283">Well, why is it contradictory?</text>
            <text syncTime="169.725" offset="830507">I mean, I thought there was a rational structure for all of this along the following lines:</text>
            <text syncTime="175.959" offset="855376">The board says, we're at the point at which the presumption is no longer absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.575" offset="889857">The employer in effect is going to be given three options, subject to the same condition, probable cause to believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.740" offset="926533">The three conditions, the three options, however, have varying risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.227" offset="956522">If the employer simply withdraws recognition and turns out to be wrong, the repercussions are presumably going to be very great.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.122" offset="996124">If the employer asks for an election, perhaps the repercussions may not be so great, but they're going to be serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.530" offset="1029665">If the employer decides to take a poll, the repercussions... and loses, the repercussions perhaps will not be quite so great.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.575" offset="1061848">That's not quite so disruptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.107" offset="1068013">What is irrational about saying, subject to the same fact premise, the employer is going to be given an option of going A, B, or C, depending on the degree of risk that the employer wants to run if the employer turns out to be wrong?</text>
