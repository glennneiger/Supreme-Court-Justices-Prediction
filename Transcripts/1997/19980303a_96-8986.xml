            <text syncTime="227.649" offset="1064658">The language in section 1254 is as broad as it could possibly be, and we submit that Congress' choice of the language in section 1254 was intentional.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.386" offset="1103633">It conferred jurisdiction on the court in all cases, not just all appeals, but all cases, all matters, all judicial proceedings that could occur in the court of appeals and that, by its plain terms, would include proceedings of an original matter in the courts of appeals such as an application for a certificate of appealability.</text>

            <text syncTime="265.615" offset="1216586">The case in the court of appeals here is the jurisdictional question of whether the court of appeals had the power under section 2253 to decide the merits, to allow the appeal into the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.893" offset="1269667">That is exactly analogous to the decision that this Court made in Nixon v. Fitzgerald, that the predicate jurisdictional decision to dismiss an appeal for lack of jurisdiction was itself a case in the court of appeals over which this Court has certiorari power under section 1254.</text>

            <text syncTime="371.815" offset="1641337">In 2253, Congress prohibited only one thing from entering the court of appeals absent a certificate, and that is an appeal to the court of appeals from the final order in a proceeding under sections 2255 or section 2254.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.765" offset="1709151">It does not say anything about this Court's certiorari power and that silence is very significant when you consider that that provision was amended at the same time that Congress adopted section 2244(b)(3)(E), in which it expressly proscribed this Court from exercising its certiorari jurisdiction over an analogous gate keeping provision in the successive petition context, and I suggest that Congress had a very good reason for doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.833" offset="1813432">It would have been much more concerned about the accuracy of the gate keeping decision in the first habeas petition context than it would have been in the successive petition context.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.619" offset="1852511">In the successive petition context, it is guaranteed that a prisoner has gotten a full right of review through the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.993" offset="1878007">In this context, with Mr. Hohn, for example, no court has yet actually reviewed the merits of his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.157" offset="1906741">He was kicked out on an invalid waiver doctrine in the district court, and he was kicked out on an invalid ruling on the meaning of section 2253, as the Government has conceded in the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.396" offset="1951672">He is a Federal prisoner who has never had any hearing on his collateral claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1851.127" offset="7558594">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.501" offset="7588061">At the same time Congress in 1996 was most conspicuously streamlining habeas review, the Federal Government and petitioner having proposed an interpretation of that legislation that multiplies by a factor of two or three the avenues of appellate relief available to individual Federal prisoners or State prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.004" offset="7674056">The twin vehicles for this development are 1) a theory of statutory certiorari that has never received the vote of a single justice of this Court and has been positively rejected by several decisions of this Court and, second, a theory of common law certiorari that has not been used meaningfully in an opinion by this Court since the end of World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.939" offset="7757856">It would seem quite anomalous to resurrect the one theory and create the other in the one area of the Court's jurisdiction that is now most expressly regulated by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.135" offset="7802578">I submit that that's not what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.236" offset="7811042">I'd like, Justice Breyer, to address your question about... and the Nixon cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.671" offset="7836746">The key difference between the Nixon cases and this one is the gate keeping decision is really not a jurisdiction decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.346" offset="7863496">Yes, it ultimately may have jurisdictional consequences, but keep in mind, when a court of appeals judge denies the certificate, that does not mean no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.212" offset="7898918">The inmate can go to this Court, obtain a certificate... at that point there might be jurisdictional consequences, but of course at that point the review that is being sought is not just of what the circuit judge did, but also of what that circuit justice did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.072" offset="7950327">That's extremely odd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.421" offset="7955760">I'm not aware of another jurisdictional statute where individuals, whether inmates or not, can argue that a court of appeals made a mistake in a court of appeals panel or a court of appeals judge where this Court has already had an opportunity to look at the matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="3320.713" offset="13436981">I cannot imagine all of the situations in which an important procedural issue might arise that this Court would need to resolve, but there may be questions that go to the heart of section 2253 that Congress would want this Court to have the authority to resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.522" offset="13492152">There was a point about... I... about the state of the law at the time that House was decided, and I... we have stated our position in the letter that we submitted, but I just want to clarify that the question... the question that Mr. Sutton has raised and the question about the legislative history is whether the 1925 act retracted the power that the 1908 act had conferred on circuit justices to grant certificates of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.770" offset="13601135">The language of section 13 strongly suggests that the only part of the 1908 act that was retracted was the part that required direct appeal to the Supreme Court and that justices retained their power to grant certificates.</text>

            <text syncTime="3398.824" offset="13749406">Many of these are simply not published and they're not available, and I think I can make a recommendation... representation that I've asked the Clerk of the Court about... or the Librarian about how to get this, and it's very difficult to find, so we don't know whether they occurred or didn't occur during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.227" offset="13818996">It's certainly true that House didn't mention it, but House also did not mention another form of relief that was available, and that was an original petition for habeas corpus to this Court, which House had indeed sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.593" offset="13860478">The existence of that remedy did not deter the Court in holding that it had common law certiorari power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.777" offset="13885138">In addition, the question about whether the 1911 act's definition of circuit judge applies, the fact is that the 1925 act did not even use the language, circuit judge, so the definition of circuit judge is sort of irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.635" offset="13940622">The only question is whether the 1925 act eliminated the power of the circuit justices that the 1908 act had created.</text>
