            <text syncTime="9.497" offset="188020">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="12.683" offset="200768">The case that is before the Court today involves the question of whether an 1894 Act of Congress had the intent and the effect of disestablishing the Yankton Sioux Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.115" offset="246534">The State submits that the answer is conclusively yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.036" offset="262208">And we base that "yes" on several factors, the first and not least of which is the use of "cession and sum certain" language in the operative... or terms... in the operative section of the agreement and the ratifying Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.952" offset="321871">That particular "cession and sum certain", the cession, sale, relinquishment and conveyance of all interests in and to the unalloted land, together with the sum certain, has been held by this Court to create an almost insurmountable presumption, or a nearly conclusive presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.039" offset="398149">And we would submit to the Court that that, in combination with the immediate uptake of jurisdiction by the State of South Dakota in 1895, and continuously uncontested State jurisdiction during the next 100 years, and throwing that together with the fact that that jurisdiction was exercised without objection by the Tribe and without an attempt to exercise jurisdiction by the Tribe or the Federal Government throughout those 100 years, and that's not merely our contention but that also is the observation... excuse me... of both the Eighth Circuit and the... both the majority and dissenting opinion, as well as the opinion of the unanimous State of South Dakota Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.380" offset="563556">And then, add into that, as a method of telling us what everybody understood at the time that this Act was passed, pursuant to the agreement with the Yankton Tribe, was what I will call the immediate wholesale settlement of the area by homesteaders, or what the District Court referred to as the rapid settlement and the loss... the quick loss of Indian character in this area, which would suggest, at least to the State, that that would suggest disestablishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.463" offset="679853">We also would submit to you that additional--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="135.836" offset="693332">May I ask you, General Barnett, you use the word "disestablishment", but as I read particularly Judge Magill's decision, his dissenting opinion, he's very careful to speak always about diminishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.001" offset="754041">And you seem to use those words as though they mean the same thing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark W. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="155.765" offset="773058">--Your Honor, I believe that diminishment probably should be read to suggest a case more like Rosebud v. Kneip, where the Court said that as to several counties, the reservation was disestablished, but it still left one county with a compact square of reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.617" offset="848500">And so there was still actually 18 U.S.C., 1151(a)-type reservation country out there, but it was diminished in size.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.082" offset="890400">The case that we have here today... and I think the parties would agree... that the case we are doing today is disestablishment, just like the DeCoteau case, where the Lake Traverse Reservation was found by this Court to be disestablished, meaning there was still no 1151-type--1151(a)-type reservation out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.151" offset="982665">I... I might add, Your Honor, that diminishment and disestablishment at one time were probably not terms of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.930" offset="1009728">In our view, they are now.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.273" offset="1015161">And we are, I think, today here litigating disestablishment.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="219.849" offset="1029476">Even though Judge Magill said that he thought that the District Court erred in holding that the reservation had not been diminished?</text>

            <text syncTime="232.344" offset="1079422">And I... and I do not believe, from reading all of Judge Magill's opinion, that he's trying to suggest that some 1151(a)-type reservation still existed after 1894.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.729" offset="1124980">I think, to be honest, I would suggest to you that... that he was probably using diminishment and disestablishment interchangeably, and that has happened in the history of the... of the court system in other cases as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.865" offset="1173463">Returning for a moment, if I may, to the settlement history that took place out there... and the reason I bring it up is because this Court, on other occasions, has looked to the settlement history immediately after the passage of the Opening Act to help it determine what did everybody understand at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.357" offset="1247442">And in this case, as was suggested by the Court of Claims in 1980... or as was found by that Court... within 3 years of the opening of this reservation, more than 100,000 of these opened acres had been sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.633" offset="1308568">Within 5 years, 90 percent had been sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.350" offset="1319435">And as you will see at joint appendix 475, by 1913, in addition to the ceded lands which had been put up for settlement by the homesteaders, more than twothirds of the allotted lands left to the Indians in 1894 had also been sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.328" offset="1387354">And so--</text>

            <text syncTime="328.587" offset="1464363">And by way of explanation, at the time of trial, 90 percent of all of the land in what we call the disputed area, 90 percent of that former reservation area was in nonIndian hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.925" offset="1517757">Which has been something that the Court has noted in its prior cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.641" offset="1536565">And more than twothirds, or 68 percent, of the population was nonIndian, as found by the Federal census.</text>

            <text syncTime="466.968" offset="2017950">The... as we look at Article XVIII, it seems to the State that the one thing that you cannot do with Article XVIII is read it literally.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.247" offset="2051073">Because if you read it literally, in the strict literal interpretation, then it says that nothing in this Act in effect... or in agreement... in 1892 actually happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.977" offset="2093914">The sale did not happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.226" offset="2098929">The white homesteaders could not move in.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.944" offset="2109796">Part of the 1858 treaty forbade settlers or other whites from coming onto the reservation, with certain narrow exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.191" offset="2142815">And that was in 1858.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.129" offset="2150547">By contrast, in the 1892, and in the Act ratifying it, the exact opposite purpose was there, that... that we are going to have whites come in and settle this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.937" offset="2185760">And... and so, when we try to interpret what Article XVIII says, I think, first, that the... and I suspect the parties would even agree... it cannot be read literally.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.479" offset="2231945">Because then you get absurd results.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.571" offset="2240304">The second thing that I would observe about Article XVIII is that if you read the first sentence of Article XVIII, it says Nothing in this treaty abrogates the 1858 treaty... or nothing in this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.099" offset="2294430">If that's true, all the rest of Article XVIII is surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.893" offset="2309581">If you go to the first phrase in the second sentence, it repeats that phrase, that... that essential statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.765" offset="2341137">And if that's true, what came before and what came after is surpluses.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.467" offset="2355870">And so it seems to me that it can't be read literally.</text>

            <text syncTime="735.126" offset="3090537">And the answer would be No, we are not going to abrogate the 1858 treaty, and you will get your annuities.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.390" offset="3119586">And, indeed, if you look at the report that the commissioner gave to the State of Interior, who then filed with the Congress, in 1893, what you will see is a... is a lengthy description in the record about what all of the Indians concerns were and how these were resolved in the various articles of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.411" offset="3207670">And so there was a long discussion about Pipestone Quarry and a long discussion about scout claims for Indians who had served as scouts and felt they still had money owing.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.657" offset="3248630">A lot of discussion about their concerns.</text>

            <text syncTime="781.810" offset="3277261">And in the second place, when we come to... to what the negotiator is telling Congress the Indians feel about 18, it gets one sentence, and one sentence only in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1596.059" offset="6534312">In the 1858 treaty... and I'd like to go back to that, if I may... the Tribe gave up 11 million acres of land to the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.398" offset="6575586">These were enormous property rights and sovereignty rights that they bargained away in exchange for a 430,000-acre homeland, a reservation that they believed was going to be their permanent home in perpetuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.190" offset="6626786">They... they also got annuities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.985" offset="6649982">But this 430,000 acres was their land that they wanted to retain the Indian character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.155" offset="6678612">They wanted to retain this land forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.310" offset="6691256">And when the government came along, after the allotments in 1892, and said we want to buy what's left over from you, the surplus lands, the Tribe held on so dearly to this 1858 treaty, to their boundaries, to the reservation and their annuities that they refused actually to sign the 1892 agreement until the Federal Government said, okay, we're going to give you Article XVIII, we'll give you school lands, we'll give you the liquor provision that you've asked for.</text>

            <text syncTime="1667.406" offset="6819674">And, as you know, they were handed a form agreement by the government, the Tribe was, that had actually six... six articles in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.825" offset="6849349">And everything else was tagged on... in... insisted upon by the Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.948" offset="6869829">Now, the State has been arguing disestablishment and diminishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.587" offset="6892399">And they use the terms interchangeably.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.209" offset="6898877">They have in their briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.865" offset="6905460">And what they're really asking for is not just diminishment, which would be the case Justice Breyer brought up, that would be carving out a discrete portion or a discrete parcel of the reservation and saying, okay, this is now no longer here, so the reservation boundaries are diminished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.953" offset="6969826">No, what the State is asking for... and I think it's pretty clear in their... in their writings... is termination, total termination of the reservation altogether.</text>

            <text syncTime="2846.556" offset="11536239">At the time, it was thought that Indian character of the land went with Indian ownership.</text>
