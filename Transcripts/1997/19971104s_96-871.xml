            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="8.682" offset="123486">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.339" offset="146055">It stands from a dispute concerning respondent's agreement with State Oil Company to lease and operate a gas station.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.248" offset="181686">Under the agreement the price at which Mr. Khan was obligated to purchase gasoline from State Oil built in a profit margin that Khan could not exceed, thus, through the agreement State Oil imposed a vertical restriction on a maximum resale price of the gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.139" offset="261308">After State Oil instituted eviction proceedings against Khan, he filed suit in Federal District Court alleging in part that State Oil had violated Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act by improperly fixing his gasoline resale prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.581" offset="331107">The District Court entered summary judgment for State Oil on that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.394" offset="350333">The Court of Appeals for Seventh Circuit reversed relying on this Court's opinion in Albrecht v. Herald Co. in which this Court, in the year of 1968, adapted a rule that vertical maximum price fixing is illegal per se under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.791" offset="431939">We granted certiorari to consider whether the per se rule of Albrecht should be overruled in light of subsequent decisions of this Court and a substantial criticism that Albrecht has received.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.744" offset="491708">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals based on our conclusion that any anticompetitive effects of vertical maximum price fixing can be appropriately detected and punished if necessary under the rule of reason applicable to most antitrust claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.007" offset="584808">Although, the doctrine of stare decisis is the preferred course, it is not an inexorable command.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.218" offset="613647">In the area of Antitrust Law, there is a competing interest in recognizing and adapting to change circumstances and to the lessons of accumulated experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.851" offset="660145">We find the conceptual foundations of Albrecht had been so weakened by subsequent developments in antitrust law that it should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.530" offset="702882">Accordingly, we vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand for further consideration of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.721" offset="727646">The decision is unanimous.</text>
