            <text syncTime="199.284" offset="945849">It most assuredly speaks to finality, and, in fact, section 2244 as amended by the Effective Death Penalty Act is entitled finality, interjects res judicata into habeas corpus, and specifically delineates the narrow circumstances under which additional litigation will occur.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.302" offset="1173950">Yes, but finality, as I understand your answer to an earlier question, there isn't a finality issue under the general rule for civil cases, is that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="268.338" offset="1222120">Now, why is there a finality rule here, as Justice Kennedy said, a finality rule here when the action is taken, as we will assume that it was, on the court's own motion?</text>
            <text syncTime="280.807" offset="1271962">The new statute certainly limits what may be done in response to a petition or a request by the habeas petitioner, but how do those provisions enact a, as it were, a finality rule to govern this class of civil cases when there is generally no finality rule and the action is taken by the court on its own motion?</text>

            <text syncTime="309.664" offset="1387423">Well, Your Honor, there's precedent for the actions of the court being considered within the confines of the abuse of the writ doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.691" offset="1427547">In In re Blodgett the court of appeals was instructed of its duty not to delay habeas corpus proceedings.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="328.218" offset="1461611">Well, but that's a different argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.369" offset="1466208">If you want to say that there was an abuse of discretion here I think that's quite a substantial argument, but you're talking about first the fact that it's a successive petition barred by the act, and it just seems to me that that's a very, very rigorous reading of the act, that once the mandate issues you can't correct it even if there's no abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.920" offset="1544471">Your opening argument is that this is a violation of the new act.</text>

            <text syncTime="357.606" offset="1579162">But it seems to me it's abuse of the writ is the more substantial claim.</text>

          <turn speaker="holly_d_wilkens" startTime="362.769" stopTime="395.881">
            <label>Ms. Holly D. Wilkens</label>
            <text syncTime="362.769" offset="1599851">Well, certainly there are several ways to analyze it, and if this Court does not consider that we have passed into the successive petition area within respect to the Effective Death Penalty Act, most assuredly, as this court was informed by the Effective Death Penalty Act in determining Felker, we do not believe that the Ninth Circuit should be any less informed by the limitations upon relitigating the same claims on the same facts and the same law.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="395.881" offset="1732239">Let me go back a moment to the questions I believe Justice O'Connor asked about the general standard for reviewing, recalling a mandate, or for a court, an appellate court... are any of those Federal cases, did the recall of the mandate occur after this Court had denied certiorari?</text>

            <text syncTime="416.636" offset="1815309">I believe there are instances where that has in fact occurred, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="421.049" offset="1832968">I believe so, and again this unique nature of 2254 cases has been repeatedly recognized by this Court, and most recently, even in the Agostini case, there was a citation to Teague as an express acknowledgement as to the distinctions between procedural rule's ordinary application in the ordinary civil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.196" offset="1945503">The recall of the mandate standard is entirely too broad to be applied in a habeas corpus proceeding whether it's upon the court's own motion or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.334" offset="1986045">The effect upon the State's interest remains the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="465.599" offset="2011123">I mean, I thought the Ninth Circuit specifically says at the beginning we're not taking this en banc because of any new evidence, because of anything Thompson did, because of any second or successive claim for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.405" offset="2062323">We're simply doing what we normally do, which is to review a panel en banc if a majority want.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.750" offset="2087714">The only unusual aspect of this is the fact that they issued this sua sponte, isn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="491.765" offset="2115821">They issued this sua sponte, this recall of the mandate, so we have an ordinary recall of a mandate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.989" offset="2140690">I mean, maybe it's an abuse of discretion, maybe it isn't, but I'm simply adding, I'd like to know why it's an abuse of discretion, because that seems to me to be the issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="507.574" offset="2179038">Well, it's most assuredly an abuse of discretion, but we need not even reach the traditional abuse of discretion standard because they're applying the wrong standard, because you must turn to the applicable law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3010.211" offset="12189578">Now, I take it under the appellate rules a litigant could any time, perhaps, or sometime thereafter, or after the petition for rehearing, file a petition en banc, and by the time the court as a whole has considered that petition the 7 days may have passed and the mandate is issued, so obviously, if they grant the en banc they'll jerk the mandate back.</text>

            <text syncTime="3034.509" offset="12286754">Now, given that situation and the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedures, it could happen, which would I think be an abuse, that a court decides on its own 10 years later, you see, to review en banc, and jerks back the mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.668" offset="12347462">Well, that can't be right, so there must be some kind of standard in between what would be the rules foreseeing a not totally unusual circumstance... you know, we as a court of appeals grant the en banc, the mandate went out last week, we'd better jerk it back, because after all we're considering it en banc... and 10 years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.860" offset="12420187">There must be some standard, and you mentioned... or maybe it's a different thing, nothing to do with jerking the mandate back, but whether you can have an en banc at all, all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.288" offset="12461879">I mean, so those are... that's what's going on in my mind, and you mentioned that you had in mind some kind of standard, or some kind of criteria for resolving this problem, and so I'd like to hear it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3139.700" offset="12707534">I assume that had one been able to do that, that either Congress or this Court previously would have done so.</text>

            <text syncTime="3272.288" offset="13237924">Should we consider the fact that the court of appeals, before it exercised its sua sponte authority, waited for all of these other bodies to go through various procedures of review?</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.187" offset="13297483">They sat back to see what would happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.239" offset="13309709">Is that something we should consider, and how does that cut?</text>

            <text syncTime="3292.820" offset="13320053">Well, certainly it is something before the Court, so it may be something that the Court may wish to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.575" offset="13347012">I don't think that it would affect what I believe the proper outcome is in this case, for several reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="3307.910" offset="13380344">Yes, but did... well, because time is short, there's one thing that I wish you would address.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.765" offset="13403854">Does it go to the seriousness with which we should consider the claim that they were trying, in effect, to protect the integrity of their own procedures?</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.753" offset="13447740">Because if that had been weighted given a very high weight, wouldn't they have said, we've got to protect the integrity of our own procedures regardless of what all these other courts and executive agencies may be doing, and would it be fair for us to say, the circuit really did not give a very high weight to the integrity of their procedures, and that bears on whether it was an abuse of discretion?</text>

            <text syncTime="3348.629" offset="13543243">I don't think that one need necessarily view the facts in that fashion, Justice Souter, the reason being that it appears that there was a discussion between the time the mandate returned to the circuit and was sent to the district court and the time that it was spread.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.648" offset="13599354">At that point there were proceedings going on in the State court and, as the opinion points out, for reasons of comity, to use their word, they decided to wait and allow the State court to first address the issues that had been brought to the attention of the State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.406" offset="13654421">It was entirely possible that the California supreme court would have allowed Mr. Thompson a new trial based upon the pleading that was then pending before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.051" offset="13688902">If that were to have occurred, then the Ninth Circuit would not have made... have needed to make public the rather messy story that is now public, and perhaps that speaks to protecting the integrity of the process as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.522" offset="13746790">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.492" offset="13750760">I wasn't privy to those conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.264" offset="13757761">What I do know is that they attempted, I believe in good faith, to return us to the position in which we were before they made these errors, and it was not just the error of two judges misplacing an E mail, or two clerks not speaking to one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.181" offset="13805513">If, indeed, they waited too long, that was an error, and in fact that... the second call after the amended opinion from the panel issued was a timely call under the rules of the court, 5.4.C, and yet the entire court misunderstood the timeliness of that call and no vote was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.882" offset="13876252">If the court had not made a mistake at that point, which may have been due partially to the author of the panel opinion and partially to the en banc coordinator and how their positions were related to the judge who called for the en banc--</text>

            <text syncTime="3456.429" offset="13974473">I'm merely suggesting... and I don't know what the trade off was, obviously, so I don't want to speak for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.963" offset="13992550">I couldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.781" offset="13995893">But let us assume that they decided that they would give the court, the supreme court of the State of California, an opportunity to consider the claims that were before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.049" offset="14028912">If that court were to take one action, then the Ninth Circuit would not have had to pursue this course of action, as it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.274" offset="14061826">There are any number of considerations that would make it advisable for the Ninth Circuit not to have had to go to the lengths that it did go to, which merely underlines for me the seriousness with which they viewed this, and the seriousness with which they viewed their obligation to correct their error to give Mr. Thompson exactly the same right that all others had had to pursue.</text>
