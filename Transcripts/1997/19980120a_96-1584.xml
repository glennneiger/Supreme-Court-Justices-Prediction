            <text syncTime="1076.415" offset="4452196">That is why I'm explaining the claims somewhat, is to show how they fit within the standing requirements of Article III and the exceptions for third party standing as in Powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.706" offset="4497335">Your Honors, I'd also like to direct your attention, if I could, to the State's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.719" offset="4533384">The State in its brief does agree in some forms with the petitioner Campbell's claims on all three grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.762" offset="4569538">With respect to the equal protection ground, at page 22, note 9, the State of Louisiana recognizes this Court's decision that if discrimination in the selection of the grand jury itself occurs, the proper remedy is reversal of the subsequent conviction, and that's what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.192" offset="4635262">There was discrimination in the selection of the grand jury itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.441" offset="4648323">Grand juror number 12 was chosen in a discriminatory manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.237" offset="4663474">With respect to the due process claim on page 26 and note 12, in Guice 2 the Fifth Circuit noted that because the foreman in Louisiana is selected from the venire rather from the grand jury itself, any discrimination in the selection of a foreman necessarily taints the composition of the grand jury as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.761" offset="4737557">Only 11 of its 12 members were chosen at random.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.025" offset="4750618">If that is so, the petitioner may obtain relief by challenging the composition of the grand jury, and this he has failed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.070" offset="4770785">But, in fact, that is what Mr. Campbell has been doing from the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.663" offset="4785205">He's been saying that this twelfth member of the grand jury was chosen in a discriminatory manner, has always been chosen white.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.910" offset="4806207">And on page 30, under the B heading with respect to the Sixth Amendment argument, the State writes, if this Court decides that the Sixth Amendment itself is implicated regardless of whether the judicial body at issue is the grand jury or just the grand jury foreman, then the State concedes that under Holland v. Illinois petitioner has standing to assert a Sixth Amendment challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.714" offset="4889381">It's the law, the Constitution and its amendments and the prior decisions of this Court, that have forced the State to make concessions on these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.226" offset="4915399">In the dissent by Justice Scalia, to which Chief Justice Rehnquist joined in the case of Powers v. Ohio, there's a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.756" offset="4949567">It would be absurd to... and this is at page 1379 in the Supreme Court Recorder 111.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.408" offset="4984153">It would be absurd to suppose that a black juror has a right not to be discriminated against through peremptory strike in the trial of a black defendant but not in the trial of a white defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.559" offset="5024800">However, this is the absurd position the State has taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.902" offset="5034099">An African American prospective grand juror has a right not to be discriminated against in the selection of the grand jury foreperson in cases involving black defendants but not in cases involving white defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.460" offset="5080388">In its conclusion to its brief in page 34 the State says, Louisiana in no way condones race discrimination in the administration of criminal justice in any corner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.673" offset="5129185">However, the State's presence here today shows otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.267" offset="5139634">This Court has the opportunity and has the power to correct the racial discrimination in the administration of criminal justice which is currently accepted in and by the State of Louisiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="1302.056" offset="5354778">Also, insofar as the selection of the foreman is concerned in Louisiana, the judge does not select from the large grand jury venire, the general venire of 300 persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.380" offset="5404098">What happens is that a grand jury venire is brought into the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.707" offset="5421338">It can be as few as 20 and as many as 100, but the grand jury venire is brought into the courtroom, the judge selects the foreman from the grand jury venire after that venire has been shown to satisfy the general qualifications to serve as grand jurors and then the other 11 are chosen.</text>

            <text syncTime="3291.540" offset="13312721">One is that General Ieyoub raised the point that only 9 votes were needed by the grand jury again on that case that would seem to be urging an issue, urging a rule that we could discriminate on 3 out of the 12 grand jury members, still get 9 votes from the other ones and have a valid indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3326.778" offset="13453678">The problem here that there was systematic exclusion by the judge and that Petitioner Campbell has been denied standing to raise these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.475" offset="13500489">Whenever the State has argued against it they start going to the merits of the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.645" offset="13517103">They start saying how he's got to prove this or prove that with respect to due process, yet Petitioner Campbell isn't given an opportunity to prove whether there was a due process violation or an equal protection violation or a Sixth Amendment violation when he's not given standing to assert them.</text>
