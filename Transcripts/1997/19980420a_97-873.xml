            <text syncTime="9.570" offset="176369">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.552" offset="188281">The question in this case is whether the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination may be invoked based on a fear of foreign prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.419" offset="227778">For three main reasons, we submit that it may not.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.832" offset="241362">First, the prohibition against compelling a person to be a witness against himself applies only in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.507" offset="276053">By that phrase, the Framers meant a Federal criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.410" offset="291726">The Self-Incrimination Clause is one of a series of rights set forth in the Fifth and Sixth Amendments that are naturally read to govern criminal trials in this country, not foreign criminal cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="52.972" offset="349927">Mr. Dreeben, in the Arndstein case the Court extended the privilege outside of the scope of a criminal trial, didn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="64.971" offset="397992">The privilege may be claimed by a witness in any proceeding, regardless of whether the proceeding is civil, criminal, or administrative, so long as what the witness ultimately fears is incrimination in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.961" offset="453894">The proper referent to determine whether the Self-Incrimination Clause may be invoked therefor is not the type of proceeding in which it is claimed in this country, but rather the type of proceeding in which the witness actually fears incrimination, and that point is borne out by the history of the clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="104.498" offset="556085">It did involve a false statement to the United States, so why is it seemed to be conceded that there is no criminal case in the United States?</text>

            <text syncTime="114.124" offset="594537">There could be, Justice Ginsburg, if these statements had been made within a period prosecutable under the statute of limitations, but the original statements that respondent made to gain entry to the United States were in 1963, and the general 5-year statute of limitations has long since run on any prosecution for false statements based on that event and, as a result, the witness is not in a position to claim a fear of domestic incrimination based on any contradiction with his prior statements and I think it's conceded in this case that the only claim of self-incrimination is based on what a foreign power might do if it had custody over respondent and instituted a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.852" offset="769453">There is no claim in this case that there is a domestic fear of prosecution by either the State or the Federal Government based on the statements that he has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.028" offset="806234">Now, the history of the Self-Incrimination Clause in this country points strongly to the conclusion that the words, any criminal case, in the Fifth Amendment refer only to a Federal criminal case.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.765" offset="1185114">The two interlinked requirements of the clause are compulsion and incrimination, and the question here is whether the incrimination can be in a case not brought in this country by the Federal Government or a State, but by a foreign Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.573" offset="1240389">That is the question before the Court in this case.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="277.623" offset="1248539">And that's the implication in the latter part, to be a witness against himself, and a witness where is what we're debating.</text>

          <turn speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="285.518" stopTime="382.527">
            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="285.518" offset="1280095">That is exactly right.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.479" offset="1283961">The question is whether it can be triggered based on prosecution abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.454" offset="1299844">Now, if you look at the text of the Fifth and the Sixth Amendments together, which is the logical way to read them because they contain the essential criminal procedure proscriptions that are applicable in trials in this country, the Fifth Amendment seems almost inevitably to be limited to criminal cases brought by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.897" offset="1381659">There can be no dispute that the original intent of the Framers of the Bill of Rights was to impose limitations only on the Federal Government, not on the States, and this Court consistently held, in the era before the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified and thereby made certain constitutional protections applicable to the States, that none of the provisions in the original Bill of Rights govern State proceedings and, as a result, State witnesses could not claim the protection of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.167" offset="1494717">In that regime, in other words, State witnesses who feared incrimination by a State could not say that they feared incrimination in any criminal case, because State prosecutions were not deemed subsumed within the Fifth Amendment, and there are several textual references that make sense only if read that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.237" offset="1570995">The Sixth Amendment refers to all criminal prosecutions, yet it is quite clear that by that reference the Framers did not intend to refer to State criminal prosecutions, and far less sensible would it be to think that they were referring to foreign criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.201" offset="1638913">The only criminal prosecutions that were originally subsumed by the Sixth Amendment were domestic criminal prosecutions.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="382.527" offset="1668170">But that goes to where the compulsion is, not to where the incrimination is, doesn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="388.040" offset="1690217">No, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.011" offset="1694084">I think what it goes to is by what did the Framers mean the words, any criminal case, to refer to?</text>
            <text syncTime="396.146" offset="1722609">Originally they only meant them to refer to a Federal criminal case and, as a result, this Court held that if a Federal witness was compelled to testify, he said, look, I don't have any concern that I'm going to be incriminated in a Federal criminal case, but I am worried that in the State of Maryland I might be incriminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.219" offset="1802962">This Court held that is not a basis for declining to give testimony, because the criminal case in which you fear incrimination is not a Federal criminal case.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="429.938" offset="1857819">And why shouldn't it be that the concern is controlling the conduct of the Federal actor, whether a Federal agent, a police officer... if the amendment is directed against the compulsion, the action that is prohibited is compelling the testimony, why should it matter where the criminal case is instead of who is doing the compelling?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="456.365" stopTime="533.107">
            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="456.365" offset="1963563">Well, Justice Ginsburg, it always has mattered where the criminal case is, and once this Court held in Malloy v. Hogan that the Fifth Amendment applied equally to the States and to the Federal Government, this Court in the Murphy decision changed the former Federal rule and held that the Fifth Amendment may now be claimed whether the prosecution that is feared would occur in a State or in the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.862" offset="2065545">The theory behind that is that any jurisdiction that is bound by the Fifth Amendment should not be able to receive testimony that was compelled by another jurisdiction, also bound by the Fifth Amendment, and use it to convict someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.110" offset="2118521">So under the Murphy decision two jurisdictions, each bound by the Fifth Amendment, cannot evade that constitutional guarantee by having one compel the testimony and the other one use it, but that is a value that primarily relates to the way we try criminal cases in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.513" offset="2184141">Like the presumption of innocence and the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the Fifth Amendment fits into a mosaic of rights that express the view that it is the Government that must prove the defendant's guilt without the assistance of compelling the defendant to incriminate himself out of his own mouth and thereby confess himself into a Federal or a State prison.</text>

            <text syncTime="551.328" offset="2343383">I think that that is one of the components that this Court has identified as a value underlying the Fifth Amendment, but it again relates primarily to a value about how we prosecute individuals in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.406" offset="2395733">It says nothing about whether another country might choose to adopt a different criminal law system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1180.477" offset="4860020">In the jurisdictions where a claim like this could be raised, courts will have to go through, as they did in this case, several bodies of foreign law and try to make appraisal of the realistic ability of a foreign government to prosecute, and that stands quite a bit in contrast to the domestic regime in which, once the privilege is raised, it stands as an absolute, except that the Government has immunity power, and the immunity power has always been viewed as essentially coextensive with the reach of the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1224.138" offset="5034622">That is certainly true, but the way that the test is applied in the lower courts is not terribly demanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.911" offset="5057715">Normally, if a witness can identify a body of law under which he contends it's conceivable that he might be incriminated, he's not required to go much further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.088" offset="5094390">Courts don't typically take in camera testimony to determine whether the answers would really be incriminating, and they don't typically ask whether the State or Government prosecution that is feared is really likely to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.487" offset="5144023">It's generally enough simply to assert that there is testimony that would incriminate the individual and to identify a law under which that might happen, and the Government's next step is ordinarily immunity if it wants the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.257" offset="5191148">But immunity orders aren't going to work in this context, because we rarely are going to be able to guarantee that the immunity order will actually be coextensive with the scope of the privilege and prevent the use of the testimony overseas and, as a result, we may well be in situations where we're investigating serious terrorist activity, or interstate... international drug trafficking, money laundering, white collar crime, and we are helpless to attain our prosecutorial objectives because an immunity order simply doesn't work.</text>

            <text syncTime="1354.325" offset="5555399">This Court had suggested that there might be an exemption to the traditional dual sovereignty rule under the Double Jeopardy Clause, which allows the States and the Federal Government each to prosecute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1377.412" offset="5647768">It's not that the foreign prosecution is a cover, but that the United States is very eager to assist the foreign prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1385.469" offset="5679951">--I... no, that makes no difference, because the ultimate constitutional question is whether the criminal case in which incrimination is feared is a criminal case within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.527" offset="5720180">Our essential position is that no foreign criminal case fits within the language of the Fifth Amendment, construed in light of its history and its policies and, as a result, it simply doesn't matter that the witness may say, I fear incrimination overseas because the United States may cooperate with a foreign government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.617" offset="5788516">Now, again, the role of immunity statutes here, in our view, is key, because there has never been a time in this country in which a claim of the Fifth Amendment privilege could not be met by the Government seeking to get the testimony through granting immunity, but if this rule proposed by the respondent and accepted by the Second Circuit were adopted, it would mean that the United States would no longer be able to obtain needed testimony and it would put a witness who feared foreign prosecution in a better position than a witness who fears domestic prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1462.489" offset="5987987">The historical fact is that, as the Fifth Amendment right developed in the common law in England, simultaneously it was recognized that testimony could be compelled if immunity was granted and, in the colonies in this country which adopted precursors of the Fifth Amendment privilege, immunity statutes were also enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.592" offset="6064474">Now, the Federal Government didn't get into the business of enacting immunity statutes until about 1857, but I think that's largely explicable by the very small role of the Federal Government in prosecuting criminal cases in the early years of this Nation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1562.722" offset="6388915">It is also anomalous because the Second Circuit's holding would grant a witness greater protection than he might have in the country to which he ultimately goes if he faces prosecution.</text>
