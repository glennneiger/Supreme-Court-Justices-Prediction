            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="150615">We'll hear argument next in Number 97-731, United States v. Beggerly.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.678" offset="185306">Mr. Wolfson.</text>

            <text syncTime="13.831" offset="205890">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.154" offset="219160">In 1982, the United States and about 200 other parties settled complex land litigation by agreeing that the title to the disputed lands would be quieted in the United States and that the defendants would receive substantial sums which they stipulated in the consent judgment were fair and just compensation for their claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.733" offset="293453">Over a decade later, the respondents sought to nullify that settlement agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.258" offset="311634">They contended that public documents in the National Archives showed that the disputed lands on Horn Island had been granted to a private claimant by the Spanish colonial authorities in 1781.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.714" offset="353430">The district court dismissed their challenge to the consent judgment as untimely, and also stated that there was little evidence of fraud or mistake to support their challenge on the merits, but the court of appeals agreed with the respondent that the consent judgment should be set aside, and it also held that the Spanish grant was valid, and it awarded title in the disputed lands to the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.866" offset="433991">The court of appeals decision contravenes important values of finality, repose, and stability in the law which are at their apex in litigation over titles to land, and the lower court's errors also have broad significance for the stability of title to both public and private lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.228" offset="499506">First, the court of appeals disregarded basic principles of finality of judgments and sovereign immunity when it allowed this case to go forward.</text>

            <text syncTime="95.243" offset="531585">Incidentally... and I want you to keep on this vein so far as I'm concerned, but do you have to... in order to prevail, do you have to convince us both of the sovereign immunity point and of the statute of limitations point under the Quiet Title Act?</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="108.732" offset="585502">Well, they both... there are two... I have to turn to the statute of... the QTA, the Quiet Title Act for a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.738" offset="609534">If we win on the sovereign immunity ground, then I think that the quiet title action can't really go anywhere because we would indisputedly have title to the lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.644" offset="657182">That is, there may be a separate question--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="129.298" offset="667735">Well, what if they want to set aside the settlement, or something.</text>

            <text syncTime="131.259" offset="675572">--I don't... my... our position is that the Quiet Title Act would not allow a... would not allow the settlement to be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.623" offset="701067">I mean, if the... let's assume that they could get into district court under the Quiet Title Act because the court of appeals said yes, the statute of limitations was tolled.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.767" offset="729593">Immediately, we would move for summary judgment or to move to dismiss their claim because it's... the judgment held... as a matter of res judicata definitively gave us title, and in the Quiet Title Act, in fact, there's a provision that says that the plaintiff has to set out with particularity the nature of his right title or interest in the disputed lands, as well as the United States, and it would be, I think, a complete defense to any action under the Quiet Title Act that the judgment in the prior action had conclusively found... determined that title were in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.267" offset="851637">Now, that is... it may be a separate question from the statute of limitations question under the Quiet Title Act as to--</text>

            <text syncTime="188.608" offset="905031">Why didn't the Government just say claim preclusion?</text>
            <text syncTime="191.412" offset="916212">We already had a quiet title action.</text>

            <text syncTime="193.693" offset="925302">--Well, I mean, we of course... it has to be understood in the district court the respondents relied on the quiet title action... on the Quiet Title Act not really... they didn't really want title to the land back.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.040" offset="970755">They didn't really want their land back.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.921" offset="974204">They wanted money, and there's various pleadings in the district court in which they say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.097" offset="994997">What they said, Your Honor, was that the Quiet Title Act allowed the district court to award them damages because there is a provision that says if it's found that it's their land but... under the Quiet Title Act, but we elect to keep it anyway, then we can elect to award them compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.756" offset="1061557">Our argument in the district court was that the district court could not use the Quiet Title Act on that basis because it was essentially a taking claim which had to be brought in the Court of Federal Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.513" offset="1104607">Now, we went up to the--</text>

            <text syncTime="244.286" offset="1127699">You say, they acquired it, there was a judgment, it was so many dollars, and that dollar judgment is it.</text>

            <text syncTime="344.446" offset="1528313">I don't... I have to say I don't think we waived it.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.007" offset="1538553">I mean, it wasn't really presented in a way in which we were called upon to address it in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.278" offset="1555689">The respondents did not even amend their cause of... amend their complaint in order to raise a claim under the Quiet Title Act until after they filed for summary judgment, and the district court dismissed it as untimely, which should be reviewed in the court of appeals, I would think, under an abuse of discretion standard, so we strongly feel that we had no call to even address these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.352" offset="1640013">It was only when the court of appeals, even while excusing the respondents for their 12-year delay in bringing their suit, rushed to the, you know, ultimate merits of the case, reopened the judgment, concluded that everything... that the land claim was valid, and awarded title to the respondents, that we had to face the issue about whether the Quiet Title Act could be a basis for awarding the title into the respondents' land.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.060" offset="1738755">I think that that does focus... return me to my point about why the court of appeals' decisions... why its rulings are so important.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.703" offset="1769371">First, I mean, in terms of finality of judgments and sovereign immunity, the court of appeals essentially redetermined land title issues in a litigation against the United States that was a collateral attack on a final judgment where there was no waiver of sovereign immunity that would permit such a case to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.516" offset="1836662">Second, when the court of appeals, on the issue of whether there is tolling of the statute of limitations under the Quiet Title Act, when the court held that it should be tolled, I think it disregarded two very important policies about statute of limitations, both generally in the law and especially with regard to land title litigation: first, protecting parties against being forced to come into court to defend against stale, very stale land claims, and also to encourage plaintiffs who claim an interest in land to conduct prompt and thorough research on their claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.708" offset="1973439">I've spoken third about the court of appeals kind of prematurely judging the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.842" offset="2005936">That, we submit, was error because it was... first of all because it was outside of the scope of the court of appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="470.607" offset="2032999">Is it your position the court of appeals was wrong in saying that the independent action was just really a continuation of the earlier action?</text>

            <text syncTime="482.726" offset="2081482">Certainly an independent action is possible under the rules, isn't it, because it says that--</text>

            <text syncTime="487.531" offset="2100708">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.771" offset="2101648">I mean, I would say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.691" offset="2109276">The rules leave any independent action where they found it.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.806" offset="2129756">That is, they do not... the rules, of course, do not abridge or modify or enlarge any substantive right, and all that... when Rule 60(b) says there may be an independent action, it doesn't purport to create one, or establish what the substantive law would be for proceeding under one.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.515" offset="2192659">All it says is, if, under some other body of substantive law there is available to a party an independent action that would allow that party relief from a final judgment, the rules leave that where... you know, leave that there.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.044" offset="2246785">What the rules themselves do, however, is they eliminated a kind of a borderland of ancillary forms of action that were neither really inside nor exactly outside the original litigation, that were available in the 19th Century, before law and equity were united in the Federal Rules in 1938 and, as we've explained, there was considerable confusion between 1938 and 1946 as to whether still one could go outside the mechanism that the rules had set up, which was to say, to file a motion for relief from judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.679" offset="2397250">The reason why I think there was confusion was that as it was originally enacted, Rule 60(b) did not specifically say that a party could get relief from a final judgment because of fraud, and I think there was some speculation that it couldn't have been that the rules had intended to cut off that avenue from relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.122" offset="2471020">What the--</text>

            <text syncTime="580.672" offset="2473214">--Right on that point, supposing... I know it's not this case, but supposing there had been allegations of fraud here, would there need to be an independent jurisdictional basis for attacking the judgment on fraud grounds?</text>

            <text syncTime="1205.013" offset="4970625">I mean, as we pointed out in our brief, we did bring the fact of the Boudreau grant to the parties' attention in the original litigation and said, presuming this to be for... a grant for Horn Island, we... you know, we believe that it was not valid because it was never recognized by Commissioner Crawford and so it shouldn't be given effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1268.523" offset="5224639">First, as I mentioned earlier, we think that the court of appeals acted outside the scope of appellate jurisdiction under section 1291 when it reached the ultimate issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.432" offset="5268316">Even if we're wrong on the first two questions presented, or even the first one, and even if the judgment of dismissal was incorrect in the case... you know, that dismissal should have been reversed... it seems to me that what the court of appeals should have done was simply remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2340.556" offset="9512796">You hired your own researcher.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.466" offset="9520424">So why did you shift from trusting the Government and saying, well, I'll accept their representation, and then you took their money... you were paid, what, 200,000 some odd dollars... and then there was a great flurry of activity, much investigation on your part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.583" offset="9612897">So why... well, what made you suddenly get into this highly investigative mode when earlier you said, we relied on the United States?</text>

            <text syncTime="2389.479" offset="9708506">The critical point, I believe, so far as the inability to bring this action within 1 year, is that the Beggerlys had looked at archives all around, had hired an archivist to look, had looked in the National Archives, as a matter of fact, had not discovered the grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.070" offset="9782798">As they got to the very end, after they'd done this basic research, and they took the deposition of the Government representative, a man who supposedly knows how to find documents in the National Archives and other repositories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.049" offset="9834729">He said there is no grant in the National Archives, and they had already done an initial look, and so they accepted him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2432.947" offset="9882377">They pursued other means to try to find this, but they didn't go back to the National Archives for some time, and the reason they did not go back there is because... based on this representation that it would be fruitless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.074" offset="9926889">Finally, as a last-ditch effort, they said okay, let's take one more look, and they hired this genealogist who went in and did intensive research over a period of several weeks and found the document.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.442" offset="9980284">But they were directed away from the National Archives as it got to the close of the litigation because of the Government's representation, because they had already deposed the Deputy of that office, who said there may be grants there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.570" offset="10028871">They went in and did their own research and they deposed the ultimate authority, and he said you won't find them there, and so they ceased looking there until they had looked in all the other places possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.739" offset="10081534">And then they went back and said, okay, let's take one last look here and see if we can find it, and they did.</text>

            <text syncTime="3145.007" offset="12730559">Nobody was claiming against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.012" offset="12750622">The Government recognized their title itself and negotiated with them for several years and made offers to them to buy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.877" offset="12778102">Even in the Raleigh Beggerly affidavit, the Government presented him with title opinions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3163.790" offset="12805688">So I do not see any disruption of title, and I might add, Your Honor, that this Court has on more than one occasion reconsidered its interpretation of laws of foreign Governments as well as State Governments based on newly discovered evidence or the fact that the law in that sovereign area, country, has changed by a ruling of its ultimate authorities.</text>
