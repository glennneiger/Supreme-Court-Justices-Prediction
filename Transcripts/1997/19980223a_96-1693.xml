            <text syncTime="34.002" offset="289829">This case presents the question of whether a defendant in a potential capital case has a constitutional right to effectively charge himself with crimes not charged by the prosecution and which are not lesser included offenses of the crimes that were charged by the prosecution, and to have his jury instructed on those offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.744" offset="376765">In Beck v. Alabama, this Court had said... said that if a lesser included offense exists under State law and is supported by the evidence, that an instruction on that lesser included offense must be given at the request of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.785" offset="432980">Here, Respondent Reeves was charged with two counts of felony murder.</text>

            <text syncTime="92.323" offset="523155">Instead, the Respondent asked to have his jury instructed on second degree murder and manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.508" offset="543844">For 100 years, the Nebraska Supreme Court has clearly and consistently held that second degree murder and manslaughter are not lesser included offenses of felony murder in the State of Nebraska.</text>

            <text syncTime="146.364" offset="739344">One is the more general answer that has been given by the Nebraska Supreme Court over the years, which is simply to say that... that there are two different intents involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.876" offset="773304">Under a felony murder, the intent involved looks at the intent to commit the underlying felony.</text>

            <text syncTime="162.233" offset="802770">Under first degree premeditated murder, second degree murder and manslaughter, the focus is on the intent to kill or the intent to commit the murder.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.342" offset="947175">In the case of second degree sexual assault, to answer your question, we need to think about what the purpose of our manslaughter statute is.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.293" offset="979044">And the purpose of the manslaughter statute in the commission... killing in the commission of an unlawful act is that if someone is committing an unlawful act and someone is killed, that... that makes things worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.007" offset="1021885">Well, manslaughter is a class III felony under Nebraska law.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.006" offset="1037872">Second degree sexual assault is also a class III felony under Nebraska law.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.223" offset="1062740">So there would be no... there would never be a case where a prosecutor would... would need to charge manslaughter where you have a second degree sexual assault that you've already proved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1124.445" offset="4651651">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.207" offset="4690626">The ruling of the Eighth Circuit in this case reflects two critical errors of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.190" offset="4706613">First, that a State can never rely on its own law as a basis for denying a lesser offense instruction in a capital case, and, second, that this Court's decisions in Tyson and Enmund are relevant to the question of whether such instructions are constitutionally required under Beck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.340" offset="4763246">As to the first error, this Court's decisions in Hopper and Spaziano made clear that a State may decline to give lesser offense instructions in a capital case based on the application of State law principles, such as the requirement that there be evidence to support the giving of those lesser offense instructions or that the lesser offenses be... be available as a matter of State statute of limitations law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.301" offset="4847047">And it is surely reasonable for State courts to decline to give lesser offense instructions on offenses that are not necessarily included in the charged offenses... what might be called lesser unincluded offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.296" offset="4891037">A requirement... a constitutional requirement that State courts instruct on such offenses would be utterly unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.824" offset="4917160">As this Court's decisions in Dixon and Schmuck have made clear, there is no logical limiting principal upon the idea of instructing juries on lesser unincluded offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.602" offset="4960210">There is no limiting principle, once you get into that form of analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1455.452" offset="5975641">I... I should try to mention one thing about Nebraska law, although I don't profess to expertise in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.966" offset="5993718">I think that there is at least one possible respect... again, I'm speculating, because Nebraska has never confronted this question... in which involuntary act manslaughter might not be a lesser included offense even on an elements test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.945" offset="6041575">If you look at the statute which defines unlawful act manslaughter, it requires... it appears to require that the murder in fact be unintentional rather than... rather than intentional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.004" offset="6085878">If, as there is some suggestion in Nebraska law, that that's an element of the offense, that you can't have an intentional killing that would be an involuntary manslaughter, then they are not greater and lesser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.750" offset="6132794">Because I could commit a felony murder through an intentional killing in the course of a felony that would not be eligible for treatment as an involuntary manslaughter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1580.261" offset="6474894">There are many aspects of capital sentencing that may or may not be... may arise in the sentencing proceedings that the State is not obliged to affirmatively establish at the time of the... the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.177" offset="6522541">And, again, it's important that, even on the broadest reading of Tyson and Enmund, there is no requirement of a showing of actual intent to kill as opposed to a far less demanding culpable state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.033" offset="6569979">So I don't think it's correct to say that there is anything close to a direct tension, leaving aside the procedural differences between the Tyson/Enmund line of cases and the State's approach to the definition of felony murder or its... of lesser grades of homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.120" offset="6630270">But just to complete the thought about Nebraska law and why it may well be the case under Nebraska law that involuntary manslaughter is not a lesser included offense even under an elements test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.022" offset="6665901">In a case cited in Respondent's brief, the AlZubaidy case, which I think is reported at 559, Northwest 2d, the Nebraska Court of Appeals held that in fact there's no such thing as attempted involuntary manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.799" offset="6721072">And when it said that, it said because attempt carries with it the idea that you are intending to commit the offense in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.467" offset="6747717">And involuntary manslaughter has a constituted feature of it that it is an unintentional killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.434" offset="6771540">And that mode of analysis, if applied here, I think would strongly suggest that in fact applying an elements test, that involuntary manslaughter is not a lesser included offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3337.036" offset="13501937">The Nebraska Supreme Court has never explained why 2027 doesn't apply in felony murder cases.</text>
