            <text syncTime="1173.124" offset="4692428">In other words, that's ambiguous, but it's certainly able... and my natural reading is, defendant, you don't have to know that that thing, which you do know is the very thing described in section 5845, you do not have to know the fact that there's a statute called 5845 which makes it illegal to possess it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.296" offset="4773094">Now, that's a natural meaning of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2893.201" offset="11572767">Because we say now, however overwhelming the evidence may have been, however adequate the evidence may have been to convict, despite the fact that the jury certainly, let's say, considered 9 out of the 10 elements clearly, and the instructional error only goes to one element, despite the overwhelming power of the evidence on that element, if we cannot say beyond a reasonable doubt in effect that the jury did find what was necessary, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.360" offset="11697424">It's not a sufficiency of the evidence test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.491" offset="11705887">Why shouldn't a sufficiency of the evidence test be appropriate so long as the evidence is so overwhelming that there's no unfairness in sending someone away with a record like that, and number 2, in reaching whatever verdict the jury did reach, it certainly engaged in a substantial amount of fact-finding, even if there was an error with respect to one element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.658" offset="11798570">Why doesn't each of your central conditions get satisfied on, we'll say, a sufficiency of the evidence test, whereas in normal harmless error review that isn't enough?</text>
