            <text syncTime="9.606" offset="187297">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.391" offset="198477">This case involves the interpretation of the RICO statute and the Federal theft, bribery and embezzlement statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.212" offset="225749">Concerning the Federal bribery statute, this case presents the issue of whether this prosecution in Federal court, of State officials, is within the scope of the statute, even though it does not... the conduct complained of does not impinge upon... upon, affect or divert Federal or even State or even any local funds whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.327" offset="314252">Concerning the RICO statute, this case presents the issue of what are the elements of a RICO conspiracy and how that should be charged to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.183" offset="349674">Because of the nature of the prosecution in this case, State officials being tried for primarily State law violations in Federal court, it raises great issues concerning Federalism and the federalization of State crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.757" offset="407875">As to the Federal bribery statute, it is our position that the statute itself does not reach as far as a prosecution in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.048" offset="445073">Of course, the... the funds which funded the bribery did not involve any State, Federal or local funds; but, more importantly, no Federal funds, no local funds, no State funds, whatsoever, were diverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.622" offset="499408">18 U.S.C., Section 666 contemplates the kind of transaction where, for example, money is embezzled from the government, where there is a theft of government property, or, in the bribery context, where government funds are diverted as a result of the bribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.520" offset="574954">And what I mean by this, for example, is where money is, for example, paid to a government official, and then a... a bid is awarded or a contract is given or a lease is awarded or a grant is made or a job is given, something of that nature.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="125.331" offset="650187">Of course, it's clear the statute would apply in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.797" offset="656038">But are you suggesting there is no Federal interest in how Federal prisoners are treated when they're housed in State facilities?</text>

            <text syncTime="135.653" offset="691460">I am saying that there... I do recognize that there is a Federal interest in how the prisoners are treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.573" offset="719150">And... and I think that could be vindicated probably in a properly worded statute that is directed to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.143" offset="745481">But this statute is not directed to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.245" offset="757916">Additionally, if I may point out, the government's interest is... is probably satisfied if, for example, it makes sure that the grant that it's giving or... or the Federal funds that... that it is awarding are to an organization that, for example, shares it views... shares its views or its policies.</text>

            <text syncTime="171.373" offset="834402">But our... our inquiry, really... we think probably that Congress is the one to decide whether the government's interest is satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.313" offset="870138">So I don't think there's any separate inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2724.059" offset="11045145">First of all, the... the defendant has to be an agent of a local organization.</text>

            <text syncTime="2732.229" offset="11077850">So it may not be that every single employee of every organization is covered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2744.204" offset="11125707">And the other point is that the statute covers... this is in subsection (B)... benefits under a Federal program that covers a variety of forms of Federal assistance, and that... the legislative history and the courts have... have... do point out that there are some purely commercial transactions between the government and, say, somebody who the government buys computers from, just without any kind of Federal programmatic aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.806" offset="11240123">I mean, if the government just goes out into the open market and spends $10,000 for fungible equipment, that's not necessarily ben... that's not benefits under a Federal program or form of Federal assistance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2793.787" offset="11324028">I want to turn at this point to the... the other issue before the Court, which is the RICO conspiracy issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.873" offset="11348374">Our posissue... our position on that issue... excuse me... is... is quite straightforward, which is that the RICO conspiracy provision follows traditional principles of conspiracy law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.229" offset="11389857">And under the traditional principles, the government is not required to prove that the defendant... the conspiracy defendant agreed personally to commit the offense that is the object of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.472" offset="11442833">The government needs to prove only that the conspirators agreed among themselves that the offense would be committed by one or more of them, and that the defendant associated himself with that... with that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.714" offset="11495705">Nothing in the RICO conspiracy statute suggests that Congress intended to depart from this well-settled rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.135" offset="11529455">Congress used, really, a term of art, 1962(D).</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.908" offset="11560489">And that term has a settled common law meaning, and there is no indication in the statute that there are any additional elements of proof.</text>

            <text syncTime="3021.782" offset="12236015">It... the discussion that General Wolfson engaged in with this Court concerning RICO conspiracy, the great debates that went on in Congress concerning the enaction of this statute, the legislative history, all of that was directed to RICO substantive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.897" offset="12336534">RICO substantive, itself, is directed to the heads of the enterprises, the people that manage or control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.134" offset="12357432">Ernst... Reves v. Ernst &amp; Young indicates that... that that's the idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.871" offset="12380420">So it... it just doesn't seem unfair that if you can't get them under RICO substantive, that there's apparently a great discussion in the legislative history that... that would indicate, well, we... we can get them under RICO conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.113" offset="12429321">The... the focus here is, what is the object of the conspiracy?</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.017" offset="12448965">And the object of the conspiracy, in... in our view, is not simply to join an enterprise that... that operates in that fashion, but to... to personally agree to commit two specific acts of racketeering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.692" offset="12515630">That's what the whole discussion in the legislative history was about, not limited RICO substantive or RICO conspiracy... just to when the statute would or would not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.150" offset="12561501">I would suggest to the Court, concerning both of these statutes, Section 666 and... and the RICO statute, that there are certain areas of government which historically this Court has indicated to us, under the Constitution, have been deemed within the province, or primarily within the province, of States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.296" offset="12634121">For example, education, domestic relations, State officials and criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.615" offset="12655333">This case has two of those areas: State officials and criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.484" offset="12670797">And it has been established, in the context of State officials, that before it can be said that Congress intended to reach their conduct or regulate their conduct or affect their status or qualifications of State officers, it must be clear that the officers, under the circumstances of the case, are within the scope of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.481" offset="12750836">And that's the clear statement rule.</text>
