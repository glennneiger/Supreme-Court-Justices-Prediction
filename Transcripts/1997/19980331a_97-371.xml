            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="92.556" offset="521080">--Justice Kennedy, I think that the question of Article III justiciability, which of course must be measured at the time the suit was commenced or, really, in this case at the time that the pre-1990 claims were settled and all that was left in the case was the facial challenge to the 1990 act, is a close one.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.084" offset="595164">In the district court we challenged Article III, the Article III justiciability issue both on the question that these plaintiffs lacked standing and also because, since the agency had adopted an interpretation that basically concluded that the 1990 language was satisfied merely by the creation of extremely diverse panels and that decency and respect were not expressly to be considered as independent factors at the grant-making stage, the agency was in the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.222" offset="719715">Process was in effect no different than it had been before, other than the fact that the diversity of the panels was greater, and therefore our view was that the agency was not doing anything significantly different after the district court ruled than before it ruled, and conversely, if this Court were to agree with our statutory interpretation, the agency would be permitted, although not compelled, to continue to operate the program precisely the way it's operating now.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.575" offset="833087">Now, this was not an issue that we raised on appeal or we raised in our petition in this Court, and I wish I could tell you exactly why that's the case, because I wasn't there, but I suspect that we concluded that there was some marginal concreteness, or some marginal justiciability here by the fact that before... between the time that the 1990 amendment was passed in November of '90 and the time that the district court issues, issued its injunction in June of 1992, we actually read to the panel members the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.848" offset="978223">We then told them that they were to judge applications on the basis of artistic merit and artistic excellence, and that the other words, the words that follow taking into consideration, had been taken into consideration by the creation of extremely diverse panels in which each person from a diverse walk of life would bring his or her own individual sensibilities to that question, and we argued to the district court that, in fact, the case was not justiciability.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.767" offset="1101939">There was no injury and there was no redressability possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.754" offset="1117822">In fact, during the period between the time that the 1990 amendments were passed and the district court ruled, three of the five plaintiffs in this case received grants under the standard that they had concluded was unconstitutional and a fourth had benefited indirectly from a grant given to an organization.</text>
