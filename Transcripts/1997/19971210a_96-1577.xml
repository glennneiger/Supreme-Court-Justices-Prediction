            <text syncTime="905.735" offset="3773192">If they'd elected the other option they would have title just to the surface, and the regional corporation under ANCSA would have title to the subsurface, so they got a great deal more by pursuing that option and, as was explained by the Department of the Interior, when they refused to take the land back in trust, that this was simply another way to calculate your benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="970.576" offset="4032536">Yes, in a technical sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.095" offset="4038701">Sandoval, which involved the Pueblos.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.963" offset="4046120">The Pueblos owned the land in fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.581" offset="4060644">However, in the beginning, when the United States took jurisdiction from the King of Spain, that title has been circumscribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.235" offset="4091259">The statute specified that that land was under the absolute jurisdiction and control of the Congress of the United States, so while they technically have fee title, Congress retains control, and that's the critical element in the establishment of Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.697" offset="4153013">I'm aware of no other case, no case where the Government doesn't have control over the land, which is necessary if they're going to assume the obligation of superintendence with the displacement of State authority, and that's why the Court has emphasized that it's critical to focus on the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.056" offset="4222498">When Indian country is established, the most typical way is by establishing a reservation providing for allotments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.544" offset="4244441">Congress specifically designates the area that's to be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.412" offset="4259906">That is also true with respect to the only two cases outside of the reservation or allotment categories where this Court has found Indian country, Sandoval and McGowan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.352" offset="4299716">In Sandoval, the Court, this Court did not consider a range of factors to see if they added up to some abstract concept of Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.623" offset="4332735">Congress said in the statute, this land is Indian country, land owned by the Pueblos, and so, too, in McGowan, the colony case that Justice Breyer was mentioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.479" offset="4368157">There, Congress set it up owned by the Federal Government, in trust for specific Indians from throughout Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.883" offset="4397832">The respondents would shift to a much more amorphous and more expansive concept of Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.703" offset="4425104">They ask whether the area has a uniquely Indian character, whether it is a distinctly Indian community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.940" offset="4454048">They don't quite bring themselves to adopt the Ninth Circuit's test, which is six factors to be weighed in an amorphous way to come to that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.629" offset="4484768">Those tests, that approach would effectively shift the responsibility for defining and designating Indian country from Congress to the courts.</text>
