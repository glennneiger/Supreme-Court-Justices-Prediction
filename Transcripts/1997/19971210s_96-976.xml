            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87970">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 96976, Hudson against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.382" offset="117436">In this case, during the early and mid 1980's, the Petitioner John Hudson was the chairman and controlling shareholder of the -- of two -- two banks in Western Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.721" offset="158814">During the same period, the two other petitioners in this case were officers of those banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.271" offset="180966">In 1989, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency imposed monetary penalties and occupational debarments on petitioners for violating various federal statutes and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.291" offset="229031">When the Government later criminally indicted petitioners for essentially the same conduct, they moved to dismiss the indictments on double jeopardy grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.739" offset="262886">The District Court ultimately agreed with them but the Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.315" offset="277201">It held that under our decision in the case called United States against Halper, the actual fines imposed by the Government were not grossly proportional -- disproportional.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.621" offset="326416">In an opinion filed with the clerk of the Court today, we -- we affirm that judgment but for different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.894" offset="351493">The Double Jeopardy Clause provides that no person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice putting jeopardy of life or limb.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.001" offset="383885">We have long held that this clause protects only against the imposition of multiple criminal punishments for the same offense and then only when such occurs in successive proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.697" offset="426726">Our opinion in United States against Halper, marked the first time we applied the Double Jeopardy Clause to a sanction without first determining that it was criminal in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.637" offset="466432">We believe that Halper's deviation from longstanding double jeopardy principles was ill-considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.447" offset="497674">Its test for determining whether a particular sanction is subject to the strictures that Double Jeopardy Clause has proved unworkable and other constitutional provisions addressed many of the ills at which Halper was directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.224" offset="552845">Thus, we today, disavowed the method of analysis he used in Halper and reaffirm that traditional double jeopardy rule exemplified in our opinion in United States against Ward, a case decided in 1980, applying traditional double jeopardy principles to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.534" offset="618047">It is clear that the criminal prosecution of these petitioners would not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.255" offset="640930">Congress intended the OCC money penalties and debarments to be civil in nature and there is little evidence to say nothing of the clearest proof required by Ward that these OCC monetary penalties and debarment sanctions are criminal despite Congress's intention to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.654" offset="710520">The Double Jeopardy Clause is therefore no obstacle to the trial of petitioners on the pending indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.014" offset="736016">Justice Scalia has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Thomas has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.496" offset="753883">Justice Stevens and Justice Souter filed opinions concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.646" offset="770497">Justice Breyer has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justice Ginsburg has joined.</text>
