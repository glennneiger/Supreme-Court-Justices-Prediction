I found about, like 11 or 12 of them anyway that seem to say, your rights are restored automatically, they're never taken away, as soon as you get out of prison, and by the way, you can have guns, so there, I guess, there is no such law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1474.358" offset="6028454">The inquiry under section 921(a)(20) turns on whether a State has restored a felon's civil rights and, if so, whether it has continued to impose restrictions on his firearms possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.959" offset="6082789">If that is the case, then the conviction remains a conviction with respect to any firearms that the felon may possess in the present.</text>

            <text syncTime="1552.612" offset="6341401">For example, in this case petitioner has prior convictions in California and also under Federal law, so no matter what Massachusetts does to restore his civil rights for his Massachusetts convictions, and no matter what Massachusetts says with respect to his firearms privileges, he still remains a felon in possession for purposes of Federal law.</text>
