            <text syncTime="273.404" offset="1241738">We take the position that you have to meet the definition, and the reason the issue is raised in a case like this is because this particular individual is a classic example of a person who had no symptoms, no difficulties whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="319.826" offset="1427417">And we escape from that argument, we believe successfully, by the fact that Congress already narrowed that definition to what's in the regulation, and I say Congress narrowed it to what's in the regulation because they adopted the language, major life activities, from the 1973 act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the 1988 Fair Housing Amendments Act, so it was already in place that major life activities is limited to functions such as living, breathing, working.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.582" offset="1526473">When we get to that, the question then becomes is reproduction on that list of major life activities, and the reason it isn't is precisely for the reason I think you made inquiry with respect to, Your Honor, and that is, you have to look at the context and purposes of the Americans With Disabilities Act in order to determine what goes on that list, and the context and purposes are, day to day independent living and economic self sufficiency.</text>

            <text syncTime="1541.458" offset="6313882">The problem of discrimination against individuals with HIV was squarely before Congress when it enacted the ADA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.123" offset="6344602">And the committee reports reflect a concern that unless there were clear protections against discrimination for all individuals with HIV, people with HIV would hide their condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.092" offset="6392458">As the First Circuit correctly found, Sidney Abbott, a woman infected with the virus that causes AIDS has a disability within the meaning of the ADA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.637" offset="6430597">And this Court can affirm the First Circuit's decision on three alternative grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.071" offset="6456406">First of all, this Court can affirm the First Circuit if it finds that reproduction is a major life activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.846" offset="6475528">In addition, the Court can affirm the First Circuit if it finds, as reflected in the committee reports and as the First Circuit also noted in its decision, that everybody with HIV, a fatal, contagious, incurable disease, is substantially limited in many different major life activities.</text>
