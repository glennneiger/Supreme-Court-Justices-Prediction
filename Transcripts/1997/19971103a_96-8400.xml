            <text syncTime="62.571" offset="403061">Douglas Buchanan was sentenced to death by a jury entirely uninstructed as to those fundamental Eighth Amendment principles which could have saved his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.139" offset="445275">Indeed, neither the word mitigation, or anything related to mitigation, ever crossed the judge's lips.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.525" offset="478816">There are only a couple of Virginia inmates who, like Douglas Buchanan, have been sentenced to death and have preserved challenges to the absence of mitigation instructions.</text>

            <text syncTime="108.863" offset="588217">There is now recently, as of about 1993, a Virginia model jury instruction which is more expansive and has a definition of mitigation in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.619" offset="631267">It came about from a case called Stewart v. Commonwealth in which the trial judge gave an expansive mitigation instruction, and the Virginia supreme court did not rule on whether that instruction was proper because it had been given.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.099" offset="697200">It did say that a further instruction, which was really not very much more expansive, would have been duplicative of what was given, but the model jury instructions now have that... the instruction from Stewart in the book.</text>

California, in which the question is whether or not the instructions are expansive enough to allow for consideration of all of the mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.770" offset="1119861">Here, there's an instruction that violates Gregg in that it provides absolutely no guidance and doesn't discuss mitigation at all, and at the same time... but at the same time violates Lockett, because what the judge... what the trial judge says is, I will instruct you as to what the law is that you should consider.</text>

            <text syncTime="319.582" offset="1431136">Instead of saying, if after considering all of the evidence you may determine that death is not justified, if he had said, after considering all the evidence, including such evidence as you find to be in mitigation, that the death penalty is not justified, would that pass muster?</text>

            <text syncTime="344.648" offset="1531342">The baseline at best is the instruction that's set forth in the footnote of the first Zant opinion, which although the Court didn't rule on it, has significantly more about mitigation than exists here.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.048" offset="1588916">That is, the judge contrasted it with aggravation.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.581" offset="1603126">The judge talked about it in terms of mitigation or extenuation.</text>

            <text syncTime="372.519" offset="1642832">But what you're saying is, essentially four words were missing.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.920" offset="1660387">After the words telling the jury that they were to consider all the evidence, if the judge had said, including the mitigating evidence, those four words, that would have brought it within the constitutional zone?</text>

            <text syncTime="392.761" offset="1723812">The other level is that in Virginia, unlike in Georgia, which was the subject of the decision in Zant, the General Assembly has set forth a specific list of mitigating factors, and that those factors are, under the decisions in Gregg and the decision in Ramos, the factors that the State, representing organized society, believes are most relevant to the sentencing decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.150" offset="1825376">If I were a trial judge I'd be worried about specifically reciting mitigating factors lest a defense attorney come before an appellate court and say, the jury got the impression that these were the only mitigating.</text>

            <text syncTime="433.687" offset="1887548">The problem is solved first of all in every State, because every State has found it perfectly able to define mitigating circumstances, including statutory circumstances, and still have a catch all that avoids that, but in this particular case, Justice Scalia, the defense attorneys proposed a jury instruction that said that this was not an exclusive list, and that they could consider any other facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="459.884" offset="1992246">I mean, you are now arguing for more, but I think when I asked you, suppose those four words had been included, including the mitigating evidence without a laundry list, that that would have been enough to satisfy the constitutional requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="477.466" offset="2062672">One is in terms of the general instruction that is correct, but that where, as in Virginia, you do have a declaration of the relevant mitigating evidence, which we have, unlike in Georgia, then that also should be part of the equation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1556.186" offset="6377474">"then that is a fact which mitigates against imposing the death penalty. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3232.444" offset="13082584">It was raised in the Virginia courts throughout, and the Virginia court in the State habeas proceeding ruled that when we raised it, we were raising the same claim that had been raised on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.079" offset="13121037">They applied the rule of the case Hawks v. Cox, which is that we dealt with this on direct appeal, it was raised, it's preserved, and in that we raised all... the failure to mention mitigation and all of those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.868" offset="13164191">So that's come up all along, and in the cert petition at pages 19 to 20 we raised... the issue that we talked about was the failure to do anything in reference to mitigation, so that issue has in fact been put before every court that's looked at it, and the Virginia supreme court recognized when it came up on State habeas that it was exactly the same thing that had been presented before, and the same issue was presented.</text>
