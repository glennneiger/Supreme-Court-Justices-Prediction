            <text syncTime="9.377" offset="37407">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:--</text>
            <text syncTime="13.460" offset="53812">In September 1992 the State of Missouri revoked Randy Spencer's parole on the basis of the Board of Probation and Parole's finding that he had committed forcible rape, armed criminal action, and possession of crack cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.428" offset="109610">After exhausting his State remedies, Spencer filed a Federal habeas corpus action asserting Federal constitutional violations concerning this revocation which would, if recognized, have required the court to hold it invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.569" offset="170214">About 4 months after Spencer filed his petition, the State released him on parole again for good behavior, but without expunging the order of revocation or abandoning its finding that he was guilty of these three serious felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.600" offset="230400">Nearly 2-1/2 years after he filed his petition, the district court dismissed it as moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.293" offset="261120">In conflict with the decisions of every other United States court of appeals that had then issued a published opinion dealing with the subject, the court below affirmed the district court's dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.433" offset="313678">An official governmental finding that one is guilty of forcible rape, armed criminal action, and possession of crack cocaine has collateral consequences like those of a criminal conviction per se.</text>

            <text syncTime="92.982" offset="371879">I thought that if you're convicted of a crime, A, then under the guidelines in many States when you're convicted of crime B your sentence automatically goes up, and I thought that wasn't true here, that if your parole is revoked there is no guideline or statute that says you get an increased sentence because of a parole revocation, though of course they could give you an increased sentence on the basis of that for which the parole was revoked.</text>

            <text syncTime="150.130" offset="600503">In other words, the defendant would always have a chance to say, but I didn't do this thing, I didn't commit... I didn't do that for which, and then the parole board or whoever, the court would consider, did he do it or didn't he do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.491" offset="1321900">The question is what the Court held in Lane and in Evitts, rather than the typography of where the points appeared and in Lane, the question that my client is asking the Court to decide, this wasn't before the Court, because in Lane the prisoners did not argue that the State of Illinois had violated their Federal constitutional rights as explained in Morrissey and Gagnon.</text>

            <text syncTime="358.398" offset="1433496">I know the language is there, but not only were the facts different in Lane and the procedural posture was different, but Lane predated Evitts' addition of sentence enhancement and testimonial impeachment to the list of collateral consequences and, furthermore, one of the things the Court relied on in Lane, as far as the reader can tell, is the speculative nature of what was going to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.476" offset="1541851">And it's my position, Your Honor, that the consequences of that, of a parole revocation, especially a serious one like this, one sex offense, one weapons offense, one drug offense, the consequences of these are far more powerful--</text>

            <text syncTime="416.255" offset="1664940">If the Court goes on a case by case basis and just says, well, in this case it's forcible rape, armed criminal action, and possession of crack cocaine, well, we're going to hold that it's not moot, if the Court feels that that would be unmanageable because courts would have to decide it on a case by case basis, the Court could apply the Sibron presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.039" offset="1744144">My client wins either way because of the grossly stigmatic characteristics of the felonies that he's been found guilty of without a trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="458.425" offset="1833691">I would suppose that the stigma that you refer to would be far more powerful at the point of a subsequent decision to parole in the first place, and yet that does not seem to be your concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.493" offset="1889907">Why does the stigma become greater when he has been paroled and the question is, will parole be revoked, than it was, or seems to be on your calculus, at the point at which he would be subject to parole?</text>

            <text syncTime="1530.990" offset="6123938">After Sibron, Lane, and the footnote in Evitts, we might be able to divide collateral consequences that are alleged to defeat mootness into three categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.395" offset="6157479">The first are those that are current civil disabilities, those that led to the decision in Sibron... can't vote, can't serve on a jury, those kinds of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.081" offset="6196245">A second category are the ones that were addressed in Lane, things that are discretionary that we can't know now, for example, whether a past parole revocation may have some impact on a future parole request, or, to take that to its ultimate, where the Ninth Circuit has said that perhaps a sufficient collateral consequence is how this revocation might affect someone's chances of employment in the future.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1570.333" offset="6281300">Mr. Layton, maybe I misremember Sibron, but I thought, unlike the first case, Carafas, or whatever, which dealt with only present disability, Sibron did speak about future problems as a result of the conviction, like being impeached as a witness.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_r_layton" startTime="1589.126" stopTime="1770.774">
            <label>Mr. James R. Layton</label>
            <text syncTime="1589.126" offset="6356428">It did speak of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.886" offset="6363533">However, all of the precedents that Sibron cited to support the premise that it could draw a line beyond which there is a presumption against mootness were felony cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.712" offset="6398746">Every one of those is a case that involves current civil disability, so Sibron is not clear as to what it means in terms of what kind of disability today would be sufficient, but the tenor of Sibron is there is a conviction, and in our society we presume when there is a conviction that there are some effects today, as opposed to other kinds of things that may happen to someone as a result of our judicial system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.502" offset="6501982">A third category of alleged collateral consequences are those that are contingent on some future event, although they may not be discretionary after the contingency occurs, and that leads us to the question of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines that Justice Breyer was asking about at the beginning of Mr. Simon's presentation, and that are addressed for the first time in this respect in the reply brief on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.155" offset="6592575">There is in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines a provision that says, we will give points in criminal history for all of the convictions where the incarceration comes within the last 15 years, and by revoking Mr. Spencer's parole, Mr. Spencer... the time of Mr. Spencer's conviction or his incarceration was extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.050" offset="6680137">So if Mr. Spencer is convicted of a crime between April 16, 2007 and August 7, 2008, then the Federal Guidelines would be affected by this parole revocation, but not otherwise, and I think that shows the difficult position that Mr. Spencer asks this Court to take, that we assume that it is enough to defeat mootness today that he may commit a crime during a relatively brief period in the next century, and yet that's the position that he's taken, that the Ninth Circuit has taken, that that kind of sentence enhancement is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.455" offset="6829767">The consequences Mr. Spencer alleges fall within three general categories, that it may affect a future parole decision... what was addressed in Lane, and which is an entirely discretionary decision under Missouri law... whether it would affect him at trial through impeachment or perhaps a presentation of evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 413, or whether it would affect his sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.616" offset="6910433">And then comes the question of the 1983 action, which doesn't really fit in any of these categories of collateral consequences, because his loss of a 1983 claim is not the result of the parole revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.826" offset="6963304">It's not the result of the hearing about which he complains.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.227" offset="6976888">It's the result of his failure to obtain a successful decision in his habeas, or a State or a Federal habeas, and I think there are three reasons why the Court should resist the urge of Mr. Spencer to adopt the position that a 1983 claim, or a loss of the 1983 claim would be enough to defeat mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.719" offset="7050867">The first is that it is too far removed from the question at hand, which is the parole revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.303" offset="7073123">The second is that--</text>

            <text syncTime="1787.026" offset="7148042">You have to go three tiers in the State and then go into the Federal, so these things are bound to be moot, aren't they, because even... you're talking here about district court delay, but that wouldn't be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.713" offset="7194749">You'd have to go... Lane didn't become moot till it was in this Court, right?</text>

            <text syncTime="1818.097" offset="7272385">Let's suppose that his State remedies were not exhausted until the day after he was reparoled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.599" offset="7290358">He wouldn't have a 1983 claim, not because of anything the State had done, but because it just took a while for that process to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.615" offset="7318361">And yet he suggests here the Court ought to announce a new rule that because of the timing of his case, somehow, if we have a 1983 claim it will be lost, the case is no longer moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.749" offset="7358903">Now, one of the things that that does is, it would... to adopt that would endorse the position that Mr. Spencer can come before this Court and raise that issue for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.776" offset="7395056">In his brief he wonders how the Eighth Circuit, with its own precedent of Leonard v. Nix, could have reached the decision that it did, given the... a loss of a 1983 cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.293" offset="7441136">Well, the reason is because he never raised the question of a 1983 cause of action in the Eighth Circuit, and so for this Court to adopt that would be to endorse the premise that all of these collateral consequences save one, which were raised for the first time in this Court... in fact, for the first time generally in the reply to the cert petition... that that's the way that someone should operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.168" offset="7528594">You can do these things late.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.468" offset="7533819">I think the third reason why the Court should not adopt the premise that a 198... loss of a 1983 cause of action is sufficient to prevent mootness is that that would in effect move the Sibron presumption from just covering habeas petitions that challenge convictions to covering essentially all habeas petitions, because what habeas petitioner, if the Court were to so rule, is going to resist the urge to say, oh, I have a 1983 cause of action, and so, judge, you can't dismiss my case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2548.054" offset="10192144">Now, it may be that we would be in a different situation if we were in a State such as, I believe New Hampshire, where after you've been revoked once, you never can get parole again, but we aren't in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.282" offset="10233104">All of these kind of disabilities or consequences that we're talking about are remote and contingent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2656.815" offset="10627239">--That may be, plus the Minnesota statute said that a conviction after a successful probation, although not a conviction for future purposes, can be used in calculating a criminal history category under Minnesota law, but there's nothing in that decision to suggest that the same would be true even under Minnesota law for a parole revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.869" offset="10707383">Again, it addresses a conviction and not a parole revocation, and that becomes a critical distinction as long as we attach to convictions certain mandatory civil disabilities or consequences.</text>

            <text syncTime="2702.935" offset="10811664">First, I would like to say that the petitioner agrees with the respondent that the question here is statutory and not constitutional, that it's well established in the decisions of this Court, acquiesced in by years of congressional revision, coupled with inaction, that a person must be in custody when he or she files a petition but that once that is filed, the court may reach the merits of that after they have been released or even completely discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.008" offset="10943948">In respect to the Minnesota decision, members of the court, the petitioner owns that decision and did not feel a need to cite it with specificity by virtue of a reference I believe I made in the reply brief to the cases relied on by the amici.</text>

            <text syncTime="2759.011" offset="11036003">But you didn't cite it, so that suggested to me you didn't think it was... if it was in your favor, that it was strongly in your favor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2766.415" offset="11065574">I'm sorry if I didn't cite it expressly, Your Honor, but we would own it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.540" offset="11086158">Now, it would allow... it referred to use of adjudications in future proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.275" offset="11117087">It was rather broad, but we do see it as buttressing our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.018" offset="11132029">Now, with respect to the petitioner's denial of his drug use, I would refer the Court to pages 89 and 90 of the joint appendix, paragraphs 33 and 34.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.733" offset="11174870">These are not written with great articulateness, but I interpret these as denying the drug use and disagreeing with the interviewing officer to the effect that the petitioner had admitted the drug use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.693" offset="11226697">So we have hearsay within hearsay from the parole officer saying that the petitioner admitted the drug use.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="2816.588" offset="11266299">You're not saying that wouldn't be admissible in a revocation hearing, are you?</text>

            <text syncTime="2821.674" offset="11286674">--Mr. Chief Justice, hearsay is, of course, admissible in parole revocation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.176" offset="11304647">We don't deny it, but that illustrates the slender thread on which this revocation hangs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.983" offset="11347905">Now, the respondents have presented many arguments about how this parole revocation isn't very serious, how this parole revocation for forcible rape, armed criminal action, and possession of crack cocaine isn't very serious, and on some of them I have to agree that they've scored on some of these points in respect to this particular petitioner, and I'm not telling this Court that every single reason why a criminal conviction remains live after release applies to a parole revocation, at least as to Randy Spencer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.265" offset="11484996">But if one looks at the big picture, it is just absolutely unrealistic, bordering on disingenuous, to say that a parole revocation by the State of Missouri for three serious felonies doesn't matter, that it doesn't give the person affected by it a substantial stake, that gives him the incentive to litigate it zealously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.732" offset="11582903">In Missouri we like to ask questions on voir dire, if there's any member of the panel that does not have common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.224" offset="11608816">No one raises their hands, and so you say, well, Judge Bandry is going to instruct you in a few minutes, that you just need to apply your common sense in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.303" offset="11645179">I think that if the Court looks at the damage that this does to this man's future in terms of testimonial impeachment--</text>
