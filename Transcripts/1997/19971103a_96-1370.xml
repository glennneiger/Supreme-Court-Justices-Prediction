            <text syncTime="17.093" offset="210711">This case involves an interpretation of the preference provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, found at 11 U.S.C. section 547.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.037" offset="242476">That is on pages 1 through 5 of petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.820" offset="257627">The issue in a nutshell is whether or not the petitioner, Fidelity Financial Services, timely perfected its lien so as to qualify for the enabling loan exception provided in 547(c)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="44.680" offset="321053">It is undisputed that Fidelity satisfied all the requirements of 11 U.S.C. section 547 (c)(3), subsection (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="54.737" offset="361281">The only other requirement is set forth in subsection (B).</text>
            <text syncTime="59.002" offset="378313">That states that the security interest must be perfected on or before 20 days after the debtor receives possession of such property, meaning the financed property.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.138" offset="422826">When a transfer is perfected is defined by the Bankruptcy Code at section 547(e)(1)(B).</text>
            <text syncTime="78.853" offset="457725">That states that a transfer of an interest in property other than real property is perfected when a creditor on a simple contract cannot obtain a judicial lien which is superior to the interest of the transferee.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.201" offset="511119">That determination must in turn be made by reference to State law, in this case Missouri State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.017" offset="546437">Missouri has a statute... it's been on the books since 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.469" offset="568171">It's found at 301.600 Revised Statutes of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.743" offset="585307">It states that a lien on a motor vehicle or a trailer is perfected as of the time of its creation if certain steps are taken within 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.517" offset="616341">It is undisputed that Fidelity satisfied all of the requirements of this State statute within 21 days at the earliest, 26 days at the latest.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="127.614" offset="652808">So it satisfied the requirement of Missouri law, as you said, but it did not do it within 20 days.</text>

            <text syncTime="142.783" offset="713412">However, under Missouri State law... that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.507" offset="724383">Under Missouri State law, if the lien is perfected within 30 days it is deemed perfected as of the time of its creation.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.951" offset="754163">Therefore, under those circumstances there would be no transfer for or on account of an antecedent debt under section 547(b)(2), or, alternatively, the creditor could raise the enabling loan shield under 547(c)(3).</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael P. Gaughan</label>
            <text syncTime="177.407" offset="851965">Of course, Congress also included the 547(e)(1)(B) section, which incorporates State law, in defining when a transfer is perfected, and for preference purposes, of course, when a transfer occurs is when it is perfected, when it's made, and that incorporates State law, so State law is implicit in that consideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2616.142" offset="10606924">Congress realized there was a problem, that sometimes there could be a delay with enabling loan creditors, so it gave them an extra 10 days, for a total of 20, and said, you know, in every circumstance this may not be enough, but this is the balance we're going to strike between the State interest and the Federal uniform interest in a uniform bankruptcy law and said, 20 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.575" offset="10688635">And it may be true that a 1-day delay in this case doesn't seriously threaten the antisecret lien policy.</text>
