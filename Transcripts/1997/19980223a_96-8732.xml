            <text syncTime="41.049" offset="312249">First, Congress required the jury to determine the type of drug involved in the drug conspiracy before sentence could be imposed upon that object.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.193" offset="348821">Second, the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to a jury determination of all the essential elements of a conspiracy requires the jury to determine what the object of the offense was, and particular to the type of drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.943" offset="403783">Third, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not permit punishment to be imposed in excess of the statutory maximum provided by Congress and, finally, nothing in the Sentencing Guidelines, to the extent that they ever could, undermines these principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.145" offset="476612">With respect to what Congress intended, it's clear that in enacting section 846 Congress wanted to fix the maximum punishment available to a person convicted of that section to the offense, the object of which the conspiracy was intending to accomplish.</text>

            <text syncTime="126.045" offset="652259">Congress made it explicitly clear in enacting section 851 that the existence of a prior conviction was one of the factors listed in 841(b) that should not be considered by the jury, and it did so by removing it from the jury's consideration, placing it in a separate statutory provision, and saying that the judge should make that determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="199.895" offset="947652">First, Congress could well have intended that a conspiracy to commit a specific objective, which is an inchoate offense which does not require the completion of the object of the conspiracy and has separate elements from an 841(a) conspiracy to embrace a more specific object than would, say, an ordinary 841(a)(1) violation of possession, or a distribution.</text>

            <text syncTime="232.907" offset="1079623">A conspiracy offense under 846 is an inchoate offense and therefore the only two elements that the Government need satisfy beyond a reasonable doubt for an 846 offense is that a conspiracy with a particular objective exists and that a particular defendant that was being considered by the jury be a member of that conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.920" offset="1167707">In many conspiracies there are no actual drugs involved, very typically, in the case in which the agents pose as the sellers of drugs and they engage in negotiations and discussions with respective buyers and then a seizure or a bust takes place, an arrest at a planned exchange of drugs for money, and there is, in fact no actual controlled substance.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.159" offset="1352654">That's what Congress expressly says in section 846, punish persons who agree to commit a very specific object as if they had committed that object, and in the case of the type of drug, that specific... excuse me.</text>

            <text syncTime="1429.914" offset="5867658">If they had been considered to have the same statutory maximum as petitioner Fort, who had a life maximum, then it would be very significant to know that, even if there was an upward departure granted in this case, it would not exceed 20 years and risk, you know, possibly a life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.475" offset="5941951">And so under McMillan, the reason... one of the reasons we say that this is an essential element of the offense is because it not only alters the range, but it alters the statutory maximum penalty.</text>
