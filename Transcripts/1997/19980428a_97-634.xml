I wanted to clear up one thing Mr. Tufano said, is that... or, Justice Ginsburg, you hinted at, is the State boot camp statute which establishes the boot camp, establishes it and defines it, describes this as a program itself, so we believe that it's very clear that program, service, or activity basically covers anything that a State agency does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.989" offset="10118830">The words program and activity were statutorily defined by the Rehabilitation Act to cover all of the operations of a prison, and those words were taken from the Rehabilitation Act and put into the ADA so Congress would ensure that they would have the same meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.192" offset="10203572">We believe that the universal language of the statute, its foundation in the Rehabilitation Act, and the regulations which cover prisons, which were expressly incorporated into the act, make it plain that there is no statutory exception for prisoners, which is what the State is arguing for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.657" offset="10293433">We do not believe, and we don't think it would be... we think it would be an impossible burden for the... for Congress to have to list every single entity which it wanted to cover.</text>

            <text syncTime="2815.261" offset="11403846">The court of appeals correctly held that the ADA prohibits State prisons from discriminating against disabled inmates in their programs, services, and activities that they provide to inmates for three reasons:</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.511" offset="11456822">First, the text of the act unambiguously prohibits such discrimination, second, the application of the ADA to prisons was a logical... State prisons was a logical extension of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act's application to Federal prisons and to State prisons that receive Federal funding, and third, the interpretive principles that are relied on by petitioner do not support the creation of a nontextually based exemption to the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.533" offset="11589002">Beginning with the text, the act applies to any public entity that provides programs, services, or activities and, since the act defines a public entity to include any agency or department to a State, the State Department of Corrections is clearly covered.</text>

Davis not to require accommodations that impose undue burdens and not to require accommodations that would lead to a fundamental alteration in the program, which in that case included lowering standards and substantially modifying a nursing program, and second of all you would look to a general principle that this Court has applied in section 504(2), to deferring to the reasonable medical judgments of health professionals.</text>
