            <text syncTime="11.530" offset="203379">Mr. Stein.</text>

            <text syncTime="13.280" offset="210380">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.303" offset="222501">This case involves the 60-day notice period in the citizens provision of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, and whether that period is intended to operate as a cure, thereby obviating a citizen's suit, or whether citizens may sue for wholly past violations even after cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.613" offset="299719">As found by this Court in Gwaltney v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, and again in Hallstrom v. Tillamook County, the overriding congressional purpose of environmental citizen provisions is to prompt compliance with environmental laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.064" offset="353531">Litigation ought to be used as a last resort, when other methods have failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.695" offset="372026">On receiving a 60-day notice under EPCRA, the Steel Company, a small manufacturing company, came into complete compliance, filing the 15 forms required, all within the cure period.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.893" offset="420822">The respondent, Citizens for a Better Environment, sued anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.787" offset="436391">They alleged no current or ongoing violations.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="73.530" offset="451333">Let me ask you a question, please, if I may, Mr. Stein.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.612" offset="467738">What if it were the EPA that were coming in asking for penalties to be imposed after the fact of a cure, so to speak, after the forms were actually filed, but the EPA then comes in and says, well, they should have been filed on X date and they weren't, and they've now filed them, but we want a penalty for every day of the nonfiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.759" offset="576303">Under the statutory scheme, is that permissible?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="107.082" stopTime="118.070">
            <label>Mr. Sanford M. Stein</label>
            <text syncTime="107.082" offset="585603">Yes, Justice O'Connor, under our reading of the statute the EPA's enforcement policy comes under section 325 of the statute, a wholly different section than section 326, the citizen provision.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="118.070" stopTime="142.726">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="118.070" offset="629488">Well, the citizen's suit provision I suppose is designed to be a sort of private attorneys general approach, and to let citizens pick up the slack if the EPA doesn't do it, and is there any reason why the citizens suit shouldn't have the same authority, then, to come in and seek a penalty for the failure to file on time?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="142.726" stopTime="237.762">
            <label>Mr. Sanford M. Stein</label>
            <text syncTime="142.726" offset="728127">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.508" offset="731261">Several reasons, as we see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.770" offset="736277">First of all, section 326 is far more limited, giving citizens a more limited enforcement and assistance role than the EPA's authority under section 325.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.497" offset="775252">In the citizen provision, a citizen may commence a suit upon the failure to complete or submit the forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.972" offset="801165">The Sixth Circuit, in analyzing the same language in the United Musical case, found that it was the failure that Congress was looking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.905" offset="824884">EPA's authority is far broader than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.346" offset="834602">Also, section 326(c) of the statute specifically points out that citizens are able to invoke the court's jurisdiction in the evidence of an enforcement or an injunctive remedy, and then at that time the court can apply penalties if it has jurisdiction through 326, section 326(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="186.878" offset="904715">In that respect, the citizen provision of EPCRA is very similar to the citizen provision of the Clean Water Act that this Court analyzed in Gwaltney.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.934" offset="933031">In Gwaltney, the Court found many reasons to find that Congress did not expect... intend citizens to sue for wholly past violations, but one of the most convincing was section 505(a) of the Clean Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.200" offset="978066">There, also, the Court found that before a citizen could invoke the court's jurisdiction it had... there had to be some kind of injunctive or abatement remedy that it was seeking and then, and only then, would the Court be willing to address penalties relative to a citizens' action.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.770" offset="1036372">Beyond that, and further answering, we think that if... even if the court below were somehow correct that they can seek wholly past violations, we think it fails the Article III standing test because on that date any injury that would befall a citizen had been fully cured.</text>

            <text syncTime="952.488" offset="3967206">Mr. Stein, may I ask you this question: one of the arguments that is being made here is that if standing is not found, with the opportunity to go forward with penalties and, of course, get counsel fees and investigatory fees and so on as a result of that, no one is going to have really an incentive... no citizen is going to have an incentive ever to commence one of these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.013" offset="4061351">My question... with that in mind my question is this: is there any requirement that when a citizens organization starts the 60-day period running it must then have concluded that it can prove a case, or could a citizens group simply come forward and say, we don't know of any reason why this particular company should not have been filing these reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.104" offset="4173678">It looks to us as thought they're covered by the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1013.109" offset="4209727">In that latter instance if, at the end of 60 days, there hadn't been any compliance, then at that point the citizens organization could decide whether to go ahead and in effect make an investment in legal fees and investigatory fees to see whether it would really be worthwhile to bring action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1035.135" offset="4297812">Can they simply put them on notice, as it were, on the basis of a good faith claim that they ought to be filing, or is there some requirement in the statute or regulations to the effect that they must in effect be ready to establish probable cause, or some such thing, for a violation before they even give the notice that starts the 60 days running?</text>
