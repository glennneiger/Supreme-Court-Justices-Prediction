            <text syncTime="77.157" offset="462604">In this case, Deputy Prosecutor Lynne Kalina reviewed and professionally evaluated a completed police report, determined that a burglary charge would be filed, and then prepared and filed an Information, a motion requesting the issuance of an arrest warrant, and a certification which summarized the evidence for the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.852" offset="549435">In Imbler, Buckley, and Burns, this Court set forth a workable approach to determine which functions of a prosecutor are entitled to absolute immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="793.585" offset="3328342">The issue, I guess... one way to put the issue here is, how do we characterize this function of providing the certification?</text>

            <text syncTime="818.685" offset="3428756">If we characterize it in the narrow sense, merely providing, in effect, evidence under oath, then there doesn't seem to be anything peculiar about that function to prosecutors.</text>

            <text syncTime="832.540" offset="3484136">If we characterize it in the broad sense and say, oh, it's just a part of initiating a prosecution, then we're talking about a function that prosecutors do and that prosecutors, generally speaking, get absolute immunity for, and it seems to me that when we ask you the question, how do you characterize, you shift back and forth, and I don't think we... I mean, we really can't shift back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.573" offset="3608270">I would have thought that the reason for characterizing it narrowly was the Malley case.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.509" offset="3636064">In the Malley case, generally speaking it's prosecutors that get search warrants, but witnesses who come forward to provide evidence for those search warrants don't get absolute immunity, and I would have thought that there was an analogy there to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.018" offset="3698026">Prosecutors get arrest warrants, but prosecutors don't necessarily provide evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.719" offset="3720910">So it would have seemed to me that the Malley case was a reason to characterize the function narrowly as presenting evidence, as opposed to characterizing the function broadly as just a little part of going after or getting a search warrant and starting a prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.868" offset="3793426">Is my argument wrong about the application of Malley in deciding whether you take the narrow view or the broad view?</text>

            <text syncTime="1831.167" offset="7478676">There's also the question of whether it was private or a public prosecutorial decision that was being made.</text>

            <text syncTime="1889.785" offset="7713151">And one of the reasons it's critical is, again, unlike the police officer in Malley v. Briggs, a prosecutor in this context is going to have ongoing responsibilities in the case and ongoing duties that will be supervised and protected by the court, and the defendant will also have those protections.</text>

            <text syncTime="1956.366" offset="7979496">Let me begin by answering a couple of questions that I don't think got answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.208" offset="7994856">One is, our claim is based exclusively on the fact that Rodney Fletcher was arrested, that his person was seized without probable cause, and that has been our position from the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.016" offset="8042085">The focus of this is on the certification that made it possible, both under the Federal Constitution and Washington Criminal Rule 2.2, for an arrest warrant rather than a summons to issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.824" offset="8085239">Another question I'd like to point out is Washington law does provide for summons procedures in felony cases, nonseizure-type documents.</text>

            <text syncTime="1993.399" offset="8127558">So you would not have made this claim if there had been no actual arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.583" offset="8148351">Even though the arrest warrant or the certification might have been... it's not in the nature of a defamation claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="2004.519" offset="8172070">It is not in the nature of a defamation claim, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.955" offset="8185863">It is in the nature of a false arrest claim, just as the Malley case was, and, of course, under the Albright case there's considerable controversy at least over whether you even have a 1983 claim if you are only hailed into court by summons, and certainly Mr. Fletcher's damages would be very different if they existed at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.605" offset="8260364">The next question, I'd like to answer Justice O'Connor's question about whether police officers can issue these... can swear in support of arrest warrants, and they certainly can, and I think it is... actually I would differ with Mr. Maleng with regard to whether, under Washington law, a police officer could obtain an arrest warrant without the interposition of a prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.004" offset="8338000">Under our justice court rules, or lower court rules, Washington has a procedure where the prosecutors have begun to file direct in superior court Informations, felonies without going through preliminary hearings in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.263" offset="8391081">In our lower courts, the district courts and municipal courts, we have a criminal rule for the courts of limited jurisdiction, 2.1(c), which provides even citizens can issue complaints, and those complaints can be followed by arrest warrants, again if a complainant swears under oath to facts that make out probable cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2641.328" offset="10719323">So there are many systems in our country, but the common denominator we have now in our States and in the Territories and States and even back into England in the law that this is based on is that when people come into, before a judge or a magistrate or a justice of the peace, or whatever they happen to be called locally, and swear to facts, and get some kind of an order that allows somebody else's body to be seized, they were never held to be immune from liability before 1871, before 1791 when the Oath or Affirmation Clause was put into the Fourth Amendment establishing the function that we believe is relevant here, a very ancient and important function of providing that oath or affirmation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.170" offset="10890686">It's never been subject to immunity, and the fact that the prosecutors in Washington have really voluntarily, just as a matter of their own practice and convenience, or perhaps for this reason, usurped that function, without even the Washington legislature or court rules telling them to, and said well, we'll be the witnesses here, they have taken on a function that prosecutors as far as I can tell, reading... we cited some historical materials that go back into the 13th and 14th Century.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.503" offset="10999982">The prosecutors and their predecessors have never acted as witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.016" offset="11018059">It's a fundamentally different function of swearing to facts and bringing the facts in and saying, I vouch for these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.451" offset="11047839">And in most contexts, of course, there is, as I think Justice Stevens pointed out, a defamation immunity for witnesses, but there has always been an exception in this particular context, where a person comes in, a person who might say exactly the same things at a trial and be absolutely immune, but when the context is the initiation of a matter before some kind of judicial officer, the purpose of which is to take somebody's body into custody, that that person has never been held immune from liability no matter what their rank in society.</text>

I have not grasped yet, Justice Scalia, but what I understand is that whatever you called it at that time, nobody recognized it as a circumstance in which a person should be immune from liability, even though they were doing something, swearing, very much like what they could do in court under absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.062" offset="11334245">When they did it in this context, when ex parte, I would assume that the policy reasons are because there is no protection of the courtroom, it's an ex parte proceeding, it involves an initiation of a very drastic governmental action against a person, whatever those policy reasons were, the common law in 1871 was clear that in that context a swearer, a person who took an oath or affirmation, was not subject to the immunities that they would be later in the proceeding, and I think that is the difference, and there's no historical basis... this one 1927--</text>

            <text syncTime="3072.123" offset="12442464">I have looked at a number of States in regard to this, and the States are very various and the counties, I'm sure, within States vary as to how they handle criminal prosecutions, and when... where the police hand off to the prosecutors, and to draw a line straight through based on Washington's particular procedure I think would be extraordinarily difficult and create different rules in different States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.426" offset="12535669">And, of course, in section 1983 the Civil Rights Act was supposed to, I think, establish Federal minimums for the protection of residents of the various States regardless of what their State officials decided to do, and when the... the fact that our State officials and our prosecutors have over the years said, well, wouldn't it be easier if we just swear the witnesses, and we just provided the oath or affirmation rather than have police officers or FBI agents or the various people who do it in every other jurisdiction of the country perhaps save one, that can't change the constitutional rights and remedies of the people of Washington that were enshrined in 1871 and existed a long time before that, of saying if you lie about me and cause me to be arrested, I have a cause of action to recover for my damages from you.</text>

I think the petitioners here are really refighting Buckley and saying, well, everything we do is designed to, you know, convict or to prosecute or decide whether to prosecute or not, so everything we do should be prosecutorial, and Buckley certainly said that's not the case with regard to particularly one function that was, I think, very analogous to what happened here, which is the manufacturing of false evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.703" offset="13184759">In a very real sense, our claim is that Lynne Kalina manufactured false evidence against Rodney Fletcher, and she did so not only with regard to the trial, but with regard to a critical moment when nobody else was there in court to correct it, that the common law and the cases of the majority of circuits, certainly, since have always said is subject to liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="3571.639" offset="14440518">My experience is that it is fairly typical of both our prosecutors and, of course, of Federal police or law enforcement agents in Federal courts who do the same thing, summarize reports in affidavits, and the Jones v. United States said that hearsay can be the basis of an arrest and arrest warrant, so that is what they're capitalizing upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.881" offset="14521497">But of course here, our submission, and what we plan to prove is that not only was she testifying falsely about what Mr. Fletcher did, but also she's testifying falsely about what's in those police reports, and that will be the question, really, if we get to the question of qualified immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3654.965" offset="14773840">I know of nothing in the common law or any other cases that say that claiming to be a second-hand witness enables you to be absolutely immune, where claiming to be a first-hand witness does not, and oftentimes as long as you're going to allow hearsay there's going to be hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.068" offset="14834235">Actually, it's a third-hand witness versus a second-hand witness, but again, Officer Malley was a second-hand witness testifying to what was in the logs that he had read from other officers.</text>
