            <text syncTime="18.022" offset="226209">The National Forest Management Act requires the United States Forest Service to devise forest plans for each of the units within the national forest system.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.959" offset="257974">That the plans are to be revised at 10 to 15-year intervals, and they perform two basic functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.422" offset="279813">First, they provide general guidance to Forest Service employees in the management of the affected unit and, second, they serve a public informational function by giving the public general information about the likely management activities within the forest and, while the plans vary widely from place to place, all forest plans contain projections concerning anticipated timber harvesting activities within the national forest, and it's that feature of the plan that's at issue here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.668" offset="380854">I'd like to start by saying that in our view it would be misleading to frame the question presented in this case as whether forest plans are reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.212" offset="415023">We're not asking for a per se rule in this case and, indeed, we're really not asking for a special rule for forest plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.077" offset="438428">What we're saying is that the Court should examine the particular plan provision that is at issue and ask whether the decision or determination reflected in that provision is reviewable under ordinary principles of administrative law and, in our view, the timber harvesting projections at issue in this case don't meet that test.</text>

            <text syncTime="118.899" offset="629749">--One of the cases we had in the Ninth Circuit this past summer and fall was a case in which the Forest Service amended the standards and guidelines contained in a plan that regulated the manner in which timber harvesting activities would be conducted and the document that adopted the plan amendment said, these amended standards and guidelines will not apply to ongoing timber harvesting activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.102" offset="710624">And we were sued in that case and the plaintiff's contended that the agency had behaved unlawfully in failing to apply the new standards and guidelines to ongoing projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.647" offset="748763">In the end we prevailed on the merits in that case, but we conceded that that was a justiciable controversy, because the decision not to make the standards and guidelines immediately applicable would have immediate on the ground impact.</text>

            <text syncTime="203.556" offset="968400">We don't believe, in any event, that the affidavits affect the justiciability of plaintiff's facial challenge to the plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="1339.693" offset="5512975">The second is the Sixth Circuit's overturning of the Forest Service multiple use allocations on the basis that the plan overvalued timber, undervalued wilderness recreation, when the agency's broad discretion and technical expertise should have elicited judicial deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.716" offset="5585073">And third, that they concluded even age management is restricted to exceptional circumstance when that very proposition had been addressed and rejected by the Fifth Circuit in an exhaustive opinion which the Sixth Circuit did not even cite or address.</text>

            <text syncTime="1384.633" offset="5692698">Each set of rulings in its own way demonstrates the Sixth Circuit's failure to acknowledge the limited authority of the Federal courts to inject themselves into areas of policy that have been entrusted to the political branches, and this is particularly true in the case of the bias proposal of the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.729" offset="5781096">Respondents did not attempt to defend that, but they did say that it's dicta, and that this Court should ignore it.</text>
