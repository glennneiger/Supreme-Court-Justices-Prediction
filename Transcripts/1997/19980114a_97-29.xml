            <text syncTime="2998.236" offset="12147090">I mean, the... certainly, for the reasons I've explained the three judge district court can't do that because of Article III concerns, and the Attorney General also... although the Attorney General may be able to preclear, and often does preclear enabling legislation, the Attorney General often has to wait until some actual implementation of that is proposed before review... both before reviewing that on the merits and also even making a considered determination as to whether it would be a change affecting voting.</text>
