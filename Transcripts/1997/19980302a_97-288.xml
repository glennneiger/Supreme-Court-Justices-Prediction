            <text syncTime="28.650" offset="269770">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="34.221" offset="292131">Plaintiffs' claims that Brunswick negligently failed to protect against propeller guard injuries in the circumstances of this case should not be preempted for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.397" offset="348764">First of all, the claims we are bringing in this case do not conflict with any Federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.718" offset="374051">Under Freightliner, there's no preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.770" offset="386276">Secondly, the text of the preemption clause, section 4306 of the act, does not, much less clearly and unambiguously, reach the body of State law of general application, common law damage claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.131" offset="455762">Our position there is consistent, we think, with all of the preemption cases of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.968" offset="475092">Thirdly, in this case the reading that we submit for the preemption clause is confirmed by a particular savings clause, where Congress specifically and without qualification provided that compliance with the Boat Safety Act regulation is no defense to common law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.466" offset="561087">In this preemption case, as in every case of statutory interpretation, surely the starting point is the text of the act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.155" offset="599853">We submit in this case it is also the ending point.</text>

            <text syncTime="127.597" offset="665577">Starting with the policy declaration in section 2 of the act, Congress spoke of reciprocity and comity, signal words that State law has a role to play.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.757" offset="718240">It spoke of developing and enforcing Federal and State laws, again signalling that State laws would have a role to play.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.630" offset="757737">And then throughout the act Congress over and over again speaks of the enactment of positive regulations both by the Federal Government and by the State, never any reference to common law claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="188.588" offset="909561">I mean, they are requirements, and I don't see why we should necessarily create... treat this statute differently in that regard.</text>

            <label>Mr. David E. Hudson</label>
            <text syncTime="198.880" offset="950730">--Well, for a couple of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.263" offset="956268">The language used in this statute is different than the language used in both Cipollone and in Medtronic.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.549" offset="981345">In this statute, Congress says that there may not be a State law or regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.722" offset="1010080">In both Cipollone and Medtronic it was a requirement which arose under State law and this Court has, in a number of cases, not only in Cipollone but following that in Medtronic, English v. GE, Goodyear v. Miller, Silkwood, has explained that common law is a traditional State area.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.701" offset="1090015">If we were to obtain a judgment in this case, Brunswick would not be required to put a propeller guard on any of its boats in any State, or in any jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="262.803" offset="1206416">It may be enough that a warning be issued putting consumers on notice that if you are thrown or fall out of this boat there's a danger of this type of injury.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="277.812" offset="1266393">Well, I take it that the main thrust of your argument below is that the propeller guard should have been installed.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.633" offset="1289695">You're going to change the behavior of the manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.901" offset="1298785">That's the whole justification, at least for your punitive damage award, punitive damage claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="295.457" offset="1337029">The punitive damage claim is a heightened incentive to do the steps that are necessary to protect persons who use the boats.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.030" offset="1367331">It would have that impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.863" offset="1374645">But as this Court acknowledged in Silkwood, punitive damage is a customary part of the State common law damage scheme and just because it's a punitive damage claim married with a claim for general damages does not create any heightened point of reference to preempt a State law claim.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="325.710" offset="1458028">On that very point, if... imagine that the Coast Guard here had said what it didn't say, but suppose it said we think that the guards on these propellers are actually a greater danger than an unguarded propeller because somebody can get hit on the head, and that's a bigger chance of harm than the other, so suppose because of that they'd said very clearly, we don't want guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.428" offset="1552905">Now, on your view of the statute a jury would be perfectly free to award punitive damages against the manufacturer because he did the very thing that the Coast Guard told him to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="2577.118" offset="10463690">4305 allows the Coast Guard to grant the exemption, but it's... 4306 says that there's a general preemption of State requirements involving the design and equipment of boats, but the Coast Guard can grant an exemption to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.459" offset="10517084">Secondly, the States can operate... their State law can operate to meet some uniquely hazardous local condition, and third, the States are allowed to enforce their law about the design of boats to the extent that it is identical to a regulation promulgated by the Coast Guard, and the scheme of this is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.273" offset="10592317">The Coast Guard is supposed to promulgate the rules that tell manufacturers what they have to do in order to build a boat, a recreational boat in interstate commerce, and the States can enforce... if the State law is identical to it, the States can participate in the enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.549" offset="10657414">So if a boat is built out of compliance with Federal design requirements, there can be a State law remedy, but the States can't add to the requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.888" offset="10690746">So that they... so that here, for example, you know, you could have a State requirement that has... that it requires that boats be built with propeller guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.780" offset="10730348">That would be a requirement only for one State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.613" offset="10741633">It would dictate the national rule and, if a State had a contrary rule, you couldn't sell a boat in interstate commerce, because one State could say you had to have one type of requirement, another State could say you have to have another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.402" offset="10784787">The idea of this was to have a uniform national rule, and as... the Court actually confronted a case almost precisely like this 20 years ago, Ray v. Atlantic Richfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.841" offset="10822612">That was a case in which Congress passed a statute that promulgated... that authorized the Coast Guard to promulgate design requirements for tankers, and the Coast Guard in fact did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.065" offset="10867438">It promulgated a long list of design requirements for tankers, and then the State of Washington came in and passed a statute that said, if you want to operate in Puget Sound, you also have to follow the following three additional design requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.290" offset="10916340">You have to have double hulls, you have to have two radar, working radar, and this Court held that that statute was preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.296" offset="10948418">It was preempted actually in the absence of an express preemption provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.514" offset="10965241">But the reason the Court gave is... applies here like a glove.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.735" offset="10978093">The Court said, enforcement of these State requirements would frustrate what seems to us to be the evident congressional intent to establish a uniform Federal regime controlling the design of oil tankers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3533.986" offset="14291151">It's consistent with the statement quoted on page 6 of the blue brief by the executive director of the Boatowners Association, who suggested a need for a provision in the law to make it clear that common law claims would survive.</text>

            <text syncTime="3561.738" offset="14402119">Further evidence of the agency's position I think, Justice Scalia, is found in those 1971 and 1973 Federal Register provisions that are cited in all of the briefs where the Coast Guard specifically left in place all laws enacted by the States prior to 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.617" offset="14469620">It was talking about statutory enactments, even felt no need to even speak to the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.419" offset="14488846">If they're going to allow the State law enactments to stay in place, surely the common law survives as well and, in fact, I don't know that there's any recision of those 1971 exemptions from preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.626" offset="14529701">The claims we're making here, the Georgia wrongful death statute is over 100 years old, the negligence standard has existed for as long as the State of Georgia has existed, so the common law has never been a focus of the Coast Guard restriction, or any need to exempt from preemption common law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.802" offset="14598456">In regard to the case of Ray v. Atlantic Richfield, it does not fit this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.890" offset="14622802">That was a situation where the Coast Guard was directed... the statute said it shall issue the regulations governing the size of tankers and other activities on the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.431" offset="14664911">The Coast Guard in fact enacted regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.400" offset="14676823">And if the State of Washington was able to put a limit on tanker sizes, contrary to what the Coast Guard had done, it would be the hypothetical Justice Breyer presented this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.905" offset="14710782">You would have a conflict, and under the Supremacy Clause, the State may not act contrary to any established regulation of the Coast Guard and in this case we don't have an established regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3678.213" offset="14868039">They must overcome the presumption against the displacement of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.431" offset="14884967">They must overcome the requirement that preemption be manifest and clear purpose of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.252" offset="14908163">They must overcome the lack of any statutory or legislative history showing an intent to restrict the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.806" offset="14930420">They must overcome the common understanding of the words used in section 4306.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.460" offset="14949019">Justice Stevens, in Cipollone you made a distinction between a preemption of requirements and in the Senate draft in the tobacco legislation they talked about a statute or regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.916" offset="14994890">That was changed to a requirement, and you pointed out one would be preempted and the other would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.720" offset="15014116">And finally, they would have to overcome the express mention of the common law in the savings provision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.890" offset="15038776">On the other hand, this is a preemption case, after all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.508" offset="15053195">The Federal agency with the authority to regulate agrees that common law claims should not be barred, or, indeed, there is no conflict between anything claimed in our lawsuit and any existing regulation of the Coast Guard and, if our claims are successful, we will only enhance the ultimate goal of the Boat Safety Act, which was to improve safety for people using boats.</text>
