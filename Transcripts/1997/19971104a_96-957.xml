            <text syncTime="1581.330" offset="6473524">Because the wrongful death statute is purely punitive, it doesn't take anything in nature from compensatory damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1594.402" offset="6525769">One was a 32-year-old Georgia Tech engineer with children, making X dollars.</text>

            <text syncTime="1602.321" offset="6557429">It was enough for a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.445" offset="6565997">That recovery was very nominal, because the wrongfulness of the defendant's conduct was minute, maybe applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.739" offset="6599121">Another case in which I represented an 82-year-old Episcopal priest who was a ward of the church, was involved in an accident, but in that case the defendant's conduct violated the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.483" offset="6658157">They put an unreasonably dangerous load, and as a result, that case had tremendous damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.606" offset="6682608">The point I'm trying to make is, the recovery, as you have indicated, is unfair in one regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.900" offset="6707790">It's also unfair as to the compensation aspect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1650.770" offset="6751258">It's the only State that has this punitive damage statute, and it totally frustrates a 1983 action that deals with compensation for the injured, the person injured, as the statute says.</text>

            <text syncTime="3308.950" offset="13383956">--I think not, largely because at the time 1982 was passed many States... I'm not sure if there was quite a majority or not, but many had such caps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.194" offset="13420946">Congress put a cap in in the only wrongful death provision it provided in 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.178" offset="13436933">The situation in Alabama under the Wrongful Death Act is quite similar to the situation this Court has formulated under Bivens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.424" offset="13469847">We know from FDIC v. Myer that you have a Bivens action against Federal officials, the individuals, but no Bivens action against the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.280" offset="13513315">Here, applying the Alabama Wrongful Death Act you have a 1983 action in the case of wrongful death in Alabama against individuals for punitive damages, but you do not have one against the municipality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.774" offset="13563261">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3361.959" offset="13595966">Your Honor, you had indicated that Robertson had an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.676" offset="13614879">Robertson does have an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.973" offset="13620103">On page 1997 it says, we intimate no view, moreover, about whether abatement based on State law could be allowed in a situation in which the deprivation of the Federal right causes a death, which is exactly what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.264" offset="13673289">One final statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.091" offset="13680498">If 1988 did not intend for this Court to review the State court's common law and statutes to determine whether or not they were inconsistent, they would have left that sentence out, but they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.040" offset="13724384">The sentence, a statement that this Court and all Federal courts are to view the State common law and the State statutory laws for their inconsistency to the policy of the Federal 1983, and that I think answers Your Honor's question of why and how this Court has to review the State laws.</text>
