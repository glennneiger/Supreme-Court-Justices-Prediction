            <text syncTime="80.723" offset="475967">In this situation, California claims title and rights to salvage over that same vessel, and the Eleventh Amendment prevents the adjudication of California's interests in this case without its consent.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.736" offset="1467994">And I'm not suggesting that there needs to be a final adjudication, but I'm suggesting that in order to preserve the value of in rem actions there at least ought to be a sufficient showing for the court... from which the court could conclude that you or your State has a serious interest implicated here that justifies recognizing your Eleventh Amendment claim and, in effect, defeating the Federal in rem action, that's all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1675.218" offset="6853920">The first was that courts recognized that they could not issue coercive process against a sovereign's agents to dispossess those agents and create a conflict between the court and the sovereign's agents.</text>

            <text syncTime="2056.150" offset="8377590">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.790" offset="8384173">I think it's quite clear that this case is properly before the admiralty jurisdiction of the Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.213" offset="8405907">Indeed, the Federal admiralty court is the only court where such an action could have been brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.168" offset="8425760">This Court has consistently held that admiralty in rem actions against shipwrecked vessels are uniquely and exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, and this Court has never held that a sovereign, simply by asserting the claim of ownership to the res in the possession of the court divests the court of its constitutionally mandated exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.070" offset="8505277">Rather, this... a long line of this Court's jurisprudence stands for the proposition that only where the property is within the actual physical possession of the sovereign is the action at that point deemed to be an action against the sovereign itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.698" offset="8559821">Where the property is not in the actual possession of the sovereign, the rule is that the case may go forward and the sovereign, if it wishes to do so, may enter into the suit and assert a claim and prove that claim just like any other claimant in the world.</text>

            <text syncTime="2193.679" offset="8927729">It seems to me that under your rule it would be wise, if States want to get control of these abandoned vessels, or sunken vessels, as soon as they hear about it, send the local police out in the appropriate vessels and just take possession, and then let the litigation go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.258" offset="8986034">Doesn't this... doesn't your rule encourage States to use self help in these situations?</text>

            <text syncTime="2215.494" offset="9014978">I think our rule encourages States to locate these wrecks if they want to exercise control over them, and I think that's certainly the purpose of the Abandoned Shipwreck also, which was to encourage States to locate these wrecks and, indeed, the Abandoned Shipwreck Act requires States to give public notice of the location of wrecks to which it claims title under the ASA, so I think this encourages States, if they really want to exercise dominion over these wrecks, to at least locate them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2255.740" offset="9175997">In the Navemar, for instance, in a foreign sovereign immunities context, this Court defined actual possession as some act of physical dominion or control, so at a threshold, certainly the State would need to know where the wreck is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.688" offset="9231794">I mean, it's absurd to say that the State has possession of something and it doesn't even know where it's at, it can't find it, so that has to be a threshold issue.</text>
