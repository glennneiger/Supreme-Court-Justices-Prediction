            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="14.839" offset="216067">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.931" offset="228397">Congress enacted the Federal Credit Union Act to foster the development of strong and stable, cooperative credit institutions so that persons not being served by banks could obtain credit at non-usurious rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.002" offset="288688">Credit union proponents advocated including the common bond provision because experience had shown that credit unions organized around preexisting, cohesive groups were most likely to form economically strong cooperative institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.152" offset="365279">The banks lack standing under the APA to challenge the NCUA's interpretation of the common bond provision because Congress enacted that provision as an organizing principle to promote financially viable credit unions and not to impose substantive restrictions or constraints on competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.924" offset="448348">Thus, the banks' competitive interests are not within the, quote, zone of interests Congress sought to protect.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="80.484" offset="478650">Well, how do you reconcile that petition... position, Mr. Waxman, with our decision in the Clarke case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="86.309" stopTime="144.864">
            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="86.309" offset="501951">Well, Justice Rehnquist, in Clarke, this Court determined that the plaintiffs, the security industry, had standing because it found that Section... Sections 36 and 81 of the McFadden Act, which were the substantive provisions at issue there, had been enacted to reflect a, quote, congressional concern to keep national banks from obtaining monopoly power over credit and money through unlimited branching.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.813" offset="619920">And, therefore, Congress... the Court found, Congress had arguably legislated against the very competition that the securities interest was seeking to challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.715" offset="663493">In this case, the common bond provision, in particular, and even the Federal Credit Union Act in general, was not enacted with any thought to restrict or control competition in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.883" offset="712185">It was enacted in order to provide a means for strengthening the development of credit institutions.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="144.864" offset="736113">Well, Mr. Waxman, the... the Investment Company Institute v. Camp case was enacted, of course, to restrict competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.532" offset="766833">And we found standing there, didn't we?</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="156.608" offset="783133">And I think it's fair to acknowledge that that case, at least in our view, represents the outer limits of where this Court has gone in zone of interest.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="165.308" stopTime="169.276">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="165.308" offset="817928">Yeah, I think that's the... the closest case for the standing argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.683" offset="827437">I mean, how do you get around that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="169.276" stopTime="269.703">
            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="169.276" offset="833811">I... I... I... I think... I think it is... and I think it's important and can be readily distinguished in three ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.962" offset="848544">First of all, although the Court acknowledged that the principle reason for enacting Section 16 of the Glass-Steagall Act had been to protect banks from engaging in investment activities of their own sake, the Court, both in the opinion in Investment Company Institute, and subsequently in Clarke, also noted that Congress had been concerned with, quote, the danger to the economy as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.201" offset="957422">So it wasn't the only reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.247" offset="965677">But, more importantly, the basis for the holding in Investment Company Institute was that Section 16 of the Glass-Steagall Act was legislation against competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.882" offset="1012175">The Court found in that case that Congress had legislated against the competition that the petitioners sought to challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.317" offset="1045925">So even if you construe that case in the broadest possible way... and I would simply adopt Justice Harlan's characterization of the majority opinion in that case in dissent... he said, if Congress prohibited entry into a field of business for reasons relating to competition, then a competitor has standing to seek observance of the prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.213" offset="1141533">Now, he thought that that was a holding that was not warranted by the Court's prior precedence.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.929" offset="1164417">But even if that is what Investment Company Institute v. Camp stands for, that's not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.975" offset="1192524">The common bond provision, and, indeed, the FCUA in general, have nothing to do with competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.222" offset="1217602">They were not... there was not a reason for enacting the common bond--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="269.703" stopTime="277.762">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="269.703" offset="1235470">But in order to find out the answer to that question, what was the reason for enacting the common bond, must we go back into the legislative history?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="277.762" stopTime="299.926">

            <text syncTime="277.762" offset="1267757">--I think you do, because prudential... the prudential standing inquiry this Court has taught is an analysis of what Congress intended; that is, the interest... to quote Association of Data Processors... the interest sought to be protected by the complainant must be arguably within the zone of interest to be protected by the statute.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>

            <text syncTime="306.127" offset="1381128">And here it was clearly an intent to foster the development... the rapid development of stable and strong credit unions, because... and I think it's also important to... to understand this... in 1934, when Congress was considering enactment of the Federal Credit Union Act, the country was beginning to come out of the Great Depression.</text>

            <text syncTime="349.014" offset="1552701">And Con... the legislative history is replete with recognition that notwithstanding the banks' record during the Great Depression, not a single state-chartered credit union had failed.</text>

            <text syncTime="443.947" offset="1932417">The substantive statute at issue in this... in that case was Section 4 of the National Banking Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.991" offset="1956658">And in analyzing the standing question, the Court looked, basically, to two sources: first, the legislative history and the extensive comments in the legislative history that showed that Section 4 was... and I am quoting the Court now... a response to the fears expressed by a few senators that without such a prohibition, the bill would have enabled banks to engage in non-banking activity, and thus constitute a serious exception to the excepted policy which strictly limits banks to banking.</text>

            <text syncTime="511.498" offset="2202627">But, nonetheless, the Court has, on occasion, looked at legislative history to determine Congress' intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.292" offset="2229795">But I think, Justice Scalia, in response to your point, it's also very important, in looking at the Court's opinion in Data Processing, which is the landmark case that established the zone of interest test, it... the Court made explicit reference to two of its prior decisions in competitor standing cases: The Acheson-Topeka Railway case and Hardin v. Kentucky Utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.064" offset="2332926">And it characterized its decision in Association of Data Processing as an extension, or consistent with those prior competitor standing cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.638" offset="2375244">And it's very instructive, I think, if I can just beg the Court's indulgence for a moment, to recite what this Court stated in Harden v. Kentucky Utilities in its 1968 opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.602" offset="2419026">It said:</text>
            <text syncTime="566.102" offset="2421115">This Court has, it is true, repeatedly held that the economic injury which results from lawful competition cannot, in and of itself, confer standing on the injured business to question the legality of any aspect of its competitor's operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.157" offset="2489243">And it cited a line of cases between 1880 and 1940.</text>
