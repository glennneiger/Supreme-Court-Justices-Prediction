            <text syncTime="3201.239" offset="12948721">They simply have selected a nominee who will appear on a ballot, and if by happenstance the same person has been chosen by the respective Democratic and Republican primaries, the election is still held in... the conclusive election is held in November, and the primaries were not legally... were not the legal selection of the congressional officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3236.444" offset="13089573">That's correct, Justice Ginsburg, and section 8, the companion statute to section 7, 2 U.S.C. section 8, is a statute that answers this... that gives us the answer in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.435" offset="13149550">Elections in 1872 were like the elections that Louisiana has today.</text>

            <text syncTime="3260.659" offset="13186435">Everybody voted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.610" offset="13190197">In most States, a plurality election was sufficient to elect a person to Congress, but a number of States have majority vote requirements as does Louisiana today, so therefore Congress inserted section 8 into title 2 to provide for the contingency of a failure to elect on Federal Election Day, and that's the statute that Louisiana could follow and have its post Federal Election Day run-off if it so chose to do that.</text>
