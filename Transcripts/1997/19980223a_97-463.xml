            <text syncTime="11.808" offset="199072">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.274" offset="208894">In 1994, the petitioner employer and the respondent union in this case engaged in collective bargaining required by the National Labor Relations Act and by the decisions of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.817" offset="259050">And the union alleges that in the course of that bargaining the employer failed to supply information that it was obligated to supply concerning subcontracting plans, one of the questions being whether that was a mandatory or permissive subject of bargaining under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.445" offset="329580">And the union first brought its claim before the National Labor Relations Board alleging that the employer had committed an unfair labor practice by failing to bargain in good faith under sections 8(a)(5) and 8(d) of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.955" offset="395618">And apparently dissatisfied with the progress of this complaint before the board, the union then brought an identical action, making exactly the same charges, seeking virtually the same relief, in Federal district court as a declaratory judgment action, purportedly pursuant to section 301 of the National Labor Relations Act, and the board proceeding has been tentatively settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.522" offset="497913">A settlement was approved by the regional director last week, and the board has granted limited relief, ordering that certain provisions of the contract be set aside and awarding back pay but refusing to grant the broad relief that the union had requested, which would be invalidation of the entire contract.</text>

            <label>Mr. Timothy B. Dyk</label>
            <text syncTime="115.339" offset="613165">That is correct, Justice O'Connor.</text>

            <text syncTime="120.259" offset="632810">There's been some limited relief granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.278" offset="644930">Why should... why is there anything left for us?</text>

            <label>Mr. Timothy B. Dyk</label>
            <text syncTime="126.229" offset="656738">Well, we think that the matter should have been resolved by the board proceedings, but as far as the mootness of the court proceeding is concerned the union still claims damages based on the identical facts that led it to request the declaratory judgment and that issue would be unaffected, in the union's view, by the board's settlement.</text>

            <text syncTime="146.160" offset="736463">Well, didn't the collective bargaining agreement also provide for the payment of survivor's benefits for a certain number of years after the contract expired?</text>

            <label>Mr. Timothy B. Dyk</label>
            <text syncTime="154.999" offset="771781">There are a variety of issues which could arise under the collective bargaining agreement because, of course, the effect of that agreement wasn't limited to the 3-year period of the agreement, so for all of these reasons we think there's no real issue of mootness in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.591" offset="830191">Rather, the issue here is whether the district court had jurisdiction under section 301 and, in our view, the language of section 301 is quite plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.614" offset="870210">It provides for suits for violation of collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.685" offset="886511">There's no question here of any violation.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="190.422" offset="913469">But Mr. Dyk, you concede if it came up defensively it would properly be a matter for the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.909" offset="939383">Say the union violated the no-strike clause and the union's answer to that is, this whole contract is no good because it was induced by fraud.</text>

          <turn speaker="timothy_b_dyk" startTime="205.015" stopTime="231.380">
            <label>Mr. Timothy B. Dyk</label>
            <text syncTime="205.015" offset="971879">--Well, Justice Ginsburg, yes, we do agree that if there had been an alleged violation of the agreement and a declaratory judgment were sought, that there had been no violation, that that would be a matter properly within the district court's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.488" offset="1025691">Of course, all the parties agree here that in the course of that proceeding the law that would be applied would be board law, in other words, the good faith bargaining requirements crafted by the board pursuant to the act, so--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="231.380" stopTime="237.902">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="231.380" offset="1077309">But nonetheless there's nothing about the issue that identifies it as an issue only for the board and never for the courts.</text>

            <label>Mr. Timothy B. Dyk</label>
            <text syncTime="237.902" offset="1103432">--That's correct, and what this Court has done, as we understand it, it has said that pursuant to the act, that you can have an affirmative suit that's brought in the courts or an unfair labor practice charge before the board that may involve defenses, defenses before the board concerning contracts, defenses in the courts concerning the interpretation of the act, and that has been brought up in cases like Kaiser Steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.553" offset="1213982">But the courts have... this Court has recognized a distinction between bringing something as an affirmative matter and bringing it as a defensive matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.159" offset="1244388">For example, in Communications Workers v. Beck, which was not a case exactly like this but it involved the duty of fair representation, this Court held that the employer's alleged violation of 8(a)(3) of the act could be raised as a defense to the claim, but that an 8(a)(3) claim could not be asserted at the outset in Federal court, and there's a good reason--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="294.922" offset="1331428">But Mr. Dyk, isn't it the whole purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act to enable you to anticipate your defenses instead of having to wait for a lawsuit by the other side?</text>
            <text syncTime="306.463" offset="1377613">Isn't the whole purpose of it to enable the union, for example, in this case to come into court and say, we do not intend to live up to this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.467" offset="1405616">We're going to strike, and we think we have a right to strike because the agreement is invalidated by the fraud at the beginning, and we want a declaratory judgment to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.275" offset="1452845">It seems to me a classical declaratory judgment action.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.060" offset="1467996">--Justice Scalia, I think it is not a classic declaratory judgment action in the sense that this Court has held repeatedly in the Franchise Tax Board case, in Skelly Oil and a number of others, that the Declaratory Judgment Act can't expand the jurisdiction of the Federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="349.073" offset="1548036">Now, if the court had jurisdiction because there had been a violation of the act and there was a controversy over whether there had been a violation of the act, of course there would be jurisdiction under 301(c).</text>

            <label>Mr. Timothy B. Dyk</label>
            <text syncTime="3203.475" offset="12965740">Just briefly, Mr. Chief Justice, if you look at the complaint that was filed in this case, which is pages 16 to 19 of the joint appendix, and particularly to paragraphs 5 through 10, which are the operative paragraphs, you can see quite clearly that the theory of this complaint is a failure to supply information in response to the union's request.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.257" offset="13060826">This is at the heart of the board's expertise and the board's jurisdiction, determining when there is an obligation on the part of the employer to supply information to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.030" offset="13099905">The union has admitted in its brief that board law must apply to this proceeding, so we suggest that in terms of the substantive rules, there's an exact parallel here between the complaint theory and the board theory, and Justice Stevens, I don't know of a lot of cases where the board has addressed misrepresentations in the context of permissive bargaining, but there's no reason as a matter of theory that that shouldn't be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.978" offset="13195722">And if one looks at the brief filed by the United States here, the United States does not suggest that there's any gap in the jurisdiction of the board with respect to this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.668" offset="13234488">They make very clear that the board can invalidate contracts, make employees whole... there's an absolute identity of the theories that can be brought before the board and the relief that can be gotten from the board, and the board was set up by Congress to determine what relief should be granted under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.295" offset="13305019">Sometimes it will be invalidation of the whole contract or, as here, a part of the contract, and it's that kind of discretion, that kind of expertise which the board has and the courts don't have and is a primary reason why this Court should not permit the Federal courts to, in essence, adjudicate unfair labor practices that otherwise would come before the board.</text>

            <text syncTime="3309.609" offset="13390178">In fact, the board settlement awarded back pay damages and the United States in its brief acknowledged that the board can award these kinds of damages.</text>
