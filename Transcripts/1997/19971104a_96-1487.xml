            <text syncTime="13.474" offset="205628">Respondent was about to board a flight to Syria when a Customs inspector informed him that he was required to file a currency report if he was taking more than 10,000 dollars with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.615" offset="246275">Respondent claimed that he was taking less than 10,000 dollars and he therefore did not file a currency report.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.519" offset="269889">Customs inspectors searched respondent and his possessions and found more than 350,000 dollars in cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.673" offset="302490">Respondent subsequently pleaded guilty to wilfully failing to file a currency report as he was about to transport more than 350,000 dollars outside this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.064" offset="343973">For that offense, Congress has mandated forfeiture of the unreported currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.717" offset="366647">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held, however, that the forfeiture of any of that currency would constitute an excessive fine.</text>

            <text syncTime="64.156" offset="408338">First, the unreported currency is an instrumentality of a reporting offense and may be forfeited as such without violating the Excessive Fines Clause, and second, even if it is not an instrumentality, its forfeiture is a permissible punishment for what is a serious criminal offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2274.206" offset="9248593">We have property divided in three areas, contraband, proceeds of contraband, and an instrumentality, and contraband and proceeds of contraband have always been a strong remedial interest, and have been forfeited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.263" offset="9296867">Instrumentality, there has to be a connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.315" offset="9308988">In this particular case, and I would agree from a common, practical point of view, we're splitting hairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.703" offset="9334588">When we're talking about an instrumentality, should it really relate to a substantial connection?</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.357" offset="9353187">I believe there should be some type of cutoff point in reference to instrumentality, but the historical legal fiction doesn't really fit any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.694" offset="9386520">In other words, it's... we now look under modern times that the... in reference to the property, as to the use of the property, and not truly in relation to its respect as to how it was used during piracy times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.437" offset="9445556">I think the key issue in this matter is whether the district court used the appropriate standard of grossly disproportionate when it forfeited approximately 15,000 dollars.</text>
