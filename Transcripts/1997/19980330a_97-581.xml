            <text syncTime="19.594" offset="226913">This case is about Pennsylvania's ability to properly supervise the 21,000 prisoners who have been released from jail into the community on parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.391" offset="270068">In this case, Keith Scott, the respondent, was a convicted murderer given a 20-year prison sentence and was released on parole in his eleventh... during his eleventh year.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.589" offset="318864">That release was subject to a number of conditions, among them that he not possess or use firearms, that he not possess or use drugs or alcohol, that he reside in an approved residence, and the condition most important for the consideration of this case was a requirement that he consent to a search of his person.</text>

            <text syncTime="68.346" offset="421891">I take it the Pennsylvania courts have determined that the consent provision that was signed simply did not go beyond consent to search without a warrant and determined that that did not mean that consent was given to a search without reasonable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.242" offset="513424">I take it that's the thrust of what the courts below found.</text>

            <text syncTime="688.833" offset="2903837">For instance, the... hearsay evidence is readily admitted in parole revocation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.919" offset="2944170">There is a... it's an informal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.962" offset="2960366">Normally, the case for the parole board would be presented by a parole agent, not an attorney, not an attorney representing the parole board, but a parole agent who would give his version of the facts, his version of what the parolee has done while out on parole, and there's a vastly different give-and-take in the process of the parole hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.986" offset="3052422">For instance, parolees generally testify, give testimony as to what they have done, and so it is a very informal, flexible proceeding, and that is why I believe it is important for a parole board to be able to get the benefit of all relevant evidence which goes to the question of whether or not that parolee should be allowed to stay in the community subject to the conditions or to be turned... to be sent back to jail, so that's why we would ask that the exclusionary rule not be extended to parole revocation proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="802.907" offset="3360144">And the first, it's either-or, and the either says, either that the parole officer can conduct a search at any time and for any reason, i.e., it does not consent to random searches, or that he relinquish his Fourth Amendment rights, so it sounds because of that either-or that the Court in Pennsylvania is holding that this consent is not a consent to random searches, and if that is so, how could we reach the issue of whether it is constitutionally permissible for a State to do what you want to do, which is to conduct random searches?</text>

            <text syncTime="870.441" offset="3630250">That goes back to the Williams case, but an analysis of the Williams case, Williams... Commonwealth v. Williams in Pennsylvania, as opposed to the other case which Justice Stevens referred to, an analysis of that Williams case goes in quite at length as an analysis of what is required under both the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and what is required under article I, section 8 of the Pennsylvania constitution, and we believe very strongly that the Court couched their opinion in both Williams and in Scott on what they interpreted the requirements of the Fourth Amendment to do, and that is where we disagree.</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="1001.149" offset="4153117">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.970" offset="4208393">Although the United States believes that parole may validly be conditioned on the parolee's consent to search, we also believe that this case can be decided on the alternative ground that the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule should not apply to parole revocation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.109" offset="4264922">This Court, when deciding whether the exclusionary rule should be extended to procedural settings other than the criminal trial, has recognized that that determination turns on a balance of the public and governmental interests at stake against the likely determination of exclusion of unlawfully acquired evidence, and in our view there are two distinct governmental interests that militate against application of the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.393" offset="4350081">First, and I think the nub of our argument is that where an individual has already been convicted of a crime and has been released in the community based upon the condition that he abide by specified terms of release, there is an overriding public and governmental interest in accurate and complete information regarding the question of whether the parolee has, in fact, complied with those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.368" offset="4437957">At the very premise of parole is that parolees, persons previously convicted of crimes, pose a greater risk of committing further unlawful acts than does the average citizen, and the purpose of the revocation hearing is not simply to punish the parolee for violation of the conditions of his release but rather to determine whether the parolee can safely be left in the community.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1094.444" stopTime="1138.644">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1094.444" offset="4526250">Yes, but is that realistic, because I don't know how much longer this individual is going to be put away as a result of the revocation here, but I assume that in most States a parole revocation can result in a very substantial incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.063" offset="4584765">And I am assuming the second thing that you may want to comment on, and that is that if there is a substantial period of reincarceration, the likelihood of an independent criminal prosecution for the acts that led to the commitment, recommitment, is probably very low.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.844" offset="4647877">The State is probably not going to bother to prosecute if they can put the person away for a substantial period of time on a parole revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.598" offset="4678910">So my questions are, isn't it in fact a lot like a criminal trial?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="1138.644" stopTime="1216.356">
            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="1138.644" offset="4703047">It is certainly... it has some of the same consequences of a criminal trial, namely that the individual is incarcerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.627" offset="4731050">With respect to Mr. Scott, the State has represented in its reply brief that Scott was up for reparole I believe in 1997 and reparole was denied, and that he is up for reparole again in 1998, so certainly the finding of parole violations may ultimately have the effect of requiring him to serve his whole term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.752" offset="4811508">On the other hand, they do not preclude the possibility that he can convince the State parole board that in fact he warrants rerelease notwithstanding both the prior crime and the subsequent violation of the terms of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.442" offset="4862290">As to your second question, while parole does have some of the same consequences as the initial criminal conviction, the Court has recognized most emphatically in Morrissey v. Brewer that the parole revocation proceeding need not take on the procedural accoutrements of the criminal trial, that because the individual's initial liberty interest has already been extinguished by the fact of the prior crime and the prior conviction, what is at stake is the conditional liberty interest of somebody who has been released as subject both to conditions that wouldn't be imposed on the citizenry at large and closer supervision and monitoring to make sure that those conditions are met.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1216.356" stopTime="1302.265">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1216.356" offset="5013904">I think what I had in the back of my mind was this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.069" offset="5028742">The argument is made, and I guess, as I recall, it's made here, that nothing much is to be gained for society at large by applying an exclusionary rule here because it's already gained by applying the exclusionary rule in criminal trials, so that in point of fact, if the officer is not deterred from illegal conduct by knowledge that the evidence so seized cannot be used in a criminal trial, there's not going to be any incremental deterrence by saying well, you can't use it in a parole revocation either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.163" offset="5173147">If, on the other hand, the parole revocation is probably going to be the only proceeding in which this evidence is used, if the parole revocation really is functioning like a criminal trial and that's the only trial that there's going to be, then the argument about deterring the police is not a sound... or the parole officers in this case is not a sound argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.049" offset="5268650">Because in fact the only proceeding in which the evidence is likely to be used to satisfy society's demands is the proceeding for the revocation of parole and therefore it would make sense, if we are going to take the Fourth Amendment to apply here, to say there ought to be an exclusionary rule for the same reason that we do in the case of a normal criminal trial.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="1302.265" offset="5357571">I think the two answers we would say to that are, first, individual cases may arise in which the primary or even the only use of the evidence acquired is for parole revocation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.709" offset="5399367">But an officer certainly wouldn't know that before he or she began to conduct the search, and the possibility that evidence of very serious additional criminal acts might be discovered and might not be usable at a subsequent criminal prosecution for those acts would be expected to amount to a substantial deterrent to the extent that the individual parole officer was looking at things from a law enforcement perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.957" offset="5492363">The other thing, the point I would like to make, and I think this follows on the heels of the point that General Fisher was making, is that we expect parole officers to operate under a different incentive structure than do police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.614" offset="5538966">That is not to deny that there is a law enforcement component to what parole officers do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.399" offset="5558087">Certainly there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.300" offset="5561744">But the parole officer also develops a continuing relationship with the parolee, thinks of the parolee as a client in some sense, and is expected to balance those two possibly competing obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.218" offset="5609392">And for instance, this Court has said that magistrates and State legislators don't need the deterrent of the exclusionary rule, because they can be expected to be neutral without it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.305" offset="5649725">Presumably the Court didn't mean that magistrates and State legislators have no interest in the apprehension of criminals or the enforcement of the criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.990" offset="5684415">Rather, those officials are neutral in the sense that they are institutionally well-positioned to take account both of the societal interest in the enforcement of the law and the individual interest in avoiding unwarranted incursions on personal liberty, and we--</text>

            <text syncTime="1494.219" offset="6125362">Well, the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule question is... it's a question of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.954" offset="6148350">It is constitutionally grounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.532" offset="6154619">Obviously, the Court has said that the exclusionary rule is not constitutionally compelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.345" offset="6169875">The Court has, however, held that State courts are required to employ the Federal... the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule in State criminal proceedings, and to that extent this Court has held it has authority to require that procedure of at least some State officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.208" offset="6237375">Again, going back to what we see as the overriding governmental interest here, this Court in Lopez-Mendoza made clear that the exclusionary rule, at least ordinarily, would not be applicable in situations where the purpose of a proceeding was to determine whether an ongoing violation was being committed, as opposed to proceedings where the purpose was to impose a sanction for a prior violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.563" offset="6338730">I mean, in some sense a parole revocation hearing has attributes of both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.807" offset="6355762">On the one hand, we are talking about a violation, possession of firearms, that occurred at a discrete point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.462" offset="6382303">On the other hand, the point of the proceeding is, again, to determine not simply whether Mr. Scott should be punished for a prior bad act, but whether he can safely be allowed to remain in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.590" offset="6422845">And the final thing I'd say is, we do think that the nature of parole revocation hearings is such that imposition of the exclusionary rule would substantially change the character of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.107" offset="6468925">That is, in the Federal system, for instance... I'm sorry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1587.752" offset="6499540">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.686" offset="6515214">As an initial matter I think there are two reasons why the Court should not raise... reach the issue of whether a parolee can voluntarily consent to suspicionless searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.943" offset="6560249">The first one the Court has already mentioned, and that is that there is an independent and adequate State ground here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.356" offset="6581878">Unlike Michigan v. Long, this case involves a State regulation, a State parole form to construe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.602" offset="6610926">Michigan v. Long just involved a free-floating constitutional analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.347" offset="6629839">Secondly, this Court said in Griffin that when there is a State regulation involved, as in this case, we take the meaning as fixed by the Supreme Court before we get to any constitutional analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.732" offset="6675397">Thirdly, if you look at the Pennsylvania supreme court in this case, as far as the opinion, the supreme court opinion refers only to one case, Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.719" offset="6711341">It says, we rely on Williams, the Pennsylvania supreme court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.302" offset="6725656">It says that twice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1646.485" offset="6734433">In regard to your second point, Mr. Sosnov, we do have several cases that say if a State court in deciding a question before it is mistakenly of the view that its conclusion is required by the Fourth Amendment, then we will... we have jurisdiction to disabuse it of that if we don't think it's required by the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1745.961" offset="7132330">There's another Pennsylvania supreme court case, Commonwealth v. Gibson, cited in my brief, which says as a matter of State Pennsylvania law consent has to be specific and unequivocal, and now that gets to my second position.</text>
