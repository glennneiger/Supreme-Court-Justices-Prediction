            <text syncTime="10.039" offset="195002">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.324" offset="212138">This case arises out of a holding by the court of appeals that a particularly stringent standard of review, and not abuse of discretion or manifest error, should govern appellate review of district court decisions, excluding expert testimony under Rule 702 and this Court's Daubert opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.219" offset="283714">The factors that this Court has considered in its recent standard of review decisions all point to abuse of discretion as the appropriate standard here: the broad discretion given to trial courts under Federal Rules of Evidence 104(a) and 702, the consistent practice before the adoption of the Federal Rules of deferential appellate review of decisions admitting expert testimony, and the clear functional advantages of the trial courts in making these intensely fact-bound determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.073" offset="403146">Indeed, the conclusion that abuse of discretion is the appropriate standard for review of 702 decisions has been reached by no less than 10 courts of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.596" offset="441180">Notwithstanding all these considerations, the court below embraced what it called particularly stringent review for decisions excluding, but not admitting, expert testimony, citing as authority its reading of this Court's Daubert opinion and the Third Circuit's opinion in Paoli, which had called for a, quote, hard look at exclusions of expert testimony that rejul... result in summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.728" offset="541699">In so doing, the court below articulated an expressly one-sided standard of review, whose precise scope and meaning are not clear and whose likely and perhaps intended effect seems to be to discourage the exercise of the discretion inherent in the gatekeeping function this Court outlined in Daubert.</text>

            <text syncTime="117.475" offset="624769">Mr. Kuney, even if you're correct, that the abuse of discretion is the standard of review, the Respondents tell us that we still would have to affirm under an abuse of discretion standard, and it doesn't make any difference in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.372" offset="700315">Are you going to address that argument?</text>

            <text syncTime="142.876" offset="726333">I think that part of Respondents' argument, as I understand it, is that the court was merely ruling on a matter of law, and never had occasion to apply its novel standard of review.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.629" offset="957360">The court then proceeds to basically disagree with what the district court had done with respect to animal studies and epidemiolog... epidemiological data, but never to declare or find that the court abused its discretion in making the decisions that it had made.</text>

            <text syncTime="311.633" offset="1401337">If... and you may want to comment on whether this is so or not... but if the district court did not make it clear from its own exposition whether it was focusing on results rather than methodology... if there is an ambiguity there... would you agree that the court of appeals may resolve that ambiguity in, in effect, any reasonable way, and that the resolution of that ambiguity, in deciding whether the... the lower court opinion should be read as focusing on result or on method, is... is something that we should accept, so long as either resolution was... was reasonable?</text>

            <text syncTime="1036.019" offset="4298943">The gatekeeper role that this Court prescribed in Daubert, as we understand it and as the terms of Rule 702 suggest, applies to the testimony of the expert and whether that testimony should be allowed, not just to the question of what studies the expert can advert to... and usually these are studies done by others, not by himself... but what he can say about those studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.490" offset="4428824">Part of the scientific methodology is scientific reasoning, what conclusions are scien... scientifically, can be said to follow, or at least arguably to follow, from the premises one has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.671" offset="4513461">Many scientists could be found who could describe published studies conducted by others, but the experts are selected by the parties on the basis of what's important in the case, what inferences they're willing to draw from the published studies, and how they're willing to relate those inferences to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.936" offset="4598620">And what... what counts in these cases, in the gatekeeping function, is to separate what is scientific reasoning and worthy of consideration under Rule 702 from what is not supported by scientific reasoning and relating published studies to the issues in the case, and therefore should not be submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.639" offset="4721396">That is a question based on what is proper scientific reasoning rather than quite the same legal question that Justice Scalia was adverting to in what is sufficient evidence to support a judgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.535" offset="4804987">And this, as Respondents concede, is a very contextual, fact-intensive question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.260" offset="4847828">We point out in foot... footnote 8, on page 18 of our brief, that there are legal situations in which the question before the court is whether there is a risk to public health or a danger to the environment, including a danger to animal habitats, which would make certain studies relevant in inferences that can be drawn through scientific reasoning to the ultimate issue in the case; quite a different ultimate issue from what's involved here, which is not preventing conduct that may be harmful in a general sense, but trying to determine whether it is more probable than not that a particular person's injury was caused by the defendant.</text>
