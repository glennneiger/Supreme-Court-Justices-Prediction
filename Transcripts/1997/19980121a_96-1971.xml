            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="146277">We'll hear argument now in Number 96-1971, Mary Anna Rivet v. the Regions Bank of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.946" offset="182013">Mr. Odom.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. John G. Odom</label>
            <text syncTime="9.888" offset="185774">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.770" offset="197268">The issue in this case, Your Honors, is whether a novel res judicata exception should be engrafted into the settled rules of Federal removal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.364" offset="231645">Before we address these removal issues, I believe it would be helpful to set out in the nature of the action that we filed in State court below on behalf of these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.410" offset="267903">Your Honors, my clients loaned $1.3 million in 1984 to other sophisticated individuals in a transaction at a time of high interest rates, at an interest rate of 20 percent with a note and a subsequent mortgage up to an amount of $5 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.732" offset="337180">We took a note and we took a mortgage on the real property, or the leasehold estate which is at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.976" offset="362153">Basically our State action filed 10 years later is a standard mortgage foreclosure action seeking either to recognize our mortgage or to have our debt paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.022" offset="406352">It's a hybrid in personam in rem action which is permissible under Louisiana law.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.987" offset="426205">There's a second aspect of our claim which is similar but distinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.780" offset="441356">That is, a prior bankruptcy proceeding, as the Court is aware, had authorized the respondents in this action or their predecessors in interest to procure cancellation of our lien, which was duly recorded in the conveyance records of Orleans Parish, and it empowered them to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.668" offset="500915">They left bankruptcy court one day in 1986 with the right to have our lien canceled according to the Louisiana lien cancellation procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.946" offset="534039">They never took advantage of that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.187" offset="543025">The bankruptcy court acknowledged, we take the position, Your Honors, implicitly Louisiana's procedure to have liens cancelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.810" offset="569461">It acknowledged a two step process, because it not only ordered the subject property to be sold free and clear of all liens, it also ordered that the recorder of mortgages erase the liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.327" offset="611570">This was never done and now, in a footnote, if you will, to this argument, they've waited too long and since the filing of this lawsuit their right to execute on those liens has expired under Louisiana law.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="128.134" offset="658799">Am I correct in understanding you're explaining why res judicata won't bar your claim?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_odom" startTime="131.708" stopTime="167.001">
            <label>Mr. John G. Odom</label>
            <text syncTime="131.708" offset="673010">Your Honor, I'm just trying to give a little background to the facts, because I feel that... I feel that it would be important.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.982" offset="698192">The facts are somewhat tangled and I thought it would be good to lay those out.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.934" offset="709999">We don't feel it's... there are a variety of reasons why we don't believe res judicata would bar our claim and those we will all adjudicate below, assuming that it's remanded, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.668" offset="748870">Your Honors, it's important to remember in that connection that two of the four persons that we sued were not even present in the bankruptcy proceeding, and two of our four petitioners did not appear in the bankruptcy proceeding and received absolutely no notice of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.889" offset="805817">We claim against these two--</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="167.001" offset="814280">May I ask, does that have anything to do with any issue except whether there's estoppel here?</text>
            <text syncTime="170.994" offset="830163">I'm just a little puzzled why we have to get into the facts in this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_odom" startTime="174.935" stopTime="224.496">
            <label>Mr. John G. Odom</label>
            <text syncTime="174.935" offset="845941">--Your Honor, it's important for us, we believe, to show the Court exactly how far this doctrine will go if a res judicata exception is carved out on the facts of this case and, that being so, you would have to see that this is not even a proper res judicata situation, because two of the four persons were not even... two of the four persons we sued were not even a part of the bankruptcy proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.072" offset="946564">Therefore, my point in bringing these to the Court's attention, Your Honor, is, look at how far this goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.005" offset="966208">Where it's going is, if you have any part of a claim that a bankruptcy procedure has affected in any way someone, or that person's privity and interest in any way, or that can be alleged, that's going to be brought up by defendants as a res judicata exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.146" offset="1026813">It doesn't have to be a complete res judicata exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.787" offset="1037366">Indeed, it wasn't in this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="224.496" stopTime="229.832">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="224.496" offset="1044158">But your point, as I understand your brief, is that even a narrow res judicata exception should not be recognized.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_odom" startTime="229.832" stopTime="230.411">
            <label>Mr. John G. Odom</label>
            <text syncTime="229.832" offset="1065578">Absolutely, Your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="230.411" stopTime="234.534">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="230.411" offset="1067877">So you're just saying this is the parade of horribles.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.323" offset="1075505">If we take the first step, we go down the slippery slope.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_odom" startTime="234.534" stopTime="329.307">
            <label>Mr. John G. Odom</label>
            <text syncTime="234.534" offset="1084386">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.024" offset="1086372">That's exactly what I'm trying to suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.055" offset="1094417">And Your Honor... well, we believe that the opinions below were not even internally consistent, if you will, in that connection, because they likened their new jurisdictional basis to... of complete preclusion to complete preemption, but complete preemption, as this Court has stated over and over again, really means complete preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.440" offset="1171949">It means that Congress has so thoroughly occupied a whole field of the law that any State law claim is really a Federal claim, but here complete preclusion, as they use it, is not complete because this State action was not completely precluded by res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.627" offset="1232762">To show just how far it goes, Your Honor, not only did the district court below decide the case on the merits, decide that there was no claim there, that the plaintiffs were dead, if you will, and use that as a basis for removal jurisdiction, he then used that removal jurisdiction to get supplemental jurisdiction over the two parties who were not involved in the res judicata aspect, and so what we have is the decision on the merits that the claim was completely precluded being used as justification to assert supplemental jurisdiction over parties whose claim... against whose claims we did not have a completely precluded claim, so it really is not even internally consistent and it does show, if you will, the parade of horribles.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.904" offset="1397856">But fundamentally, Your Honors, as we've stated in our brief, res judicata is an affirmative defense and removal cannot be based on an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.091" offset="1430561">It's codified in the statute, it's been reconfirmed many times by this Court, most recently by Franchise Tax Board, by Caterpillar, and by Oklahoma Tax Commission--</text>

          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="329.307" stopTime="338.864">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="329.307" offset="1463475">And I take it if we adopted your position we could leave intact the doctrine that originated in Avco v. Aero Lodge, the preemptive... the preemption doctrine.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_odom" startTime="338.864" stopTime="394.699">
            <label>Mr. John G. Odom</label>
            <text syncTime="338.864" offset="1501719">--Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.503" offset="1504226">We don't urge an... that the preemption doctrine has to be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.215" offset="1519064">That is now so firmly in... fixed in the jurisprudence of this Court that we believe that it has worked well.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.971" offset="1550097">It's fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.560" offset="1552501">It doesn't have to be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.072" offset="1558561">But the Court has been very careful about articulating any further exceptions to the well pleaded complaint rule if the Avco doctrine be an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.028" offset="1594297">I know there's academic dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.949" offset="1602029">What is clear with respect to the facts of this case is that, even if the affirmative defense, the Federal affirmative defense is the only real issue in the case, even if it is absolutely dispositive of the merits and is the only thing that has to be decided below, it cannot be used as a basis for Federal removal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.241" offset="1675172">Now, there is nothing special about the res judicata affirmative defense as opposed to any other affirmative defenses that might be raised by someone below as a justification for removing a case to Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.277" offset="1719371">Indeed, Your Honors--</text>

          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="394.699" stopTime="408.798">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="394.699" offset="1725013">Well, they could be to the extent the Anti Injunction Act makes an exception, the relitigation exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.922" offset="1753957">That does show that there is something special about relitigating a case that was resolved in Federal court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_odom" startTime="408.798" stopTime="468.117">
            <label>Mr. John G. Odom</label>
            <text syncTime="408.798" offset="1781438">--Your Honor, that does show that Congress has recognized the relitigation situation, has addressed it in the appropriate way after full consideration, and has crafted the relitigation exception to section 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.758" offset="1833265">That is a different remedy, though, than removal based upon res judicata, because, as this Court's ruling in Chick Kam Choo makes clear, the 2283 relitigation exception to the Anti Injunction Act is narrower than the full range of res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.428" offset="1903900">It also is an equitable proceeding, and the Court does not have to enjoin a State court from relitigating something that's previously been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.243" offset="1935247">The Court can take full cognizance of all the facts and circumstances, the equitable arguments on both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.226" offset="1955100">I dare say if that exception had been applied in this case there are equities on both sides of this case that would need to have been considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.591" offset="1980595">It's far different from enlarging the scope of Federal removal jurisdiction by making res judicata an affirmative defense, a permissible basis for removal jurisdiction.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="468.117" offset="2018734">Your claim, leaving aside the bankruptcy, is wholly State in origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.572" offset="2044543">There's no Federal element to it, is there?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. John G. Odom</label>
            <text syncTime="476.882" offset="2053738">That's absolutely correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.284" offset="2059381">In fact, in trying to cast in my own mind as to whether there would be any conceivable way that our claim could be recharacterized as a Federal claim, I can't imagine how our claim could have been recharacterized on the face of the pleadings or any other way so as to state a Federal cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.874" offset="2125732">There is no general Federal law of mortgages that I'm aware of.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.896" offset="2137853">There's no Federal statute that deals with the issues that we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.108" offset="2150705">We have a third party beneficiary claim against the Browns under Louisiana State law, under the Louisiana State law doctrine of stipulation pour entree, which is similar to the third party beneficiary doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.777" offset="2193337">All of those are third party claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.946" offset="2198039">Not a single one is a Federal claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.438" offset="2203995">That's why we feel so strongly that this cannot be cast as an artful pleading case.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.042" offset="2226355">There's no way that we could have artfully recast any of our pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.304" offset="2243492">There's nothing we could have artfully recast.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.156" offset="2250806">Even if the statute and the jurisprudence of the Court allowed us to plead on the face of our pleadings an affirmative defense to somehow get ourselves into Federal court, I don't see how it could have been recast in an artful way as a Federal affirmative defense, so it's an entirely State law cause of action, something that we could not have brought in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.097" offset="2322590">The res judicata issue that they try to bring us in on removal is something that we did not bring... it's somebody else's bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.261" offset="2351221">It's a very far cry from the simple situation where A sues B in Federal court and loses and then A goes back down to Federal court, to State court and brings the identical claim in State court leaving out one or two words.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.509" offset="2400226">That's the situation that the Court had in the Moitie petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.092" offset="2414541">It's a very far cry from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.564" offset="2420497">It wasn't our bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.514" offset="2424259">Two of our petitioners weren't even there, had no notice of any of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.566" offset="2436484">Two of the defendants weren't even there, and the State courts... the Federal court had to acknowledge that they weren't bound by the res judicata that he used to remove the case and assumed supplemental jurisdiction over them and dismissed that claim as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.982" offset="2482146">I think that there is truly nothing special about res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.527" offset="2504298">If you were to allow the res judicata defense to establish removal of jurisdiction it's hard to see why other defenses, other affirmative defenses might not be as worthy, but the Court has already spoken to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.747" offset="2561245">Indeed, Your Honors, any given application of res judicata is likely to be less significant than any given application of the tribal immunity defense, because tribal immunity is the result of a solemn treaty between the Congress of the United States and a sovereign Indian nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.596" offset="2620595">It's hard to think of how something could be more completely extinguished than a claim of... based on... claim falling to the defense of tribal immunity, yet this Court in Oklahoma Tax Commission in 1989 said that that has to be decided by the State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.256" offset="2679214">The State courts are presumed competent to decide these issues of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.939" offset="2693947">They do it all the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1374.063" offset="5642440">Plaintiffs, in the guise of a State court foreclosure action, have launched a collateral attack on a prior order of the bankruptcy court, in this case the bankruptcy court sitting in the Eastern District of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.910" offset="5689879">I'd like to take issue initially with a couple of comments that Mr. Odom made concerning the import of the order and its application under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.899" offset="5737839">What's not at issue is what the order says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.650" offset="5748811">This is not a situation where we're arguing about does the order say X or does the order say Y. The order clearly states that a sale is going to be made under the auspices of the bankruptcy court free and clear of all liens, mortgages, claims, et cetera, and the mortgage that the petitioners seek to foreclose on is specifically listed in the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.326" offset="5843479">There's no question about that, and what petitioners are seeking to do is attack the validity of the order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1469.185" offset="6022992">I believe Justice Breyer's question dealing with Moitie points that out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1477.641" offset="6056742">The argument here... in that instance the recharacterization was that there was a Federal cause of action stated, although in disguise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.186" offset="6091015">Our position here is that the petitioners are in effect taking either an out of time appeal from the bankruptcy court order, or you could interpret what they're as a Rule 9024 motion, essentially a Rule 60 motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.926" offset="6149947">They are seeking to attack the bankruptcy court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.810" offset="6161441">The Fifth Circuit saw the case that way and made specific reference in several points during its opinion to the fact that this is a collateral attack.</text>

            <text syncTime="1531.717" offset="6273141">If you file a Rule 60 or a Rule 9024 motion in Federal court you don't need an independent basis for jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1571.864" offset="6433637">The artful pleading doctrine, as I had understood it, was that you cannot by artful pleading avoid the possibility of removal, but I don't think it's ever been construed quite as broadly as you construe it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1599.094" offset="6542620">One of the things that makes this case a little bit different from Moitie on the surface but not, I believe, once you look underneath it, is the fact that in bankruptcy typically a creditor comes in objecting to something that's going to happen and what they're seeking to do is have a State court sit in review of the propriety of the order issued by the court simply by saying I'm going to foreclose on a mortgage that this order says no longer exists.</text>

            <text syncTime="3074.997" offset="12446189">May it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.631" offset="12456742">I have just a couple of points to make in response to some of the questions that were directed to Mr. Stern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.575" offset="12480566">As far as taking a footnote and running with it, I didn't make this obvious point in my argument, but we did make it in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.122" offset="12518705">Taking this particular footnote and running with it, if you're a district judge below, is even less appropriate than in other circumstances, because here we had three unanimous opinions of this Court following the date of the footnote that expressly reconfirmed all of the fundamental elements of removal jurisdiction in exactly the way that we've argued, so a clearer view than that would be hard to find.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.626" offset="12604700">I agree with Mr. Stern that stability of titles is important, but under his view the State recordation doctrine is of no moment at all and can be completely ignored when, if there is a bankruptcy, a two part bankruptcy judgment order, the first part where the judge snaps his fingers and says, poof, if you will, all liens... the property may be sold free and clear of all liens, and the second part of his order orders and directs and authorizes the erasure of all the liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.305" offset="12715459">The second part is not taken care of and is not fulfilled, then if you simply allow him to rely on the first part of it, then it says that the entire State record, State title recordation policy is of no moment at all, because a party in another State is entitled to rely on what's on file down at the New Orleans conveyance office and under Mr. Stern's theory would not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.330" offset="12807515">Stability of titles is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.293" offset="12815351">I will note that there was no adversary proceeding under Rule 7001 in the bankruptcy court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.147" offset="12838861">This is an argument that we made below to suggest that the matter was not in fact actually litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.520" offset="12860282">We didn't even have a cause of action at the date of the bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.443" offset="12875955">Not only were two of our people not there, we didn't even have any cause of action because the Browns had not attempted to pass title in derogation of our mortgage at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.239" offset="12911168">The bank had not let its right to enforce the erasure order expire of that time... at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.562" offset="12932484">There was no... our loan was not in default at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.913" offset="12941888">We were not claimants in the bankruptcy proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.595" offset="12952651">This was a balloon payment, a one time balloon payment that was not mature at the time of the bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.429" offset="12975952">In fact, the loan had been made on it shortly before the bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.401" offset="12987864">The obligation sued upon is, in fact, a new post bankruptcy obligation due to the written waiver of prescription which we say, under State law, constitutes a novation.</text>
