            <text syncTime="18.430" offset="227139">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="24.646" offset="252008">This case raises the issue left open in Bailey v. United States, what it means to carry a firearm under 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="34.205" offset="290251">Petitioner submits that for four principal reasons carries a firearm means, bears a firearm on one's person.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.655" offset="320031">First, the plain meaning of the phrase, carries a firearm, directly supports petitioner's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.919" offset="345108">Dictionaries repeatedly and consistently equate carries a firearm with having a firearm on the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.088" offset="369768">Second, the Government has not cited a single dictionary that defines the phrase, carries a firearm, to mean transporting or possessing a firearm in a vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.647" offset="408011">Instead, the Government improperly isolates the word carry, rather than looking at the specific context, carries a firearm, but although the term carry has multiple definitions, this Court has made clear in Deal v. United States and elsewhere that when a dictionary offers multiple definitions, all but one of those meanings is ordinarily eliminated by context.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.996" offset="497454">Here, the context is carries a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.121" offset="505918">Third, the Government's view would make carries a firearm the same as transporting a firearm, but section 924(b) and numerous other gun provisions use the word transport, showing that Congress knew how to get across the concept of transport when it wanted to.</text>
