            <text syncTime="17.424" offset="222469">The issue for consideration, in a nutshell, is whether it is lawful for an employer and a union to agree that the employer shall pay the wages of a union official, or union officials, for their services as union officials, where the union official used to be an employee of the payor employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.059" offset="324973">Our position is, is that under section 302 of the Labor Management Relations Act and a fair reading of the plain language of that statute, such an arrangement is clearly unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.530" offset="390802">This Court in Arroyo many years ago said that a literal reading of the language of the statute does no offense... does no violence, I believe the term was... to common sense and so I believe it is useful at the threshold to consider for a moment what common sense would suggest is the answer to the question in light of what we all know to be bedrock Federal labor policy and that is, is that notwithstanding the fact that ultimately there is an economic interdependence between labor and management, that the relationship is to be maintained as one of adversarial independence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2879.273" offset="11669848">These are much more categorical exceptions which bespeak an effort to pull the entire area outside of the ambit of this criminal statute and leave it for treatment under other law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2913.067" offset="11804954">First, that we know that this... in 1947 those who were making these changes were not at all shy about saying this practice that's going on today in collective bargaining is illegal, it's illegitimate, we're trying to change it, and they made that very clear about a number of types of collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.680" offset="11879455">They said nothing to suggest that this practice was something they were trying to reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.231" offset="11897636">Perhaps even more important, at the very same time that Congress did that, they enacted the changes to section 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act to provide essentially a rule of equality whose purpose, the legislative history tells us, was precisely to allow company unions the same privilege that unions like the UAW already enjoyed under the law to negotiate for lost time arrangements of this sort.</text>
