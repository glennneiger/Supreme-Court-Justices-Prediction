            <text syncTime="892.262" offset="3698095">One of the questions that I had, and I had it even after reading Tinker, was whether there was redundancy in the statute unless I read it your way, and I decided that there wasn't redundancy in the statute and this is the way I worked it out, and you tell me whether I'm wrong, or whether Tinker is inconsistent with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.539" offset="3795271">It's got to be willful and malicious.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.382" offset="3810631">We start, I guess, with the definition of malicious as the act whose purpose is to harm the third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.310" offset="3858278">I don't suppose willful adds anything to that sense of malicious.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.952" offset="3876878">You can't be any worse than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.504" offset="3883147">But there's also a sense of malicious in which, although you do not personally have a purpose or an animus to hurt the victim, what you do inevitably will hurt the victim, and I think that's what was going on in Tinker.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.443" offset="3946886">In that sense of malicious, the word willful does add something, because if you take willful there to mean, he knows it's going to hurt the other person, he knows the inevitability of it and he does it anyway, knowing that that will be the consequence, that, then, as it were, jacks up the moral reprehensibility, the seriousness of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.052" offset="4057331">So in the weaker sense of malicious, willful adds something, and I thought that was consistent with Tinker.</text>

            <text syncTime="2108.497" offset="8563036">No, I don't, Your Honor, but as a policy reason, if the State was concerned that this Court's ruling would have some effect to cause doctors to not carry malpractice insurance, they could govern that by licensing it within their own States and requiring insurance, just as in... most States are now requiring, or several States are requiring insurance in order to have a driver's license.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.753" offset="8652061">Dr. Geiger, as found by the bankruptcy court, had several reasons for his treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.739" offset="8696051">He in prescribing various types of medicine at all times 1) believed his patient was getting better, 2) thought he was... she had the ability to absorb medicine very well through her stomach, which is why he made the various choices he made, thought her infection had burned out, and thought she had developed a superinfection in determining to stop using antibiotics altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.701" offset="8767940">So even if you were to take the definition of malice as set forth in the Tinker case, Dr. Geiger would have just cause or excuse for having done what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.527" offset="8811199">The legislative history also supports this by looking at the language to the extent other cases have relied on Tinker to hold a reckless disregard standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.914" offset="8848711">There, the courts once again are focus... or Congress is focusing on the intent of the injury itself, because a reckless act would be one that would not require intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.830" offset="8884446">Within the section 500 of the Restatement is the definition of recklessness and within that subsection (f) of that definition there's a comparison of intentional misconduct to recklessness and, when you compare the two, recklessness does not require an intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.164" offset="8969710">That's why we feel reckless conduct, which the Eighth Circuit said at the very worst his conduct was reckless, it would be dischargeable because there's... you don't have the element of intent in a reckless type of act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.554" offset="9015268">Tinker we... I do not believe is in conflict with the decision of the Eighth Circuit, because most of the examples in Tinker appear to require an intent to injure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.861" offset="9064482">The implied malice standard is limited to certain facts in certain situations and Tinker certainly does not support a reckless disregard standard, so the legislative history is not overruling Tinker but basically saying, read Tinker correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.630" offset="9115578">The purposes and policy of the Bankruptcy Code will be furthered by the decision of the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.416" offset="9154762">This is because the purpose of the Bankruptcy Code overall is to provide a debtor with a fresh start and that is why exceptions to discharge are narrowly reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.812" offset="9188303">The... requiring an intent to cause an injury would lead to such a narrow interpretation and enhance the fresh starts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.546" offset="9219232">Intentional act, if you only require that which results in injury, would lead to virtually everything being nondischargeable, as pointed out by the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.053" offset="9257266">If you speed up to a yellow light because you're in a hurry to pick someone up, that would be an intentional act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.216" offset="9277955">It would be nondischargeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.107" offset="9281508">If you're driving too fast for conditions, even though you're driving within the speed limit, that would be an intentional act which would be nondischargeable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2304.850" offset="9348486">Once again, Justice Peckham's example of driving into a crowded thoroughfare would be an intentional act under that definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.956" offset="9384953">We feel the policies and the purpose of the Bankruptcy Code are furthered by this Court deeming that the decision of the Eighth Circuit was correct and affirming that decision.</text>
