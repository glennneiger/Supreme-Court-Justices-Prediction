            <text syncTime="1733.534" offset="7062856">And what they were able to do in 1991, that they were able to do specifically because of section 1640, is they were able to get actual compensatory damages and they were able to get statutory damages, in point of fact, even though the statute of limitations on violations of TILA had already run, and that's because Congress was very careful in devising the remedial scheme that it adopted here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1775.444" offset="7230562">Under these circumstances, where you've received full recompense, what sense does it make for Congress to go further and ask you to grant a right of rescission, and the petitioners say that we have to find something in the statute that says you cannot have a right of rescission, and we submit to you that the more reasonable assessment of the equities of the relationship between the parties is, we ought to be looking in this statute for some evidence that a right of rescission in recoupment should exist under the circumstances of this case.</text>
