            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text>We'll hear argument now in Number 96-779, Arkansas Educational Television Commission v. Ralph Forbes.</text>
            <text>Mr. Marks.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard D. Marks</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>The issue in this case is whether the State of Arkansas may establish the Arkansas Educational Television Network as an institution of the press, insulated by policy, structure, and tradition from State political pressure.</text>
            <text>The issue is important to viewers across the country who depend on public television to select and deliver information, particularly so in political elections but, of course, at other times, too, and this case does not extend just to political debates, because if the decision below stands, its rationale will not only result in fewer debates and less coverage of politics, but it will extend to other programs of a controversial nature where the trustworthiness of public television editors will be questioned because they are employees of the State.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, I think not necessarily.</text>
            <text>It all depends on the analysis that we follow, and you have to ask whether this is closer to a situation of the State speaking, as such, or a situation of letting candidates speak.</text>
            <text>I mean, it may fall on one or the other side of the line.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_d_marks">
            <label>Mr. Richard D. Marks</label>
            <text>Your Honor, I agree that the rationale that the Court uses will, of course, affect the scope of the decision, but I think that it's clear from the record whether we deal with a public forum doctrine rationale or whether we deal with a structural rationale based on League of Women Voters.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>I assume here that the station was intending to let the candidates speak.</text>
            <text>The station wasn't trying to put words in their mouths.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_d_marks">
            <label>Mr. Richard D. Marks</label>
            <text>That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>In this case we are not talking about State speech.</text>
            <text>We are--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>No, and did the station set in advance here the rules that it eventually came up with when there was a third candidate?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_d_marks">
            <label>Mr. Richard D. Marks</label>
            <text>--Your Honor, the rules--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>When it opened... when it first decided to have the debate, as I understand it, it just said we're going to let the candidates for this office come here and have a debate.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_d_marks">
            <label>Mr. Richard D. Marks</label>
            <text>--Not exactly, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>In fact, I think that that is not a full enough characterization of the record.</text>
            <text>What the State decided here was to hold a debate that would best serve the interests of its viewers, and the record reflects that the editors went through an elaborate analysis.</text>
            <text>Ms. Oliver did an elaborate investigation and reported to Ms. Howarth, the editor-in-chief of the Arkansas network, about those candidates who were newsworthy, and it is--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>I thought that occurred after this third party candidate appeared and said, I want to talk, too.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_d_marks">
            <label>Mr. Richard D. Marks</label>
            <text>--No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>In fact, when the debate discussion started, which was sometime in the spring of 1992, there was a discussion, and it's reflected in the testimony that we had at trial, about how the debates would be structured and about their rationale, and the purpose from the beginning was to provide the citizens of Arkansas with a... an opportunity to hear the views of those candidates who were going to be the ones they were going to be voting for, who had, in the words of the witnesses, a serious chance, who were demonstrating popular support by virtue of any number of factors.</text>
            <text>Now, certainly--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, I thought that was what emerged eventually in response to the request of Mr. Forbes to participate, but was that laid out in all its complexity at the outset?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_d_marks">
            <label>Mr. Richard D. Marks</label>

          <turn speaker="richard_d_marks">
            <label>Mr. Richard D. Marks</label>
            <text>--complexity, no, Your Honor, but what... but the early discussions between Amy Oliver and Bill Simmons, the chief of the Associated Press in Arkansas, concentrated on whom to invite.</text>
            <text>Now, when they issued the invitations the only candidates who were on the list to be invited were ballot-qualified candidates, and they were in each district the Republican and the Democratic candidates, so when the original decision was made, the only candidates who could be invited were the major party candidates.</text>
            <text>Mr. Forbes qualified on August 17 of 1992, and his letter was August 24, but even before that, Your Honor, the policies that AETN has adopted, the policy on editorial integrity, the programming policy which incorporates the principles of editorial integrity, set out for Ms. Howarth what would be her basis for decision.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, I assume that this decision was parallel to what a private network would do with a similar debate in a similar format.</text>
            <text>Is that in the record, or do I just judicially know that, or is that important for the case, or--</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_d_marks">
            <label>Mr. Richard D. Marks</label>
            <text>Your Honor, I think that there are enough cases... the Chisolm case, the Henry Geller decision at the FCC... so that in fact from those cases the Court can take judicial notice that this is a typical structure for debates.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>--Well, I mean, other stations, privately owned stations can surely do things that your station is not allowed to.</text>
            <text>Could your station endorse a candidate?</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_d_marks">
            <label>Mr. Richard D. Marks</label>
            <text>No, Your Honor, because of section 399 of the Communications Act.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Let's assume that's not there.</text>
            <text>As a constitutional matter, would your station be able to endorse a particular candidate for public office?</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>I mean, I know it's not this case.</text>
            <text>I'm asking you, if 399 were not there, would your... would a publicly owned station as a constitutional matter be able to endorse a political candidate?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_d_marks">
            <label>Mr. Richard D. Marks</label>
            <text>--Under forum doctrine the answer is no, because I think to do that--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Under forum... I'm not talking about creating a forum.</text>
            <text>I'm just talking about a publicly owned station that comes out and says we endorse, you know, the Republican or the Democratic candidate for this district.</text>
            <text>Now, a private broadcaster can certainly do that, can he not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_d_marks">
            <label>Mr. Richard D. Marks</label>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="richard_d_marks">
            <label>Mr. Richard D. Marks</label>
            <text>I think this public broadcaster under these policies, the principles of editorial integrity and AETN's programming policy, this public broadcaster could not do that and stay within the bounds of the policy--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>--Well, I would be interested in hearing you answer Justice Scalia's question, which you haven't done yet.</text>
            <text>If the station wished to endorse a candidate, could it have done so under the Constitution, without regard to any statutory provision?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_d_marks">
            <label>Mr. Richard D. Marks</label>
            <text>--Mr. Chief Justice, I think that the answer to Justice Scalia's question would depend on whether that would be considered invidious discrimination, and I don't think there's any precedent on it, but my belief is that it would be.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Under the... some equal--</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_d_marks">
            <label>Mr. Richard D. Marks</label>
            <text>Sure, under an equal protection theory.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>--protection doctrine, or the First Amendment?</text>
            <text>That they couldn't do it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_d_marks">
            <label>Mr. Richard D. Marks</label>
            <text>Could not.</text>
            <text>Could not, because I think that the... I think, Justice Scalia, that there are limits on what a State-owned broadcaster can do.</text>
            <text>I think those bounds are set by invidious discrimination--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, to tie that in to where we were before I asked the question, the mere fact that you're using standards that a private broadcaster would use, and that you're doing nothing more than what a, you know, a private station would do, you're not behaving in a politically biased manner, you're just behaving like a good broadcaster, that doesn't help your case, because there are some things that private broadcasters can do that you can't do, and maybe this is one of them.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_d_marks">
            <label>Mr. Richard D. Marks</label>
            <text>--I think, Your Honor, that there's a great difference between endorsing a candidate and having the State come down that way.</text>
            <text>I think it's an equal protection issue at the very least.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, I think that... I'm not sure about that, but can your answer be, and could we look at this case as saying that we look at different programs to determine what the First Amendment rules are, and we look on a program by program basis, or do the same rules have to apply to every part of the station's ownership, management, and control in broadcasting, i.e., hypothetical about endorsement, hypothetical whether you can hire all Democrats or all Republicans for the editorial board and so forth?</text>
            <text>We look at the precise function that's in question, i.e., the conduct of debate.</text>
            <text>Is... would that be a way to answer Justice Scalia's question, and would that be an adequate... is there adequate precedent for us to decide this case on that sort of analysis?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_d_marks">
            <label>Mr. Richard D. Marks</label>
            <text>The answer to the second question is yes, and the answer to the first question is yes.</text>
            <text>Each one of these situations, each one of these questions about whether a particular program satisfies this Court's precedent, is a two-level analysis.</text>
            <text>First you've got to analyze the intent of AETC in delegating to Ms. Howarth the editorial discretion within the bounds of these policies, and Justice Scalia, these policies do bound her in a way that a private broadcaster is not bound, because they require her to consider credibility and fairness and balance and accuracy and objectivity, and a private broadcaster is not bound that way.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Don't you think private broadcasters might think those elements were desirable, or--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_d_marks">
            <label>Mr. Richard D. Marks</label>
            <text>I think most broadcasters would find them desirable and, indeed, Mr. Chief Justice, the intent of adopting the principles of editorial integrity was to allow the public broadcaster to walk this very difficult line of needing to satisfy the requirements of the First Amendment as the foundation requirement, but at the same time being able to satisfy the requirement in the Communications Act that it control all its programming, because they're--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>--Being responsible wouldn't allow you to endorse one of the candidates for the office even if you had criteria, we will not endorse any candidate unless, and you set out the criteria.</text>
            <text>It may be very responsible.</text>
            <text>It may be very objective, even, but that doesn't prove that the Government can do it, the mere fact that it's objective and responsible.</text>
            <text>You wouldn't allow an endorsement of a candidate to proceed on that basis.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard D. Marks</label>
            <text>--Well, Your Honor, in this case... I understand that the question is a, if I understand it correctly, a polar question for analytical purposes, but this case has a record, and there are distinct policies here, and there is elaborate testimony--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text>He was an ineffective candidate.</text>
            <text>His efforts to fit a place in the market space were feeble, he was not generating public support, and for that reason Ms. Howarth concluded that his appearance would not serve her audience, and for that reason it was her position that he did not fit the criteria to be included.</text>

          <turn speaker="kelly_j_shackelford">
            <label>Ms. Kelly J. Shackelford</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>I'm going to take about 30 seconds and put this in context.</text>
            <text>In 1990, Ralph Forbes running for lieutenant governor received 47 percent of the State-wide vote in the Republican primary.</text>
            <text>That vote included carrying 15 of 16 counties which comprised the Third Congressional District.</text>
            <text>So, 2 years later, he ran for the Third Congressional District.</text>
            <text>He obtained thousands of signatures and met the State's standard for a candidate's seriousness and qualified as one of three candidates on the ballot.</text>
            <text>Days later, an unelected Government official summarily declared him a frivolous candidate and banned him from its debate for that very seat.</text>
            <text>The Government therefore today asks this Court to give it unfettered discretion to pick and choose amongst candidates, and confer powerful Government benefits on those it chooses, to the detriment of their opponents.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Shackelford, one of the suggestions that's been raised is that if in fact the State is limited in what it can do here, the State will be limited in what it can do almost universally throughout its broadcasting, including news broadcasts and so on.</text>
            <text>What's your answer to this slippery slope?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kelly_j_shackelford">
            <label>Ms. Kelly J. Shackelford</label>
            <text>I think it's completely inaccurate.</text>
            <text>I understand the Government's attempt to widen this to all programs, but a debate, a candidate debate sponsored by the Government is a particularized and very unique event.</text>
            <text>It has aspects which really do not apply to any other forum.</text>
            <text>For instance, number 1, it involves not just speech, but core political speech that this Court has said is the apex of protection under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text>Secondly--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, a news... I... all right.</text>
            <text>You get your list out.</text>
            <text>Then I have a question.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kelly_j_shackelford">
            <label>Ms. Kelly J. Shackelford</label>
            <text>--Second--</text>
            <text>[Laughter]</text>
            <text>--it involves... this is I think one of the most important.</text>
            <text>It involves more than speech.</text>
            <text>In this context a candidate debate involves the idea that the Government can... that Government can interpose itself in an election process, possibly skewing the debate and possibly affecting the outcome of the election, and third, it is made by its very nature for candidates, it's intending to present them to the public without going through the normal sieve of editorial control of media or third parties.</text>
            <text>And then lastly, it is a contest, and the reason you will watch these debates is because of the face-to-face synergy and dynamics of the debates.</text>
            <text>There are a number of factors--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>May I just interrupt with this one question?</text>
            <text>Wouldn't all those considerations also apply to a policy of interviewing people on a Sunday news program where you want to ask them what they think of the latest bombing over in some place?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kelly_j_shackelford">
            <label>Ms. Kelly J. Shackelford</label>
            <text>--I don't think so.</text>
            <text>Number 1, we would not be talking about the election process.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>No, right before the election the only people they want to interview, what do the candidates... what do these two leading candidates think about this national issue that's just suddenly hit the headlines?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kelly_j_shackelford">
            <label>Ms. Kelly J. Shackelford</label>
            <text>I think that's certainly different, because it wouldn't be the situation with the candidate debates, where the purpose is actually for them to present themselves to the public and essentially--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, they certainly would run to the station just for that very reason.</text>
            <text>They'd want people to look at them and hear what they have to say about this, because they want to get votes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kelly_j_shackelford">
            <label>Ms. Kelly J. Shackelford</label>
            <text>--But the purpose of... assuming this is a Government station, the purpose of the station would be to create a debate where candidates are presenting themselves and trying to influence the voters' viewpoint.</text>
            <text>The purpose of the Government station in that limited part of the program would simply be--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, but the purpose here was not just a wide-open debate, as I understand it.</text>
            <text>It was a very structured thing.</text>
            <text>The candidate... each candidate wasn't given just 15 minutes to do what you want to, but the questions asked by reporters, the time for opening was limited, and that sort of thing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kelly_j_shackelford">
            <label>Ms. Kelly J. Shackelford</label>
            <text>--Yes, but for instance the candidates were given an open microphone at the beginning and the end to express their views.</text>
            <text>After each question, they were given full rein to answer those questions.</text>
            <text>There was no editing of the words as they came out of their mouths by the Government.</text>
            <text>This was really not just a forum, it was actually part of the definition that this Court's given for what a forum is.</text>
            <text>In Cornelius and Perry and a number of cases, this Court in describing what a forum is, has said it's public property, open quote, for assembly or debate.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But one of the problems in applying that kind of forum analysis here is this.</text>
            <text>If we're dealing with... take the easy example, the traditional public forum, the street corner where the soap boxes are, basically it's a matter of no concern whatever to the process whether one person shows up with a soap box or 200 show up with a soap box and just sort of shout at each other in a cacophony, but that does legitimately matter if we're talking about a TV debate, and I guess I have two questions.</text>
            <text>Number 1 is, is it... are you going to take the position, to be consistent, that there can be no limitation on the number of candidates, and if the answer to that is no, then what is your criterion for selection?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kelly_j_shackelford">
            <label>Ms. Kelly J. Shackelford</label>
            <text>We have not taken that position.</text>
            <text>The position we have taken is that the Government cannot subjectively pick and choose amongst the candidates.</text>
            <text>We agree that objective and constitutional criteria, such as the ballot access laws, are appropriate, and therefore we're not saying that no standards would be allowed.</text>
            <text>They could even, for instance, simply draw the names out of a hat.</text>
            <text>For that at least would be Government neutrality.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, how about a State where the write-in procedure is very simple, and someone who is perhaps defeated in a primary is going to run as a write-in, and his name is Willy Wacko, and he's regarded as a total loser by all political observers.</text>
            <text>Do they have to give him access?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kelly_j_shackelford">
            <label>Ms. Kelly J. Shackelford</label>
            <text>No, Your... Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think they do.</text>
            <text>Again, you have an objective standard, set in place beforehand, a ballot access law.</text>
            <text>That's perfectly allowed, but this Court's ballot access decisions, what the Court has said is, it's okay to ensure a modicum of support.</text>
            <text>However, the Court has never said that the Government can subjectively pick and choose--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, you want something more than--</text>
            <text>--You're saying that the same standard applies when you're talking about ballots, State regulation of ballots, as applies in this situation where you're talking about a State-operated--</text>

            <label>Ms. Kelly J. Shackelford</label>
            <text>--Certainly the dangers are very similar, in that we have Government, if they're allowed to subjectively interpose themselves into the election process, whether it's affecting the debate and what personal issues can be discussed by the candidates, or whether it is affecting, you know, the ballot, it has serious consequences.</text>

            <text>It would be quite objective to say the two parties that got the most votes in the last election will be the candidates that we'll interview.</text>

            <text>What this Court has set out saying... under the ballot access cases saying that a modicum of support is all right, but what you can't do is simply pick a particular party and attempt, as the Government, to entrench those parties and throw out--</text>

            <text>I just finally understood this last night.</text>
            <text>What the Government is actually doing here is, they are putting as their limit to a limited forum a subjective determination.</text>
            <text>That allows them to create a forum and then later when particular speakers arise to enter the forum, they use their subjective decisionmaking to exclude them.</text>

            <text>--Right.</text>
            <text>Certainly what they have here is not sufficient for Government broadcasting.</text>
            <text>The FCC has made clear its approach is to give unfettered discretion to all of its broadcasters, and so essentially what we have in the question is... and I think the context we have is, a broadcasting industry is a Government monopoly which is run by the FCC.</text>
            <text>Two-thirds of the licenses given out are given out to Government licensees.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>--But I'm concerned that what you're asking in this case is for us to confine editorial discretion in a corporate broadcasting station, and I suppose you'd be quite satisfied, because you could win your case, if we said that we will confine that discretion when elections are involved.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But I'm not sure if there is a principled line in our precedent that will allow us to make that conclusion, or you to make that argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kelly_j_shackelford">
            <label>Ms. Kelly J. Shackelford</label>
            <text>--I think there is, in that there are aspects in this particularized forum that do not exist in any other forum, and therefore it has to extrapolate from this type of forum to a forum that does involve elections, that does involve candidates.</text>
            <text>We would be in a completely different analysis... it may involve speech elements, but it wouldn't involve other voter's rights elements.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And yet in one sense editorial discretion is most important when we are involved with elections.</text>

          <turn speaker="kelly_j_shackelford">
            <label>Ms. Kelly J. Shackelford</label>
            <text>Well, certainly not in Government editorial discretion, in the way it interposes itself into the election process, possibly skews the debates.</text>
            <text>For instance, excluding minority candidates has more than one effect.</text>
            <text>Maybe that minority candidate is going to be our Congressman in 2 months.</text>
            <text>Maybe they're going to change the election as well for some of the other candidates, or I think the most important, maybe the ideas they express are going to be the ones around which the entire campaign is focused.</text>
            <text>So if we allow this type of discretion in excluding minority candidates, it will be a direct attack on the whole idea of--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>You know, except that I think at the same time you are agreeing that if the Government station decides instead of having a debate simply to have an interview by its political news anchor, it can choose to interview anyone it wants to.</text>
            <text>Is that your position?</text>

            <label>Ms. Kelly J. Shackelford</label>

            <label>Ms. Kelly J. Shackelford</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>So what you're really saying is, the Government up to a point sets its own terms.</text>
            <text>If the Government says, we're going to bring people before you so that you can hear them, then they are bound by something like forum analysis.</text>
            <text>If they don't say that, and they say, in essence, we're going to bring people before you whom we like, we endorse, it's not bound by forum analysis?</text>

            <label>Ms. Kelly J. Shackelford</label>
            <text>--What I'm saying is, there's a line, and I don't know that I can draw the line exactly between when it leaves Government speech and becomes a nonpublic forum.</text>
            <text>I think when they begin to involve private speakers, that is the first time the First Amendment might begin to come into play, but certainly when they get as far across the line as they are in the current case, with a candidate-Government debate, it is very clearly a limited public forum, and I don't think there will be any question about that.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Shackelford, suppose the Court were to determine that the standards that Ms... whatever, that those were all okay standards, the problem was that she made them up, or came up with them after, and that under those standards your candidate would flunk, so you're in this at this point for the money because the election is long over, would you be entitled to any relief if the standards that she announced are okay, the only problem with them was that they weren't in place when your candidate asked to be part of the debate?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kelly_j_shackelford">
            <label>Ms. Kelly J. Shackelford</label>
            <text>I think we would still be entitled to relief.</text>
            <text>Because, a good example was the Southeastern Productions case.</text>
            <text>In that case, the play had already been declared obscene in a criminal action, and so, but then the Court didn't even get to that issue.</text>
            <text>What they said was, use of unfettered discretion itself is enough of a constitutional violation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard D. Marks</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>Ballot qualification is, is an arbitrary standard.</text>
            <text>It's both over-and under-inclusive, and it simply wouldn't work.</text>
            <text>That's why editorial judgment is an essential element in this enterprise.</text>
            <text>You can't run a news organization without engaging in editorial discretion.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>How about standards like for public financing?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_d_marks">
            <label>Mr. Richard D. Marks</label>
            <text>I think, Your Honor, that the public financing standards that the FC, the FEC, Federal Elections Commission has asked for, even though their objectives are--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Is editorial discretion... can it be subject to objective standards?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_d_marks">
            <label>Mr. Richard D. Marks</label>
            <text>--No, Your Honor, it can't.</text>
            <text>It has to... the problem, Justice Ginsburg with your... with relying on Federal Election Commission standards, because any time there's a list of standards, there's going to be a weighing and balancing, and it will be subject to some subjectivity in that mix.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But don't you think that there's a guarantee present when you see the list, and you say, okay, I have to meet this list, then when there is no list, and then after they turn you down they say, these are the reasons?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_d_marks">
            <label>Mr. Richard D. Marks</label>
            <text>No, Your Honor, I don't.</text>
            <text>This is not an algorithm, and using the newsworthiness standard there's always an opportunity, if somebody doesn't want to use the newsworthiness standard, wants to discriminate, there's always opportunity to manipulate those factors.</text>
            <text>In fact, in answer to Justice Breyer's question about the FCC's standards that have been quoted here, because those standards in fact in the second prong of the test for an exemption forbid viewpoint discrimination.</text>
