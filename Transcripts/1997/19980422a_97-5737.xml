            <label>Mr. Ralph Wilborn</label>
            <text syncTime="50.175" offset="353350">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="54.097" offset="369024">This case raises the issue of whether or not a Social Security benefits claimant may appeal a final judgment entered under the fourth sentence of 42 U.S. Code 405(g) when that final judgment is accompanied by an order of remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.537" offset="438823">Now, in Finkelstein, which is cited in the briefs, this Court held that such a judgment is a final judgment which terminates the civil action, and that the agency, not the claimant, may appeal therefrom.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.946" offset="496501">In fact, in a footnote in Finkelstein this Court expressly reserved addressing whether or not the claimant had the right to appeal from such a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.132" offset="525236">This case squarely presents that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.045" offset="540910">Apart from Finkelstein, in Schaefer, also cited in the briefs, this Court construed, in the context of an Equal Access to Justice Act claim, the same statute without qualifying it in terms of whether the petitioner... the judgment was final for the Social Security Administration only.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.719" offset="623561">We believe that the plain language of the statute and the text and structure of the statute established that either party may appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.543" offset="654803">In fact, if you look at amicus' brief which was invited by the Court their entire argument, or all of their arguments ultimately loop back to the point or the misconception that petitioner can later appeal any aspect of the instant district court case following the remand proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.748" offset="743620">In other words, they're trying to tie that into the idea that the petitioner is not aggrieved currently.</text>

            <text syncTime="159.215" offset="789491">Mr. Chief Justice, yes, that is exactly my position.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.938" offset="800462">I do not believe that, under the way the statute is worded that we would have, the petitioner would have the right to appeal the current civil... or the current administrative finding.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.405" offset="846333">Suppose we think this would work in... just in the way... you have a new trial, and so you're not able to bring up... let's say you're the verdict winner.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.662" offset="891368">You're not able to bring up the errors in your favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.626" offset="907146">All the interlocutory rulings of the district court are preserved when you can't appeal them immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.050" offset="932851">Either... if you can't appeal them, isn't that the ordinary rule in civil procedure?</text>
            <text syncTime="200.382" offset="954167">It's a question of not never, but later.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ralph Wilborn</label>
            <text syncTime="204.366" offset="970154">Justice Ginsburg, yes, that is absolutely correct as far as ordinary civil procedure as it applies to interlocutory orders of remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.311" offset="1005889">In this case, however, the statute gives us a final judgment, and it then... sentence 8 of the statute... by the way, the statute is set out in full--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="222.939" offset="1044446">It says, shall be final except that it shall be appealable as normal judgments are, so you might say, well... if it hadn't been for Finkelstein, at least, you might say, well, it's final for purposes of attorney's fees.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="236.516" offset="1098781">But with reference to appeal it's subject to the same rule as any other judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.410" offset="1118320">That's a possible interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.183" offset="1129396">Finkelstein runs against that.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Ralph Wilborn</label>
            <text syncTime="248.814" offset="1147891">Yes, that's absolutely right, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.937" offset="1160430">Finkelstein does run against that, and it's interesting and I think significant that in Finkelstein this Court chose not to adopt the collateral doctrine rule set out in the Cohen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.764" offset="1203688">Instead, it directly interpreted the language of the statute as giving it final--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="267.538" offset="1222810">But Mr. Wilborn, Finkelstein could have been a now or never, as the Court pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.210" offset="1241514">That is, if the Commissioner the next time around, in this proceeding where he's hemmed in, makes a determination in the claimant's favor, then he can't appeal from his own order.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ralph Wilborn</label>
            <text syncTime="287.882" offset="1304208">--That is correct, Justice Ginsburg, and we believe we are in a similarly situated profile here.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.345" offset="1338062">Just as it was possible that the Secretary in Finkelstein might never have the opportunity to appeal that, or would lack standing if they paid benefits on remand, it is possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.853" offset="1384142">Now, it was also possible that the Secretary could have actually denied benefits on remand and then come up to Federal court to relitigate that issue, so it was possible that the Secretary--</text>

            <text syncTime="319.501" offset="1430640">That I don't understand, because if the court says, Secretary, remodify and remand, that's a marching order for the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.148" offset="1469301">The Secretary has no choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.560" offset="1474944">You're suggesting that the Secretary should not do what the court said the first time around?</text>

            <text syncTime="337.035" offset="1500857">What I'm suggesting is that even had the Secretary complied with the district court's order in Finkelstein, it is possible that the facts could have still allowed the Secretary, even construing the regulations against their wishes, to have denied the case, and if they had denied the claim in Finkelstein, that would have preserved the issue to come back--</text>

            <label>Mr. Ralph Wilborn</label>
            <text syncTime="373.940" offset="1648397">--Mr. Chief Justice, the reason we believe we cannot appeal from an adverse decision following remand is because this section, 405(g), sentence 1, which grants jurisdiction to the district court to review the final judgment of the Secretary, or the Commissioner now, expressly limits the subsequent review in light of Finkelstein saying, this civil action, the judgment, the sentence 4 judgment terminates the civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.256" offset="1741706">It goes back on remand, and we must then file a new civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.859" offset="1760097">The findings change on remand, the law applicable to that finding, to those findings changes on remand, so when we come back up with a second final agency decision under sentence 1 of 405(g) we are not permitted to appeal anything except the new Secretary's, or Commissioner's final decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="423.554" offset="1846928">Why... let me ask you the question this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.559" offset="1866885">Why might it not be that your appeal from the district court action in the first appeal might simply in effect be held in abeyance till you go through your second civil action and appeal and if you're not satisfied there, at that point you can take everything up.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.022" offset="1952776">If you win on your first claim, then we forget what happens in the second civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.528" offset="1974823">If you lose on your first claim, then we go to see whether there's any error, the court of appeals goes to see whether there's any error in effect based on what happened on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.935" offset="2016410">Would that be possible, or does Finkelstein stand in the way of that?</text>

            <text syncTime="836.634" offset="3499225">There are two requirements that must be met for a party to appeal a district court's judgment under section 1291.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.638" offset="3523257">First, the judgment must be final and, second, the party must be aggrieved by the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.641" offset="3543215">As to finality, this Court concluded in both Schaefer and Finkelstein that under the fourth and eighth sentences of section 405(g) a district court's order of remand is a final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.387" offset="3586265">As to aggrievement, the district court's decision is partially favorable to petitioner to the extent that it sets aside the Commissioner's decision and it remands for further proceedings, but that judgment is unfavorable to petitioner to the extent that it denies her the outright reversal that she seeks, and that's a greater form of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.961" offset="3664528">Therefore, because petitioner is not a fully prevailing party she's aggrieved by the district court's judgment and has a statutory right of appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1826.116" offset="7457194">It says it's subject to review in the same manner as other judgments, and we think that the Roper case that was cited from this Court and numerous other cases have made clear that the appellate standing doctrine is one of the doctrines that is looked at in all cases to be sure that an appellant in fact is aggrieved, and that someone should not be appealing a decision, whether it's a final decision or a nonfinal decision, unless they are aggrieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.543" offset="7562833">And here, what is perhaps unique about this case is that under this statutory scheme you have a judgment that is labeled final, but in this situation, which is a very common situation under this statute... we understand from the Government that there are literally thousands of remands like this per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.416" offset="7638379">In this situation, while it is labeled a final judgment, it is nevertheless a matter that will proceed on a remand where, unlike Justice Breyer's hypothetical, where the claimant has the opportunity to obtain every bit of the relief they seek.</text>

            <text syncTime="1933.326" offset="7886020">But there is a line of cases such as Occidental Petroleum v. SEC, and some other cases we've cited, that provide an exception where the Government can appeal the remand if the matter is otherwise not susceptible to review by the Government, and that is actually the Finkelstein holding in an analogous situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.408" offset="7958327">So a so-called one-way right of appeal, where only the Government can appeal today, but the claimant has to wait and appeal after the remand, is a rule that is in place today with regard to administrative agency cases generally.</text>
