            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="53.435" offset="344175">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="56.628" offset="356922">Each of the six Federal employees in this case engaged in sanctionable employment-related misconduct and then knowingly and intentionally falsely denied the misconduct when questioned by agency investigators.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.458" offset="420243">The court below held, however, that as a matter of constitutional due process the Government, as employer, may not charge these employees with both misconduct and lying about the misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.657" offset="477086">Indeed, the court went beyond that to hold that an employee's deliberate falsification may not even be considered in determining the penalty for the separate underlying misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.676" offset="525151">There is nothing whatsoever in the Due Process Clause or anywhere else in the Constitution, for that matter, that prevents a Government agency from sanctioning an employee who deliberately lies in response to questions about employment misconduct, whether or not the employee is also sanctioned for the misconduct itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.310" offset="611669">When the Government acts as an employer, it has the right to demand that its employees respond honestly to work-related questions and to sanction them if they do not, just as all other employers do.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.069" offset="666735">Indeed, the Government has more reason to demand honesty from its employees, as they employ... as they enjoy a public trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.103" offset="698813">As this Court held in Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, the Government has a compelling interest in honest civil service.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.628" offset="732981">The holding of the Federal Circuit in this case imposes profound anomalies and perverse incentives.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.695" offset="765269">Wrongdoers who tell the truth are required under this holding to be punished just as severely as wrongdoers who then knowingly and intentionally lie about their misconduct when questioned by an investigator or a tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.886" offset="834023">An employee who is questioned about wrongdoing can be punished for lying about it if he didn't do any wrong, but if he did do wrong and lies about it, he can't be separately punished for lying about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.557" offset="892642">Under the Federal Circuit rule, a rational employee questioned about wrongdoing will always lie, since it's cost-free and perhaps he will fool or dissuade the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.334" offset="943737">He would be irrational to 'fess up and, indeed, I think it's fair to say that the consequences, that the rationale of the Federal Circuit's decision in this case goes beyond just what the individual agency can do and presumably would also prevent the Government in its sovereign capacity from making the false statements 1001 or, if their statements were under oath, for perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.494" offset="1064423">So we submit that the decision of the Federal Circuit in this case, which doesn't follow any decisions by this Court or any decisions by any other Federal court, is simply wrong as a matter of constitutional law.</text>

            <text syncTime="248.574" offset="1124713">General Waxman, just for purposes of discussion and not to indicate my view on what the Court's likely to do in the preceding case, but let's assume we recognize an exculpatory no doctrine, does that have any spillover effect in this situation?</text>

            <text syncTime="264.146" offset="1186989">Boy, the only spillover effect it could have, Justice O'Connor, would be if you found an exculpatory no doctrine required as a matter of constitutional law, because the argument in favor of the exculpatory no doctrine in every court that has adopted some form of it has done so as a matter of statutory construction, trying to define what Congress could have intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.500" offset="1284478">There's no statute at issue in this case that that could be read into.</text>

            <text syncTime="369.263" offset="1607456">First of all, in a number of the cases that are collected in this... before this Court, the false statements were written.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.628" offset="1636922">That is, the employee was given a list of questions, or a series of questions and provided written answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.612" offset="1656880">In other instances, the employees either repeated or made their lies after they were put under oath, so you can't characterize the Federal Circuit's decision in this case as somehow limited to an informal oral question by an investigator.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.322" offset="1723753">But even if you could, that might go to the question of whether the agency could establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the individual employee had knowingly and with intent to deceive given a false statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.142" offset="1791045">That is, it may make it more difficult for the agency to establish that the misconduct had occurred, but as a constitutional matter, I wouldn't think that any a priori rule would be appropriate.</text>
