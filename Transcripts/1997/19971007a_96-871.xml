            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="147071">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 96-871, State Oil Company v. Barkat U. Khan and Khan &amp; Associates.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.048" offset="195241">Mr. Baumgartner.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_baumgartner" startTime="13.480" stopTime="301.750">
            <label>Mr. John Baumgartner</label>
            <text syncTime="13.480" offset="200988">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.803" offset="214258">The Petitioner in this cause would like to accent three questions in this case this morning, if possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.748" offset="249993">First, that manufacturers and suppliers have a legitimate and competitive interest in the maximum prices which are charged by the people who carry their products.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.533" offset="289177">Second, that the rule in Albrecht actually hinders, rather than enhances, economic efficiency and competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.549" offset="325226">And, third, that the foundations of Albrecht were destroyed by the decisions in Sylvania and Arco.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.476" offset="356887">Unless a manufacturer or a supplier operates his own retail outlets, the only means he has for reaching consumers is through retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.941" offset="406833">And the activities of those retailers vitally affect the degree to which his products are sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.937" offset="434731">For instance, in this particular case, Khan sales were also State Oil sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.842" offset="458346">And State Oil had a legitimate business interest in seeing to it that those sales were handled in the most effective manner possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.468" offset="488857">Any action by Mr. Khan which reduced those sales also reduced State Oil's sales, income and profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.932" offset="526787">We believe that this is the incentive which a manufacturer or a wholesaler has when he attempts to introduce a maximum retail price.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.412" offset="580704">We also believe that the rule in Albrecht hinders, rather than supports, competition, and maximum economic efficiency, because it prevents manufacturers from ensuring that economic incentives offered at the wholesale level are passed on to the targeted consumers, who actually determine the competitive outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.579" offset="677357">For example, a dealer who wishes a price reduction, or a manufacturer who wishes to establish a price reduction, are unable to agree, at least to the degree of an enforceable arrangement, that this price reduction will be passed on to the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.620" offset="761471">And the supplier or the manufacturer is therefore discouraged from utilizing price reductions as a man... as a means of enhancing sales of his products.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.760" offset="806088">A dealer who wishes an exclusive territory, or a manufacturer who wishes to establish exclusive territories, are again discouraged from utilizing that means, because the manufacturer and the supplier are unable to obtain enforceable assurances that the dealer, or that some dealers, will not ultimately use that exclusive territory to be able to increase the price of the product which they're selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.449" offset="924789">In this case, when the price ceiling was ignored, the consumer who purchased premium gasoline paid a higher price for that gasoline, and the additional effect of an inability of the manufacturer, or the wholesaler, to limit the maximum price is that an increased price can be passed on to the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.406" offset="1028651">The only thing which the rule in Albrecht really encourages is vertical integration on the part of manufacturers and suppliers.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.042" offset="1067208">We further believe that the foundations of Albrecht were destroyed by the decisions in Sylvania and Arco.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.647" offset="1101585">The... Arco... Albrecht appears to be based on four concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.522" offset="1133141">Number one, an objection to restraints on alienation; a concern about the freedom of dealers; an objection to vertical restraints; and an objection to price restraints in any form.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.572" offset="1185282">Sylvania rejected the distinction between sales and non-sales transactions and, therefore, also rejected the concept of restraints on alienation.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.921" offset="1242751">In determining that some forms of vertical restraints were permissible and were not anti-competitive, Sylvania also rejected the concept of freedom of dealers as an antitrust concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.931" offset="1310774">This leaves as the only real foundation for Albrecht an objection to price restraints as such.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.893" offset="1374617">Are there some circumstances in which it's advantageous... and I won't say whether it's pro-competitive, but advantageous... to have dealers with substantial strength and substantial freedom?</text>

            <text syncTime="356.293" offset="1572207">Do you suggest that that case, Sylvania, totally rejected any interest in the independence of the dealer, such as, for example, fixing minimum prices?</text>
            <text syncTime="367.711" offset="1617869">Do you think that's at stake in this case?</text>

            <text syncTime="369.453" offset="1624870">I don't believe that minimum price fixing is at stake in this case, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.797" offset="1646186">As I understand Sylvania, Sylvania represents a switch from Albrecht in the sense of looking not at... in Albrecht the Court, I believe, looked at possible misuses of the activity in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.819" offset="1710343">And in Sylvania, the Court, rather than looking at possible misuses, looked to see whether the activity had potential pro-competitive effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.843" offset="1750362">My problem with the question of minimum price-fixing is that I'm not really in a... a position to express a worthwhile opinion on the pro-competitive aspects of minimum price-fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.004" offset="1806996">And, therefore, I'm not really expressing any opinion on it at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="426.113" offset="1851509">If the primary concern that remains from Albrecht is the question of price agreements as such, it's a recognized fact today that price agreements cannot be realistically lumped into one sole category.</text>

            <text syncTime="571.647" offset="2433621">And we believe that the supplier is discouraged from doing that because he's unable to obtain any sort of binding assurance that the dealer won't pass that reduction... or will pass that reduction on and won't simply regard it as money on the table which he can then use.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joel I. Klein</label>
            <text syncTime="888.959" offset="3702859">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="901.618" offset="3753536">Albrecht should be overruled because its doctrinal underpinnings have been eroded, and also because its perpetuation is likely to do considerably more competitive harm than good.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.603" offset="3801393">Per se rules are reserved for business practices that are manifestly, self-evidently, if not always, at least almost always, anti-competitive, whereas maximum resale price agreements are rarely in that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.577" offset="3869311">If anything, we submit, they are more likely to be pro-competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.318" offset="3888328">For example, as the Court express... expressly recognized in Arco, a maximum can constrain dealer market power, which is something that, in varying degrees, can exist from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.926" offset="3942767">These maximums also serve other important purposes relating to price, advertising and discounting, which is undermined by a per se rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.884" offset="3982578">I should add, as precedent, Albrecht has had an especially difficult time of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.877" offset="4006506">Its dealer autonomy and dealer multiplicity rationales were undermined in Sylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.852" offset="4030434">And I do think that that doesn't mean that a minimum falls.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.135" offset="4047571">The difference is that minimum resale price-fixing has entirely different effects and... both pro-competitive and anti-competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.790" offset="4078186">But it's not the abstract notion of dealer autonomy, Justice Stevens, that's critical here.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.182" offset="4099711">And I would dare say that Albrecht got a remarkably chilly reception in the Arco case.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.327" offset="4124371">The lower Federal courts have whittled away at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.850" offset="4138372">The commentators have been extraordinarily critical of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1001.232" offset="4151956">Mr. Klein, we have a brief here from 33 States and the Territory of Guam, saying don't get rid of Albrecht.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.087" offset="4191349">That's going to hurt our antitrust enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.770" offset="4206082">Now, would you like to comment on the position of the States?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joel_i_klein" startTime="1018.423" stopTime="1161.706">
            <label>Mr. Joel I. Klein</label>
            <text syncTime="1018.423" offset="4220710">I'd be... I'd be delighted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.475" offset="4224890">I... I think there are two things I'd like to say about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.706" offset="4233876">First of all, what's significant is that the States themselves don't cite a single instance, and we in the Federal Government could find no instances, where an enforcement agency brought a maximum case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.531" offset="4285180">And that seems to me to be very, very telling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.275" offset="4300122">That is, in the 30 years since Albrecht, none of them appear to have brought such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.740" offset="4317990">Second, their concern... if you read their briefs... their concern is, somehow, if you breach the wall in this pricing area, that you won't be able to stop at minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.427" offset="4364697">Now, I think minimum presents very different effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.908" offset="4374624">And in fact, their key argument is that maximum could be a minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.420" offset="4392700">But my answer to that is, if it is a minimum, it will be treated by a minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.895" offset="4410568">And, frankly, I don't see any problem in detection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.346" offset="4428436">The notion that somehow you could disguise this... after all, the first person who is likely to object is going to be the dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.542" offset="4457171">And if the dealer thinks that its price wants... he wants to drive his price down, he's entirely free to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.126" offset="4487473">And if he gets punished for that, then we know that it's a minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.468" offset="4500847">So this notion that it's undetectable seems to me to be a very hard one to sustain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.981" offset="4522895">Now, in addition, the only other arguments of maximum and minimum, which I think is the most telling thing about the States' brief, Justice O'Connor, is they really are fighting for another day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.910" offset="4562705">And if that day should come, entirely different competitive considerations will be at play.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.624" offset="4589559">But the other thing that's very telling about it, the only other argument you see in the briefs is that a maximum price could affect dealer service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.298" offset="4628220">Now, that... that... that's a reasonable concern, but I would say several things about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.792" offset="4646193">One, there's no reason to think that the manufacturer is not interested in dealer service that has a pro-competitive benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.176" offset="4675763">This Court recognized, in GTE, it recognized in Sharp, that manufacturers have an interest in order to maximize their profit in an efficient distribution system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.023" offset="4715156">Second, and it seems to me crucial, is that under the law now, after GTE/Sylvania, you can actually impose specific service limitations in your contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.991" offset="4763012">For example, McDonald's can say to all of its dealers: You can't have waiters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.785" offset="4786209">It destroys the ambience.</text>

            <text syncTime="1163.598" offset="4801360">In a fast-food restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.389" offset="4808570">They can condition a McDonald's franchise on that limitation on service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.512" offset="4825079">The... the... the manufacturer here, the gas State... gas company here could say: You can't wash windows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.977" offset="4858934">You can't do tires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.647" offset="4865621">They can put that in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.099" offset="4871368">Now, that may be anti-competitive ultimately, but it would be tested by a rule of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.643" offset="4885579">So the notion that we would have a per se rule, basically because it might impact service... a price restriction might impact service, seems to me to have the cart way before the horse in terms of what would go on, on a direct restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.592" offset="4945347">And, beyond that, those are the two generic circumstances: maximum/minimum and effect on service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.354" offset="4964469">Beyond that, the only other notion that comes up is a possibility of predation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.187" offset="4983799">And if there is predation, of course, that would be a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.969" offset="4994875">But the Court, in Brook and many other cases, has realized that that's quite rare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.721" offset="5009922">So the key point here is that this is not the stuff of which per se rules are made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.846" offset="5034372">Whether you could imagine a case is not the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.998" offset="5047015">If there is such a case and there's competitive effects, the rule of reason is there, as it is for virtually all business practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.053" offset="5071257">What the per se rule is reserved for, what it has its real currency in is practices that one ought to look at and say, this is really bad stuff; you don't need to do an in-depth examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.189" offset="5123815">Now, what's on the other side of the equation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.252" offset="5132070">First of all, you asked about exclusives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.393" offset="5140638">But it's not just exclusives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.585" offset="5145340">Look at the facts in Albrecht.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.265" offset="5152028">You can have, if you will, de facto market power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.657" offset="5165611">If you're a newspaper dealer, it's... it's really the case that you're going to have an area which you... you deliver these newspapers to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.311" offset="5196227">And unlike the newspaper company, the dealer might well say, look, I have some market power; people in Washington, D.C. want to wake up on a Saturday morning and see their newspaper there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.728" offset="5241889">I can charge more than a quarter for that, before they're going to go out to a machine or downtown or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.414" offset="5264668">And then the dealer can extract real monopoly profits in that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1386.412" offset="5692658">We're dealing with a statutory question, not a constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.677" offset="5709690">And, customarily, it takes a fairly strong case to get us to overrule a previous decision.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joel I. Klein</label>
            <text syncTime="1397.710" offset="5737902">I think that that's right, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.813" offset="5746261">I would say two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.282" offset="5752113">One, I think, as this Court has recognized, the standard under the antitrust law is a little different from many statutes, because it is a common law statute, in which this Court has revised and changed over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.171" offset="5803731">GTE/Sylvania said that, and the Court did as well in Copperweld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.704" offset="5821807">And I think it has recognized that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.516" offset="5829122">But I think, whatever standard you apply, it can be met here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.918" offset="5846676">I think if you look at GTE/Sylvania, you will see that the basic notions that animated the decision in... in Albrecht are no longer viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.616" offset="5889517">There was a view in the mid-eighties that actually animated Schwinn... in the mid-sixties, it animated Schwinn and animated Albrecht... that said there ought to be dealer autonomy; we ought to have lots and lots of dealers; that's better than a few dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.835" offset="5938313">The Court's opinion, quite clearly, eroded that thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.605" offset="5953464">Not only that, it created the very right to... to establish exclusives that Albrecht said was no good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.191" offset="5987737">Albrecht said, well, if you have market power because you have an exclusive territorial arrangement, then, under Schwinn, the territory falls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.257" offset="6023995">But now, post-GTE, the territory remains.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.981" offset="6042908">Then I think the next problem you have is the Court says in Arco... it... it... it's really an interesting opinion... it starts out by saying: We assume, arguendo, that Albrecht is still good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.078" offset="6095362">It then has a footnote saying: Albrecht was the only case ever that dealt with a pure maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.124" offset="6123469">And then it goes on, in footnote 13, and says: The pro-competitive benefits are now, quote, clearer than they were at the time of Albrecht.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.850" offset="6158369">And they cite a list of maybe 10 different academic articles, all of which are harshly critical of Albrecht for essentially mis-perceiving its competitive impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.947" offset="6202777">Then you look at what the lower courts have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.957" offset="6210823">They have constantly read the opinion narrowly, chipping away at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.101" offset="6231407">No antitrust injury, no injury in fact, no damages, no agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.156" offset="6255649">Cases involving discounts get distinguished in some sort of ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.568" offset="6273308">So this is anything but robust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.959" offset="6282816">This is, in... in Judge... Chief Judge Posner's words, a rather moth eaten foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.593" offset="6305386">And then the point which I would not discount... Justice Kennedy said there haven't been many such cases in minimum resale price maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.419" offset="6336733">The States cite a lot of cases they have brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.852" offset="6346451">The Antitrust Division has brought such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.733" offset="6353974">The Federal Trade Commission has brought such... such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.174" offset="6363691">These are real enforcement actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.385" offset="6372573">In the maximum area, there are no such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.678" offset="6385739">It's not because the practice doesn't occur; it's because government agencies don't find this to be a desirable enforcement vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.423" offset="6420743">And then I would just say the last point, to the extent congressional intent here is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.458" offset="6440805">Of course, in 1991, Congress actually attempted to pass... it ultimately failed, but a different statute passed both houses, trying to reverse this Court's decisions in Sharp and Monsanto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.656" offset="6493677">And while the ultimate statute never passed, Mr. Chief Justice, both statutes would have ensured... both... both bills... would have ensured that minimum resale price maintenance stayed a per se rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.574" offset="6545295">And they had exceptions for maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.566" offset="6557311">So, to the extent one can glint... glim... take anything from that congressional reaction, Congress, too, realized that Albrecht was no good.</text>

            <text syncTime="1627.772" offset="6658144">This is, in the end, a common law statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.023" offset="6671100">This Court, I believe, has the obligation to revise and change in this circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.439" offset="6696805">And the reason you should do it, most importantly, is I don't think you should strip manufacturers of a mechanism that is pro-competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.956" offset="6734839">If we leave it on the books, that is going to increase market injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1658.894" offset="6782591">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.798" offset="6806206">Current antitrust jurisprudence relies upon interbrand competition to guarantee the fundamental purpose of the antitrust laws: the protection and preservation of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.398" offset="6860645">What I find interesting in this case is that although cloaking themselves as champions of competition, their position... the Government and State Oil's position... really expresses a deep-seated distrust of interbrand competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.480" offset="6932952">Look at what they tell you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.230" offset="6939953">They tell you that we need to have the manufacturers and suppliers, the upstream suppliers, have power to set prices, because interbrand competition, which affects and controls retailers' actions as well, isn't going to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.233" offset="7015917">We have to be afraid of the possibility of retailers having market power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.657" offset="7037651">What happened to the concept of interbrand competition, which they espouse?</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.718" offset="7053847">If interbrand competition exists in a marketplace, why not trust interbrand competition to keep the prices of the retailers at the level the competition would in fact dictate?</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="1738.408" offset="7100658">I guess their answer is that, basically, the only time that a manufacturer would want to do such a thing... not... not 100 percent, but the vast... would be in an instance where interbrand competition was not working perfectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.944" offset="7150813">Otherwise, there wouldn't be power in the dealer to raise price above the competitive level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.187" offset="7171815">That's why he wants to keep it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.411" offset="7180697">There isn't enough interbrand competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.040" offset="7187175">I think that's basically the argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1761.592" offset="7193340">In 30 years, since Albrecht was adopted, what I'm looking for and I don't see in this record or in the literature is any breakdown of interbrand competition controlling retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.240" offset="7244018">As this Court itself pointed out in the... the Sharp case, it is rare, indeed, that you're going to find a retailer that has market power to be able to dictate price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.567" offset="7281321">And, indeed, the concept of GTE/Sylvania was that you don't have to really worry about exclusive territories, because they protect intrabrand competition, because you still have the specter of interbrand competition out there to control these retailers, even though they now have exclusive territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.119" offset="7363450">Under those circumstances, I think the best way to approach the potential problem of a market power in a retailer is under the current jur... jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.376" offset="7408485">And that has two very distinct elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.050" offset="7419247">The first is Albrecht, which is the per se application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.982" offset="7434921">It says that a violation of Section 1 occurs when there is a vertical maximum resale price maintenance agreement... price-fixing at that level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.668" offset="7473687">But there's a second element.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.919" offset="7482673">And that is the Arco case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.651" offset="7489673">And the Arco case says that in order for a private plaintiff to have an antitrust cause of action, that private plaintiff has to establish an antitrust injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.646" offset="7529589">And it is an injury which flows from the core of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.679" offset="7549755">And what is the core of the antitrust laws, as this Court has come to define it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.943" offset="7566787">Interbrand competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.543" offset="7573161">So, thus, you have the per se rule in its maximum, strident position, indeed--</text>
