            <text syncTime="134.116" offset="684711">I mean, that makes some sense, I would think, from the standpoint of the State as well as the defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="150.910" offset="751898">Obviously not Federal courts within California, because in fact only one Federal court has been allowed, has allowed itself, effectively, to consider this question, but I certainly don't dispute that there is some economy in somehow aggregating these issues, and there are procedures for that.</text>

I should say, the issue of Chapter 154 applicability to their Federal habeas proceedings will then turn on what we call the new law.</text>

            <text syncTime="626.729" offset="2655075">I quite agree, although there's another relevant change in the law, a very recent development that speaks to this precise question.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.050" offset="2680361">When this lawsuit was filed, California did not have a certified question procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.454" offset="2698020">Let me make this very concrete.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.004" offset="2708260">One of the questions, one of the subquestions that lurks in a question of compliance, is a State in compliance or not, is whether or not a State has a rule of court governing the appointment of counsel and standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.547" offset="2762386">Now, California clearly has written published standards, and you can find them in your own law library, I'm confident, clearly has had that.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.884" offset="2791747">The claim of the inmates was that that did not have the dignity of a rule of court within the meaning of California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.573" offset="2818497">That's actually not that easy a question, because there are many things that go by that label, rule of court, under California law, and the district court quite clearly did not understand that and applied one very rigid question of California law, one very rigid definition, the most limited definition possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.400" offset="2885788">Now, if California standards for the employment of counsel deserve dignity as a rule of law, that's a State law question.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.839" offset="2915568">The Federal courts we had hoped would understand that and correctly construe it, but in this case that failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.361" offset="2945661">I'm just using this as one example.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.778" offset="2951303">There really would have been... when this lawsuit was filed there was no mechanism for the Federal courts to turn to the State courts in California and effectively ask for guidance on that State procedural question.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.050" offset="2992368">Fortunately, that, too, has changed, and although the district court would not today have any mechanism for asking for guidance on a certified question basis from the district court, the Ninth Circuit surely would have.</text>

            <text syncTime="737.218" offset="3097067">That is to say, I believe that you think the State of California thinks it has complied with the counsel requirements in AEDPA, and a group of prisoners on death row think they have not.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.294" offset="3157357">And so what the group of prisoners says is, if we file our first habeas within 180 days, we can't complain about the statute because we complied with it, and if we wait until after 180 days, and it turns out we're wrong, we are literally without a remedy to complain about being sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.493" offset="3246173">Now, that seems a terrible dilemma to be in, and that's why they filed this lawsuit, and I want to know, in your opinion, are they without any remedy, or if they have a remedy to test out the situation in advance, so they don't get into that dilemma, specifically, what is it?</text>

            <text syncTime="799.893" offset="3347738">It's the earliest opportunity, perhaps, for an inmate to learn whether or not the judge before whom he appears with his habeas proceedings, it's... the earliest opportunity for him to learn whether or not that judge is of the mind that 154 should apply is probably the very first appearance he makes in that court, when he asks for the appointment of Federal counsel and seeks a stay, because if Chapter 154 is applicable in that jurisdiction, the court's authority for entering that stay is 2262(a).</text>

            <text syncTime="1223.498" offset="5042249">The thing that... I think the thing that's bothering me that makes this a serious case is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.986" offset="5064191">Ex parte Young essentially had I think two justifications, and they did not have to be separated in Ex parte Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.342" offset="5105569">In the first place, there was the threat in effect of the imposition or the threat of the... an illegal restriction upon the imposition of a tax, so that if it was an improper restriction, the State officials were acting illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.421" offset="5185922">Secondly, there was what the Court described as rather a fear of draconian consequences if an Ex parte Young proceeding could not be brought because, in fact, if it should turn out that those who wanted to protest the State restriction were wrong, the consequences, the exactions that the State would then be entitled to would virtually, economically would destroy the person who had objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.826" offset="5319564">The stakes, to put it crudely, were too high for normal litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.296" offset="5337432">What we've got here, arguably, is half of Ex parte Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.165" offset="5356867">You're entirely right, we don't have the kind of threatened illegal action that Ex parte Young was talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.621" offset="5386647">But as Justice Breyer's question indicated, there does seem to be an argument that if in fact the prisoner who claims that the State is not in compliance, that that prisoner either has to play it safe and act in accordance with a shorter period, or the prisoner has to take an awful risk, because if the prisoner is wrong, the prisoner, in effect, will be executed without the benefit of Federal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.063" offset="5536485">So it seems to me that arguably half of Ex parte Young is here, and the question is, to me is, is that enough?</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.483" offset="5570131">I will agree with you that the other half seems to be missing, but is the draconian consequence half here, and is that enough for us to say Ex parte Young should apply?</text>
