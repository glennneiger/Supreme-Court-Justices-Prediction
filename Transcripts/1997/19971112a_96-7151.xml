            <label>Mr. Frank Granger</label>
            <text syncTime="56.748" offset="378430">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="59.480" offset="389297">Debra Lewis was charged, tried, and convicted under an assimilated Louisiana murder statute for a crime which was committed on a military reservation in Vernon Parish, Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.708" offset="434227">She was not charged nor tried under the appropriate Federal murder statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.422" offset="457111">On appeal, the Fifth Circuit agreed and reversed the conviction based upon the assimilated Louisiana statute, finding that it did not apply, and that the Assimilative Crimes Act did not allow the prosecutor to assimilate the State statute when, in fact, a Federal murder statute prohibited the conduct for which she was charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.814" offset="534642">However, the Fifth Circuit then affirmed the life imprisonment sentence based upon her conviction of second degree Federal murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.950" offset="563272">We also contend that the affirmance of the sentence is harmful and prejudicial to Debra Lewis because under the sentencing guidelines applicable to Federal second degree murder, such a sentence could not be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.248" offset="620428">For purposes of this argument, the Assimilative Crimes Act is a longstanding Federal statute which merely is a gap filling and a loophole closing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.113" offset="659925">The purpose of the statute was to prevent and allow the Federal Government to prosecute criminal actions on military reservations on territory under exclusive Federal jurisdiction when, by assimilating a State criminal statute if, and only if, there was no Federal statute which made the conduct sort to be prosecuted--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="147.977" offset="743308">Well, I'm not sure that's the backdrop against which that was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.799" offset="758668">I think there was considerable sentiment at the time that basically State law ought to apply to crimes committed in areas that the Federal Government was administering, and what do you think our policy should be in general, to find that State law should apply where possible, because that is the backdrop under which this statute was passed in the first place.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_granger" startTime="177.506" stopTime="318.530">
            <label>Mr. Frank Granger</label>
            <text syncTime="177.506" offset="861486">--Yes, Justice O'Connor, I under... I agree with you, but once the Assimilative Crimes Act was adopted initially in approximately 1825, it was because Congress at that particular point in time had not taken a very proactive role in adopting criminal statutes, so what happened was, you'd have a person commit an act or a criminal... or a crime on a military reservation or in the territories and then be able to flaunt and get away with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.031" offset="955527">So as Justice Story has been noted to say, that necessity... in fact, he was one of the authors of part of the Assimilative Crimes Act, along with Daniel Webster, in saying that we have to allow these crimes to be punished and close... my words, close the loopholes or fill the gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.713" offset="1018325">There is great sentiment to apply State law on these reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.696" offset="1034208">However, Congress has spoken.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.517" offset="1041522">In 18 U.S.C. section 13, which I have at page 5 of my brief, the original brief, it says, whoever is guilty of any act or omission which, although not made punishable by any enactment of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.916" offset="1103067">So in times past, and in this particular case before 1909, when there was no Federal murder statute, clearly the Government would have been faced with a proposition that it couldn't prosecute for murder, so obviously they had to assimilate the State crime and say we can't allow you to get away with this, and so we'll take the State crime, and by section 13, it becomes a Federal crime and we prosecute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.851" offset="1194809">I think in this particular case we get to the point of whether the particular act is made punishable by an enactment of Congress, and I think that the statutes are clear again.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.298" offset="1240575">Congress has adopted the Federal murder statute at 18 U.S.C. section 1111, which you'll find at page 5 and 6 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.014" offset="1275475">This statute clearly sets forth a comprehensive scheme of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.569" offset="1293656">As in most States, there's a difference between first degree and second degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.619" offset="1309852">Congress has done the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.332" offset="1316748">Congress has found that there would be first degree murders, which are generally murders, or killing of human beings with malice aforethought, but also premeditated murders such as poison, lying in wait, or again they have another group of murders that are specifically listed as first degree murders, which is arson, escape, murder, kidnapping, treason, espionage, sabotage, aggravated sexual abuse, or sexual abuse, burglary, or robbery.</text>

            <text syncTime="356.485" offset="1577346">I mean, I think you're analyzing it and very likely quite proper in saying, here's how Congress treated murder, but if you say, how did Congress treat offenses against juveniles, then you would come at it in a somewhat different way.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.477" offset="1657385">I think the way that Congress has specified this statute is merely to set forth the crimes in two broad categories that are fairly com... that are comprehensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.054" offset="1703674">However, Congress also has another way of doing this, because I know the issue here is murder of a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.008" offset="1727498">However, if we looked at the sentencing guidelines... I believe it's section 381.2... which provides for an enhancement under the murder statute for a vulnerable victim, clearly, Congress then decided that when you have younger persons we have to make an allowance and enhance the penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="489.492" offset="2109408">Whereas, when we look at the Louisiana first degree murder statute, it, in much the same way, has broken down murder into first degree and second degree to take into consideration various persons, statuses, or crimes committed within the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate another crime, just like the first degree murder statute in... that Congress adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.044" offset="2191641">However, what Louisiana has done is sought to enforce punishment through the differentiation of the types of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.299" offset="2224660">Whereas in first degree murder you have either a death penalty or life imprisonment without parole, and in second degree murder you have life in prison without parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.564" offset="2257679">However, the conduct, or the act, is the killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.657" offset="2270009">I think it's a fairly specific thing that we can all realize and agree upon that is what murder is, is the killing of a human being.</text>

            <text syncTime="585.103" offset="2491840">What I'm trying to propose is simply a clear reading of the statutes, because it appears to me that it's fairly clear that Congress has taken over the field of murder, especially after 1909, as it applies to any act which has occurred upon a military reservation, or any act under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1481.550" offset="6077617">Is it a purely analytical test, or is it ultimately an intent test?</text>

            <text syncTime="1485.383" offset="6092977">Justice Souter, I believe it's clearly an analytical test because the intent issue clearly is covered within the Federal murder statute if you're thinking of criminal intent, whether it be premeditated or with just malice aforethought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.999" offset="6143445">However, in that respect it's an analytical test because the murders... we're not looking to what State law describes as to what intent should apply, whereas in Louisiana in this particular case you only have the issue of, for first degree murder under Louisiana law, a specific intent to kill, or specific intent to inflict great bodily harm, the death of the person, and the person being under the age of 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.176" offset="6240098">So it's strictly analytical, because we don't look to whether another State or a State statute would describe the intent required to meet the definition of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.142" offset="6276043">We look at whether Federal law covers the act, and then Federal law itself then describes what intents are requisite for what purposes, whether it be first degree murder, second degree murder, or voluntary or involuntary manslaughter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1557.368" offset="6380846">The text of the Assimilative Crimes Act is set forth at page 2 of the Government's brief, and I think the proper disposition of this case hinges on analysis of two phrases within that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.668" offset="6426090">The first is the phrase, act or omission, the second is the phrase, made punishable, and I'd like to address them in that order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1577.013" offset="6459527">I... as to the phrase, act or omission, I think it hinges on interpreting them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.714" offset="6478231">The phrase, act or omission, is often used to refer to a particular incident of primary conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.111" offset="6507906">That is, this Court has frequently stated that a single act may constitute more than one offense, and in that situation it's used in contradistinction to offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.395" offset="6541029">On the other hand, it would not be unnatural to say, for example, that 18 U.S.C. 1111 defines murder as the act of killing a human being with malice aforethought, in which case the word act would be used not to refer to a particular incident at a particular time and place, but to a category of conduct meeting the requisite specifications, and in our view the words act or omission in this statute should be construed to mean, offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.303" offset="6648654">The question is whether the State law offense is made punishable by an enactment of Congress, and I think there are several reasons--</text>

I'll get to made punishable in more detail, but I think the short answer is, one of the features of the Blockburger test is that a greater and a lesser included offense are treated as the same offense for double jeopardy purposes, and that would not be our position with respect to this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.123" offset="6771951">That is, if State law has defined a greater offense, we would not say that that has been made punishable by an act of Congress simply because Congress has defined a lesser included offense, as in this case.</text>

I realize this is a '93 crime, but just for analytical purposes here, what Congress has done is to say, aha, there will be this specific murder category, that specific murder category, that specific category of crimes against children, and that sounds a lot like what was going on in Williams.</text>
