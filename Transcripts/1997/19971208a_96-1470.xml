            <text syncTime="149.512" offset="742555">We believe that, to the extent the Government is relying on copyright law for that position, that it is up to Congress to pass the law and set the policy, and it is up to this Court to interpret that position of Congress and what Congress said and meant.</text>

            <text syncTime="183.067" offset="876824">There is no role for the Copyright Office or any other agency of the executive branch to administer 602(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="190.637" offset="907022">It is solely a private right of action, and under those circumstances we think there is no deference to be accorded.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.948" offset="980269">Let me ask you one more question, since I have you interrupted, and then I'll leave it alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.669" offset="999182">Section 501, dealing with infringement of copyright, says anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner covered by sections 106 through 118, or who imports copies into the United States in violation of section 602, is an infringer.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.832" offset="1079848">Under your theory, that section wouldn't be needed, I suppose, insofar as it refers to section 602.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="allen_r_snyder" startTime="243.788" stopTime="295.990">
            <label>Mr. Allen R. Snyder</label>
            <text syncTime="243.788" offset="1119659">I think it's correct that that particular language could have been omitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.259" offset="1137527">However, it would have raised questions where, in... for courts to interpret the language, since section 106 obviously deals with distribution to the extent we're discussing it here, and we all agree that importation is not literally the same thing as distribution, Congress chose to make importation part of the distribution right.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.006" offset="1224567">Had section 501 not specifically referred to importation, someone could have argued that the reference there to distribution or to section 106 didn't necessarily cover things that were actually dealt with in 602 but not literally in 106.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.634" offset="1294993">I think it was a situation where Congress appropriately tried to be sure that their intention was crystal clear.</text>

          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="295.990" stopTime="316.319">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="295.990" offset="1328429">Mr. Snyder, I--</text>
            <text syncTime="296.990" offset="1332504">--Of course, one of the things they... just on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.875" offset="1340028">One of the things they wanted to make sure of, perhaps, is that 602 was kept intact as an independent provision, because 602 says, under their reading, that it is an independent act of infringement to import without the consent.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="allen_r_snyder" startTime="316.319" stopTime="340.269">
            <label>Mr. Allen R. Snyder</label>
            <text syncTime="316.319" offset="1409827">Well, it is an act of infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.855" offset="1419962">However, I think it's not totally independent in the sense that the language of 602 specifically made importation a violation of the distribution right under 106, so as we interpret the language, Congress was saying that we wish to make importation a separate type of violation of the distribution right.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="340.269" offset="1505540">But Mr. Snyder, if you're right about that, wouldn't it have been more logical to say, in the first part of 501(a), exclusive rights, section 106 through, including the right, the 602 right, instead of making it conjunctive, as... instead of making it separate?</text>
            <text syncTime="361.098" offset="1588922">Your argument would fit very well if Congress had said 602 belongs with 106A, but it makes it separate, and in that light, going back to Justice O'Connor's point about the representations this Nation has made, the Government isn't making them in the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.512" offset="1678575">It does point to this 501(a), and if that's a plausible reading, even if we don't owe Chevron deference, don't we owe some... don't we give some weight to the representations our Government has made to other Governments?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="allen_r_snyder" startTime="401.592" stopTime="681.003">
            <label>Mr. Allen R. Snyder</label>
            <text syncTime="401.592" offset="1750882">Well, first of all, Justice Ginsburg, 501 obviously is not the section that specifically was dealing with either the distribution right or the importation issue, and I think to determine Congress' intent, the first place that I would urge the Court to look would be the statutes directly on point, including 109, but I take your point that it could have been phrased in a different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.006" offset="1836563">However, I would suggest respectfully to the Court that by referring in 602 to the rights under 106, Congress was doing something that really made quite a bit of sense, and that is that all of the panoply of conditions and exceptions to distribution rights that are contained within 106 and its cross-referenced sections thereby were applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.156" offset="1941158">Section 106 begins by saying, subject to sections 107 through 120, quote-unquote, there will be certain exclusive rights, including the distribution right.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.798" offset="1987656">Those exceptions include such things as the fair use doctrine, which is a quite fundamental element of American copyright law.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.570" offset="2022764">By... by making 602 a part of the 106 right and cross-referencing it the way Congress did, it included the fair use doctrine, the first sale doctrine, the other exceptions, into the importation rules just as they're in all the other parts of the copyright law.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.198" offset="2101340">Section 501 simply provides for the enforcement mechanism for all of the rights, and I would respectfully suggest that, because it lists importation as an additional word in 501, it really doesn't negate, I don't believe, the intent of Congress in the operative sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.629" offset="2183051">And obviously one of the key operative sections here is section 109, and 109, which is the current codification of the first sale doctrine, which is a doctrine that goes back well over 100 years in copyright law, section 109 says that if someone is the owner of a particular copy that was lawfully made under this title, that that owner can sell or otherwise dispose of that copy.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.548" offset="2298722">And we believe that that is about as broad language as Congress could use and in fact follows a... quite a lengthy history of broad language in the statutes, the predecessor statutes, and in the legislative history, all of which have made clear that Congress intended to say that once a particular copy that's lawfully made under the U.S. copyright law has been sold, the copyright owner's rights cease, and that's the actual language in the legislative history of the '76 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.685" offset="2431215">The rights cease, of the U.S. copyright owner, as to that particular copy.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.256" offset="2453576">We think that the first sale doctrine, there is nothing in the language of the statute that suggests that the first sale doctrine was being overridden, or that Congress intended to change it, there's nothing in the legislative history where Congress was talking about changing the first sale doctrine, and we think the more natural reading of all of these sections together, including section 501, the more natural reading, to try to follow the congressional intent, not the policy arguments that each side can make, not the positions that the executive branch might wish to take as a matter of policy or as a matter of bilateral negotiations, we think that the fairer way to read the actual language of Congress is the way we've set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.737" offset="2639463">The treaties... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.570" offset="2646777">They're not treaties, actually.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.537" offset="2650643">They're bilateral agreements that the Government has cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.239" offset="2665481">They represent positions that the executive branch has taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.107" offset="2684916">I might add that they've taken that position in multilateral negotiations and the international community has so far rejected them, but Trinidad and Tobago and several other countries, and you have the lodgings in front of you, have agreed to the U.S. position.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.152" offset="2745102">However, there is no liability on the part of the United States if the U.S. position is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.306" offset="2769762">If there's a violation of those agreements, there is an obligation for consultation.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.858" offset="2787943">There is no arbitration, there is no financial liability, and we would respectfully suggest that if the executive branch wishes to curtail parallel imports beyond the language of existing statutes, then if they wish to rely on copyright law or any other congressional enactment, they should go to Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="759.455" offset="3182287">This is a quite common situation, and it was discussed at length in the deliberations leading up to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.341" offset="3205902">If an author gives the British copyright to his or her book to a British company, and the U.S. copyright to his or her book to a U.S. copyright holder, the U.S. copyright holder obviously wishes to avoid having the unrelated British copyright holder ship 1,000 copies of the book here because the U.S. copyright holder has no control over the independent entity, has not been paid anything for those copies, et cetera.</text>

            <text syncTime="1271.397" offset="5230078">Congress obviously is free to address it, and the Government can either submit the bilateral agreements that it's negotiated to Congress for review, or it can go in with a statute on parallel imports.</text>

            <text syncTime="1375.131" offset="5645007">Basically, our position is that 109 applies in the importation situation just as it applies to all other aspects of the distribution right, and 109 limits the distribution right to some extent, and we think the importation rules in 602 have become part of the distribution right, and 109 applies to those as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="1453.148" offset="5957118">I think it's important at the outset to note that we believe that the K Mart v. Cartier case is not apposite to this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.103" offset="5996929">In that case, the Court addressed section 526 of the Tariff Act of 1930, and under section 526, a U.S. entity can record its U.S. trademark with the Customs Service to prevent unauthorized importation of goods, even those with a genuine trademark.</text>

            <text syncTime="3288.565" offset="13298780">We agree with that, and we think that's the key issue before the Court, and in our view the position of the U.S. Government in bilateral negotiations or bilateral agreements doesn't by itself change what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.790" offset="13351652">And I would point out to the Court that in one of the lodgings that the Solicitor General has provided the Court is a 1990 telegram that includes the Government's legal position and argument before most of these bilateral agreements were negotiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.518" offset="13418630">In that memorandum the Government lawyer cites the Sebastian decision from the Third Circuit, which was at the time the only court of appeals decision on this issue anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.726" offset="13459381">The Government was aware that the law, as set forth by the court of appeals, was contrary to their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.796" offset="13483727">We believe they could have come to Congress for a clarifying change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.248" offset="13501491">They still can.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.848" offset="13503894">There is no reason why the Government can't ask Congress to change the law, but we believe there has been nothing cited today or otherwise that suggests that Congress in the copyright statute was making the kind of broad, antiparallel imports rule that the Congress... that the respondents and their amici are now suggesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.411" offset="13582157">All of the amici for respondents, including the Solicitor General, have been really quite candid in saying that a big part of what's at issue here is that many manufacturers do charge more for U.S. made goods in the United States than those U.S. manufacturers charge for the same U.S. made goods in foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.009" offset="13664495">The Solicitor General has argued that somehow that's good for our economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.527" offset="13678601">That's a policy argument we don't agree with, but we do not think that that is an issue for this Court to decide or for us to opine on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.716" offset="13707336">If the Congress wishes for U.S. consumers to pay more for U.S. goods than foreign consumers, that is a legitimate issue for Congress to deal with as a matter of policy, parallel import--</text>
