            <text syncTime="42.514" offset="314769">In holding that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, was a political committee within the meaning of the Federal Election Campaign Act, the court of appeals misinterpreted this Court's decisions, and it did so in a case it should not have reviewed on the merits, for the respondents do not have standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.694" offset="399510">AIPAC is an association engaged in issue advocacy and lobbying.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.472" offset="418632">The FEC investigated a complaint filed by individuals who disagree with AIPAC's policies, and the FEC concluded that AIPAC had, quote, likely made inkind contributions aggregating over 1,000 in a calendar year.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.498" offset="482684">The commission then considered whether AIPAC was thereby a political committee under the act, in which case it would be required to disclose all receipts and disbursements over 200 dollars, whether or not they were related in any way to a campaign, and it would be limited in how much money it could receive, and from whom.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.363" offset="562201">The commission, interpreting the statute in light of this Court's decisions in Buckley and Massachusetts Citizens for Life, concluded that, because campaignrelated activity was not a major purpose of AIPAC, its incidental campaign spending did not require it to comply with the act's restrictions on political committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.622" offset="651226">In concluding that the FEC acted, quote, contrary to law, the court of appeals erred in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.759" offset="679752">Let me just say a few words about the merits and then address the standing issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.398" offset="694276">In Massachusetts Citizens for Life, this Court deemed it, quote, undisputed that an organization making nearly 10,000 in campaignrelated spending was not a political committee because its major purpose was issue advocacy, not election activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.422" offset="762403">In so holding, this Court relied on its earlier conclusion in Buckley that, quote, to fulfill the purposes of the FECA, the term political committee need only encompass organizations that under... that are under the control of a candidate, or the major purpose of which is the nomination or election of a candidate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2894.398" offset="11722338">--So you're saying it's a contribution, and... well, I think I have to say two things about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.552" offset="11746893">Number 1, you know, every person is presumed to know the law, and if you run afoul of the law inadvertently, but in the manner that you've described, certainly there is enforcement discretion that the FEC has, can exercise and say, now, this one time thing you did, you made a mistake, it wasn't a wilful violation, you didn't know what you were doing, you can't do that kind of thing, don't do it again, and that would be an appropriate disposition of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.572" offset="11846994">What we have here with respect to AIPAC is years and years and campaign after campaign of extensive contributions to candidates, and the public needs to know which current officeholders were the recipients of AIPAC campaign contributions so they can know in the next election cycle who they should vote for, considering that factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.345" offset="11934139">But your hypothetical might be one that could both... that might fall either within the constitutional exemption, or that might be appropriately subject to disposition by the FEC's enforcement discretion, in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.403" offset="11974367">But on the facts of this case, based upon the voluminous investigation that we have here, there are very substantial campaign contributions over an extended period of time here, and I think that distinguishes this case from that hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.850" offset="12028075">All we need show to establish redressability is a likelihood that a ruling on the merits will result in disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.612" offset="12067154">We've shown the likelihood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.362" offset="12074155">The Court... not only is the major purpose test not necessary to protect against what... the danger that the FEC hypothesizes, it's not sufficient to do so, either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.718" offset="12119608">Under the test that the FEC has clarified it to be, a dual purpose organization that has as a major purpose campaign contributions will be a political committee even if another major purpose of the organization is pure issue advocacy, yet under their own test, as they apply it, that organization as a whole would be a political committee and be subject to all... full disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.878" offset="12224202">For this reason, of all its activities, including the noncampaign activity, the test is neither necessary nor sufficient to accomplish the goal that's put forward for it, and it eviscerates the statute, because the problem is, it exempts from disclosure campaign contributions, not just noncampaign activities.</text>
