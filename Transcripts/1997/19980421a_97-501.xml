Florida, that a full custodial arrest is when you're taken into custody, when you can be subjected to an inventory search, when the area around you can be searched, when you're subject to up to 48 hours of post-arrest processing.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.364" offset="467663">In this case the arrest was not as severe as it could have been, but I don't think the Court has ever engaged in balancing the severity of an arrest.</text>
