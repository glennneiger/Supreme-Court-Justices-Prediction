            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="152068">We'll hear argument now in Number 97-679, American Telephone and Telegraph Company v. Central Office Telephone, Incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.627" offset="190520">Mr. Carpenter.</text>

            <label>Mr. David W. Carpenter</label>
            <text syncTime="11.029" offset="196163">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.941" offset="207761">The question in this case is whether the Ninth Circuit correctly held that the statutory filed tariff requirements, here codified in section 203 of the Communications Act, apply only to rates and not to the services provided in exchange for those rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.271" offset="277142">The answer to this question is that the holding is simply wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.444" offset="289786">The statutory terms are not limited to rates, but they also prohibit, among other things, any untariffed privilege or facility in communication and any form of rebate, and this Court has held many times that it's an unlawful rebate and preference in violation of these prohibitions for a carrier to provide a service or to enforce a service guarantee that is not covered by the carrier's tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.181" offset="392708">And this case also lacks the element that made the recent Maislin and MCI v. ATT cases close questions in this Court, for no Federal agency responsible for the administration of these requirements has ever suggested the Ninth Circuit's interpretation, much less endorsed it as advancing some other legitimate statutory goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.904" offset="475673">The reality is, is that in situations where tariffing requirements have applied and should continue to apply, and the Federal agencies have found that there are many, the Ninth Circuit's holding would create the very discrimination in rates that everyone, even our opponent, concedes to be the purpose of this requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.307" offset="549234">Under the holding, carriers could evade the prohibitions not by misquoting the rates, but by misquoting the service, making service guarantees that aren't in the tariff, and when they're breached excusing the carrier from paying tariff charges and paying an amount of money that would represent the damages for the breach.</text>

            <text syncTime="129.657" offset="670651">The only claims that were litigated is that it was a State law breach of contract, an intentional interference with tortious relationships, with business relationships for ATT to fail to provide COT with the quality of regulated long distance service that COT claimed it had been promised.</text>

            <text syncTime="209.029" offset="988091">First, there are a whole range of intentional and nonintentional torts that don't arise out of the carrier-customer relationship and the fortuity that someone happens to be our customer wouldn't immunize us from a tort action if that... if a customer were a victim of such a tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.077" offset="1052352">Second, with respect to things that arise out of the customer-carrier relationship, we are under a series of duties under the Communications Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.126" offset="1272512">Let me maybe put some of these questions to rest right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.238" offset="1284946">If AT&amp;T had deliberately provided COT, other resellers with service that was inferior in quality to that that the commercial customers had received, we would have violated 202 of the Communications Act and we would have been liable to it for the damages we caused.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.480" offset="1349939">Now, those damages would have been determined under the Federal standards of the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="909.726" offset="3790925">Well, let me respond to both.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.168" offset="3796672">When slamming occurs, generally the carrier that's the victim isn't your customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.362" offset="3821436">MCI occasionally changes our customers to it when they're not authorized, so that's something that has nothing to do with the fact, whether two carriers happen to be customers of one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.539" offset="3874204">It's entirely independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.781" offset="3879115">It's just fortuitous in this situation that in the two incidents of slamming that occurred, but they weren't the basis for this judgment, that COT happened to also be our customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.138" offset="3916522">Now, with respect to Nader, that was a case, there was no filed tariff claim, and that was a case where the practice of disclosing overbooking or not... overbooking or not was outside the CAB's definition of the tariff transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.037" offset="3980156">They had a regulation that specifically authorized common law actions in the event that there was nondisclosure of overbooking.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.813" offset="4011294">So the key thing is what's within the scope of the agency's definition and the statute's definition of the regulated service, and if a claim involves the rates or the services to be provided in exchange for the rates, then it's going to be governed exclusively by Federal law and Federal standards, and State law can't be applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1012.765" offset="4203033">Posner suggested he'd have to prove that the ugli fruit was provided at a market rate.</text>
