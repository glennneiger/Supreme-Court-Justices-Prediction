            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="143927">We'll hear argument next in Number 97-689, Bonnie Geissal v. the Moore Medical Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.519" offset="193978">Very well, Mr. Weinhaus.</text>

            <text syncTime="20.136" offset="224384">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="22.756" offset="234938">In this case, Mr. Geissal, who is now dead, was terminated from his employment by Moore Medical Corporation at a time when he had cancer and was dying of cancer.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.683" offset="274644">He was offered immediately COBRA continuation and at the same time his wife had always carried health insurance coverage with her own employer which covered dependents, including Mr. Geissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.751" offset="322918">He was allowed to continue to make COBRA payments for 6 months, when all of a sudden Moore Medical announced that it was not responsible for his health insurance coverage, they wrongly accepted COBRA payments, they would pay him back, and they would not pay any of his bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.003" offset="387911">This case was brought, using the wording of the statute, and the wording is simple, and that's where we start with, that coverage must be offered to the individual of the same quality as given to employees, and that would be true... if employees got dual coverage, he would be entitled to dual coverage, required to offer the same policy, and it must extend for at least the period beginning on the date of the qualifying event and ending not earlier than the earliest of the following, and one of them is, when... the date on which he becomes... first becomes qualified after the date of election for further insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.047" offset="544018">Now, in this instance, Moore Medical Corporation took the position that he first became, after the date of election, covered by the wife's policy and therefore was not entitled to the coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.929" offset="615594">At that point, litigation ensued.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.608" offset="710262">My understanding, some were not paid, but unfortunately in this case what the magistrate judge did is, after denying our motion for summary judgment, turned around and, sua sponte, without development of anything in the record, declared summary judgment for Moore Medical Corporation, so there is no record and, while Moore Medical does continuously argue, in the absence of a record, that we lost nothing, we don't think that's true.</text>

            <text syncTime="1216.599" offset="5010226">It's the becomes is... carries the major part of the weight, and I do think first adds to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.901" offset="5023496">But in any event, because on the date after the date of election it cannot be said that the employee has first become covered under the other plan, and that won't be true at any other future date if there's continuous coverage, the employer cannot terminate COBRA coverage on... just right after the date of election on the basis that the employee has first become covered by a plan that he had, in fact, all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.167" offset="5104580">In our view, that fits well within the purposes of the statute because, as I said, it provides... it enables employees who are relying on that coverage and who may have had wholly inadequate second coverage to make the decision of what kind of coverage is adequate for them, and to have that for this temporary period of time for up to 18 months in a case like this, while they make whatever other plans they wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.140" offset="5192456">In response... I just want to add, because I do think that the hardest case for us is the case where the employee... the case that Justice Scalia raised, which is where the employee gets the coverage during the election period, that really it's necessary to allow that to happen, because that is the only... the only way that Congress could ensure itself that an employee, when it made an election with respect to the new policy, when it decided it wanted the coverage... when he decided he wanted coverage under the new policy, it was the only way that Congress could be sure that that was an informed choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.622" offset="5318366">And it's also clear from the general structure of the statute that Congress wanted those... the employee to have that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.505" offset="5341876">For example, when a... let's take on the 65th day, or the 70th day, long after the date of election, and an employee who is covered under COBRA gets a new job, well, at that point, when the new employer says, do you want health insurance under this job, or health coverage, the employee is not... just because he's offered the health insurance, COBRA coverage doesn't terminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.018" offset="5423901">The statute says it's when he becomes covered under the new plan, not when he becomes eligible under the new plan, and that shows that Congress wanted people to have the opportunity to make the choice as to whether they wanted the COBRA coverage or whether they wanted the new coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.896" offset="5471444">If you adopt the view of respondent and the court of appeals, the employees wouldn't have that choice very frequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.419" offset="5493596">I think our view is also supported by related provisions of COBRA which provide, for example, that the coverage that's provided under COBRA has to be identical to the coverage that the employee had while working for the former employer, and it's consistent with that purpose to permit employees who had dual coverage, who felt it was necessary because of extraordinary medical needs, because of the inadequacy of a spouse's plan, or perhaps just because of their own very strong desire to have security with respect to their medical costs, to permit employees who are in that situation who had dual coverage before for sometime, to be able to also continue the dual coverage during the temporary COBRA period so long as they're willing to pay for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2102.404" offset="8553475">If I understand that, then, let's go to the question of why Congress might have wanted it, and I take it that the reason they might have wanted this interpretation that the petitioners have is because they figure all of us... you know, many people in this room, hundreds of people have coverage through their employer, their spouse works, he or she has coverage as well, so everybody has two policies, basically, the potential for two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.591" offset="8646262">Not everybody in the world, but huge numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.734" offset="8654830">And what Congress is interested in, after all, is that when you lose... when one spouse loses one job, they want a conscious choice, or otherwise you're covered for 18 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.120" offset="8696312">So during the 18 months period, if you don't make a conscious choice to go choose something else, you're still covered by your employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.386" offset="8725465">If you make a conscious choice, the employer should be off the hook.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.778" offset="8738944">Now, I mean, that's an obvious reading, I guess, of the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.412" offset="8749498">That seems to be what I got out of the other side's briefs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2155.644" offset="8766425">That basically gets back to the preservation of the status quo argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.918" offset="8783561">First of all, if Congress were so concerned about the preservation of the status quo, their... the provisions also in the same sub-sub-subsection of this act, also (ii), deals with medicare, and medicare is a mandatory event that causes termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.275" offset="8876975">It talks about eligibility for medicare being a terminating event, and medicare has... is substantially different in the character of the policies between the normal group health plan and this group health plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.984" offset="8939774">For one thing is, is almost all group health plans have prescription medication health.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.268" offset="8964956">Whether it's... there's a co-pay, or whether they pay all of it, or whatever, there's something in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.492" offset="8981883">Medicare certainly doesn't have that type of provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.234" offset="8992854">So there's two points is, is one is there's no issue here, and there's nothing that can be gleaned from the face of the act that shows that Congress was concerned about the preservation of... an identical preservation of the status quo, and there's--</text>
