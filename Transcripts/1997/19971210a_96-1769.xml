            <text syncTime="249.992" offset="1146016">It's almost inherent in the concept of unfettered discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="257.051" offset="1174229">There's no reason to believe that a Governor would act any less responsibly than a court would in exercising power, and in fact clemency by constitutional design was meant to be an unfettered power of the executive branch as a check on the judicial branch, so fundamentally our position--</text>
