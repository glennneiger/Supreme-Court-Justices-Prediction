            <text syncTime="48.893" offset="345210">That determination is constitutionally valid for three main reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="59.519" offset="387738">Second, polygraph evidence is not necessary to help the trier of fact perform its core function of determining credibility of witnesses, and third, the costs of litigating about the reliability of polygraph evidence on a case-by-case basis outweigh any limited probative value that the polygraph may have.</text>

            <text syncTime="98.876" offset="545204">In 1987, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, then the Court of Appeal... Military Appeals, determined that the per se rule against polygraph evidence which had prevailed in the military should be dropped, and that individual defendants should have the opportunity to litigate about it in each case, and in 1991 the evident response to that was to reinstate the per se rule that had been prevalent in courts across the country as well as the military courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1189.919" offset="4909325">And even after Daubert has been decided, and several Federal courts have reconsidered whether it is appropriate to have a per se rule and have opted some case-by-case litigation, polygraph evidence is rarely being admitted in criminal trials in the civilian courts, by and large because the judges are concluding that either it will not assist the trier of fact, or it is unreliable either in a particular instance or across the board, or because traditional Rule 403 balancing considerations justify the exclusion of the evidence because it's not really needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.541" offset="5039832">I think that the President is certainly in a position to take all of that into account and to conclude that the military courts, of all places, should not be a place where experimentation with new evidence is to be carried out.</text>

            <text syncTime="2797.674" offset="11340358">Well, Your Honor, that came from a study... a survey that was conducted by Dr. Licken... Dr. Lykken... I'm not sure which the correct way was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.727" offset="11364600">The study has been called into question by the amicus brief that we have done by the Committee for Concerned Social Scientists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.594" offset="11392081">Basically, they... they... obviously, it is polarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.283" offset="11394797">There's no doubt about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.974" offset="11409530">Dr. Raskin and Dr. Honts and some other scientists talk about this study that the government relies on, and says less than one-third said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.250" offset="11446624">But there were some problems with the survey that they point out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.304" offset="11462925">They... they... to question whether it was a random sampling, the context that the survey was sent out under.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.487" offset="11487584">Apparently, it had a cover letter that dealt with the O.J. Simpson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.761" offset="11500750">It asked them about legal implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.801" offset="11508900">And we would submit that there are two other surveys that are out there that show very different results from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.747" offset="11536694">In fact, two other surveys... one done by Gallup in 1982, I believe, and... and another survey done by a Dr. Amato, both show that about two-thirds of that same group would support the polygraph being used, at least in conjunction with... as one piece, with other evidence, in... in making this type of determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.279" offset="11614748">And the last survey that they reference in their brief was conducted by someone who is noted for being almost a vitriolic critic of polygraph evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3173.468" offset="12843548">The fundamental unreliability of polygraph evidence is underscored not only for the reasons that Justice Breyer adverted to, but also because of the possibility that countermeasures can defeat any test.</text>
