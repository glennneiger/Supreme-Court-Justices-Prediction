            <text syncTime="13.219" offset="199970">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.123" offset="211568">The issue presented here today is whether there is a general maritime law survival cause of action for the pre-death injuries to a nonseafarer when the conduct that causes the injuries occurs on the high seas and whether, if there is such a survival cause of action under general maritime law, it may be brought independent of but coexisting alongside the death action under the Death on the High Seas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.251" offset="312087">In order to understand the argument, it is important to point out the distinctions between the survival cause of action and the wrongful death cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.328" offset="348345">As this Court has stated several times, the survival cause of action traditionally encompassed... encompasses the injuries that the individual he or herself sustained prior to death from the time of the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.016" offset="399127">Those traditionally encompassed pre-death pain and suffering, loss of earnings from the time of injury to the time of death, and any medical or associated expenses relating to the injuries until the time of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.254" offset="444058">In the case that is before the Court today, the petitioners only have a right to claim for pre-death injuries, for pre-death pain and suffering, for the 12 minutes that their decedent suffered from the time the aircraft upon which they were passengers were fired upon until a 12-minute controlled descent into the Sea of Japan and their ultimate deaths.</text>

            <text syncTime="98.761" offset="542069">The case, of course, since it does survive... involve the survivor's action, could mean much more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.327" offset="572371">There would be other cases in which people would linger for years with substantial injuries, et cetera.</text>

            <label>Ms. Juanita Madole</label>
            <text syncTime="111.650" offset="593687">--That's correct, and respondent in their response to the petition for certiorari also agreed that the rule of the Court... that this Court will lay down will be applied whenever the conduct causes the injuries and ultimately causes the death occurring on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.759" offset="654082">In a more typical accident, they probably will be more boat-based fact patterns, but the context in which the case is before the Court is... does arise out of an airplane accident and does address only pre-death pain and suffering and injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.721" offset="717926">By comparison with survival action injuries, wrongful death remedies... excuse me, survival action remedies, by contrast wrongful death remedies, are losses that the family members of the decedent themselves have sustained, those losses that are individual to the family members, are as a result of the death of the decedent and are normally economically based.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.065" offset="811340">Normally they are for loss of support, for loss of economic support that the decedent would have provided had the decedent continued to live, loss of services, household services and, in the case of a parent leaving small children, loss of parental services to the small children.</text>

            <text syncTime="183.698" offset="881870">In a survival cause of action the estate is the beneficiary, as the holder of the individual injured person's claim after his death.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="194.667" offset="925756">Ms. Madole, I think that the Court is generally familiar with the difference between a wrongful death act and a survival act, and getting down to the nub of your problem, as I understand it the FELA originally did not have any survival aspect to it, and this Court declined to create such a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.275" offset="1036097">It left it to Congress and Congress took care of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.416" offset="1048740">Why shouldn't we follow the same pattern here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="juanita_madole" startTime="229.389" stopTime="253.816">
            <label>Ms. Juanita Madole</label>
            <text syncTime="229.389" offset="1064623">--What occurred is, I believe, Justice Ginsburg, is that the original FELA was patterned after Lord Campbell's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.833" offset="1094402">Lord Campbell's Act required that the cause of action exist in the person at the time of the death for there to be a right to recover for survival and for death.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.888" offset="1130556">The FELA was amended in 1910 to provide for both causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.713" offset="1153857">The Death on the High Seas Act, which is the--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="253.816" offset="1162321">But am I wrong in thinking that there was an attempt, before that amendment, to get the courts to recognize a survival claim for railroad workers?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="juanita_madole" startTime="263.803" stopTime="307.353">
            <label>Ms. Juanita Madole</label>
            <text syncTime="263.803" offset="1202236">--Yes, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.666" offset="1209759">In Michigan Central Railway v. Vreeland the Court said you could not have both a survival action and a wrongful death action under the FELA, and that was then amended by Congress in 1910.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.832" offset="1254376">But the basis for that was because the wrongful death action under FELA was based upon a Lord Campbell's Act type of statute which required the existence of a cause of action in the decedent at the time of the death, and if there had been recovery for survival there could not also be a death recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.723" offset="1321981">In this circumstance, the statute that we are dealing with is the Death on the High Seas Act, and the argument by respondent and the amicus is that the Death on the High Seas Act precludes the court's traditional development of a survival cause of action.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="307.353" offset="1376420">And wasn't the Death on the High Seas Act... that wasn't modeled on Lord Campbell's Act?</text>

            <label>Ms. Juanita Madole</label>
            <text syncTime="310.756" offset="1390109">It does not in that it did not require the existence of the cause of action in the decedent prior to death, so that there is no foreclosure of a survival cause of action alongside a wrongful death cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.566" offset="1441309">The only issue that the respondent and the Government bring up with regard to the Death on the High Seas Act is whether, by enacting the wrongful death remedy, that the Congress intended to foreclose this Court's traditional role in maritime actions to develop law as policies change, so there's nothing in the Wrongful Death Act under the Death on the High Seas Act itself that would foreclose--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="344.609" offset="1525527">Well, do you consider it significant that Congress was aware of survival provisions under the Federal Employers Liability Act and it did not incorporate them here?</text>
            <text syncTime="353.695" offset="1561785">I mean, that's a significant fact in the case, is it not?</text>

            <label>Ms. Juanita Madole</label>
            <text syncTime="356.717" offset="1573906">--Well, it is to a limited degree, Justice Kennedy, and that is that Congress decided it wanted to provide a remedy from what it felt was the harsh rule of The Harrisburg, that there was no common law right to recover for wrongful death.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.378" offset="1628554">They wanted to provide the remedy in a limited area.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.260" offset="1652065">The debates in the Congressional Record are a) that the Congress wanted to have a remedy and b) how far should that remedy go?</text>
            <text syncTime="386.258" offset="1692084">Should the remedy go only from the 3-miles limit from the shores of the United States, or should Congress legislate into the territorial waters?</text>
            <text syncTime="396.835" offset="1734402">Congress decided just to legislate for death action and just to legislate from the 3-mile limit outwards, and just as this Court in Moragne said as long as Congress did not speak to an area that was not within its ambit, the Admiralty Court is free to develop in accordance with its traditional capacity to effectuate the policies of the common law as circumscribed for the circumstances on the sea.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="420.961" offset="1830847">Well, of course, Congress did, in 42 U.S. Code section 765, deal with death of a plaintiff and what's recoverable, so to that extent Congress certainly addressed the subject.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="juanita_madole" startTime="439.484" stopTime="530.348">
            <label>Ms. Juanita Madole</label>
            <text syncTime="439.484" offset="1905034">To that extent, but that... thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.436" offset="1916842">765 should be put in the context of the statute as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.310" offset="1932306">The Death on the High Seas Act was enacted so that the statute of limitations began to run from the date of the wrongful conduct, other than most typical wrongful death statutes, where the statute of limitations begin... begins to run from the date of the death.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.500" offset="1985074">What Congress was attempting to do in section 765 was to say that if an injured person lived past the 2-year statute, then the wrongful death right would be abated to his or her beneficiaries because the 2 years had run, because of the peculiarity of it beginning from the date of the wrongful conduct instead of the wrongful death.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.613" offset="2069501">The courts below in... not in the case directly in the court below, but other courts below that have addressed these issues, and the commentators both at the time and subsequently, have said that section 765 should best be deemed a non-abatement section and not a survival section, because what happened under section 9... or 765 was, the remedy was then turned into a wrongful death remedy so that the heirs and the beneficiaries of the decedent could recover wrongful death damages but nothing was said in the statute about what happened to the injured person's pre-death injuries, and that was not addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.708" offset="2217877">And again Congress was silent as to the pre-death injuries which is why, if the Court elects to, it has the capacity to develop general maritime law to address pre-death injuries and the survival cause of action.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="530.348" stopTime="558.886">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="530.348" offset="2268450">I guess it's hard for me to see that Congress was entirely silent on what would happen to the claims of pre-death injuries because in 765, if I'm reading it rightly, it converts the pre-existing action for pre-death injuries solely into the kind of death claim that is allowed under the statute, and that sounds to me as though it's saying, everything except the claim allowed under this statute goes away.</text>

            <label>Ms. Juanita Madole</label>
            <text syncTime="558.886" offset="2382553">And again, it has to be read in the context of what it was attempting to achieve, and what Congress was attempting to achieve was a rights-granting statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.982" offset="2422990">It wanted to ensure that wrongful conduct that occurred on the high seas would not be such that the conduct... there would be no compensation for the wrongfulness of the conduct to the one that was injured.</text>

            <text syncTime="583.303" offset="2480251">But if that's all it wanted to do, I would have thought that in 765 it would have said a wrongful death action may be added to the pre-existing personal injury action of... that the decedent had begun, and it didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.872" offset="2538556">It in effect said, it gets metamorphosed into a wrongful death case, period.</text>

            <text syncTime="604.245" offset="2564051">Well, it could be read that way, Justice Souter, but I do not believe that if you look into the historical background of what Congress is trying to achieve, that that effectuates the remedial effects--</text>

            <text syncTime="639.927" offset="2706785">Then I suggest that we look to the language that is at Section 763a, which is the new statute of limitations that was enacted in 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.215" offset="2747954">As I mentioned earlier, the original section 763 provided for a 2-year statute of limitations to begin as of the date of the wrongful conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.661" offset="2789645">In 1980, Congress repealed section 763 and inserted section... excuse me, and enacted section 763a, which is--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="671.089" offset="2831441">--Does that apply to causes of action under than those... other than those under the Death on the High Seas Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="677.203" offset="2855891">Doesn't it cover Jones Act or other causes of action, which might well explain that language?</text>

            <label>Ms. Juanita Madole</label>
            <text syncTime="682.728" offset="2877939">--It does cover causes of action under general maritime law, under the Death on the High Seas Act, and under the Jones Act, and it changed the statute from one in which the statute began to, begin to run from the date of the wrongful conduct until it begins to run from the cause... the date the cause of action accrues, and it extended the statute to 3 years for all three of those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.752" offset="2974069">But if anything can be said from the language in that, is that if Congress ever may have indicated in 1920 that it didn't recognize that both survival actions and death actions or both can be brought together, at least by 1980 they were saying that they knew that there were two kinds of actions and that one and the other could both be brought concurrently with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.280" offset="3072185">And it is not clear from the legislative history of 7... section 763a the prompting mechanism for that, but it's certainly clear that by that time the courts had begun to develop along the lines of... along the ken of... the rationale of this Court in Moragne that there were general maritime law of survival causes of action, based upon the same rationale that The Harrisburg, whether or not it was rightly decided when it had been decided originally, the underpinnings of it had changed because the policy had changed and the jurisprudence had changed, and that there was a wholesale acceptance of wrongful death causes of action in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2183.763" offset="8882131">And to take the argument here that because Congress then specifically say we're not going to allow loss of survival damages, then any time Congress enacts, they don't enact... they don't legislate for the entire scheme, so there's always some type of a hole, but at that point then any court can come in and create any remedy they want.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear</label>
            <text syncTime="2771.630" offset="11233570">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.379" offset="11272545">The United States submits that the Death on the High Seas Act provides the exclusive remedy in this case, and I'd like to explain why.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.571" offset="11297309">Congress enacted the statute in response to this Court's decision in The Harrisburg, which held that general maritime law does not provide a remedy for persons who die from injuries at sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.548" offset="11333253">Congress legislated with the understanding, in the wake of The Harrisburg, that the Federal statutory regime that was created would be the only remedies that would be available for death on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.222" offset="11371914">Congress considered the policy question of appropriate remedies in that light, and it struck what it felt was the proper balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.879" offset="11402530">Here, as in Mobil Oil v. Higginbotham, and as in Offshore Logistics v. Tallentire, this Court should not supplement the statutory wrongful death remedy with other remedies that Congress did not provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.504" offset="11445057">We think that course would be inappropriate here, because it is clear from the text and the legislative history that Congress considered the possibility of a survival action and decided not to provide one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.121" offset="11483509">The most instructive provision of the act for the purposes here is section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.285" offset="11504198">That section recognizes that the plaintiff might die after commencing a personal injury suit for activities on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.710" offset="11533874">The plight of an injured person who begins a suit, but dies before a final judgment is reached, provides an especially sympathetic case for allowing a survival remedy, but even in that case, Congress decided that only a wrongful death remedy would be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.319" offset="11596358">Congress could easily have--</text>
