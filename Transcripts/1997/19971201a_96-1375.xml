            <text syncTime="9.026" offset="174277">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.612" offset="196638">This case presents a straightforward question of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.545" offset="216386">At issue is the meaning of 42 U.S.C. 1395ww(h)(2)(A), which is quoted on page 19 of petitioner's opening brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.670" offset="252853">As the Sixth Circuit correctly concluded in the Toledo case, this is a simple statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.584" offset="280543">It directs the Secretary to do one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.986" offset="294127">It directs the Secretary to determine an average, nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.231" offset="315129">The numerator in this case is the amount recognized as reasonable under this subchapter for GME costs for 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.946" offset="353999">The statute itself does not direct the Secretary to determine the numerator, and the reason why is clear from the words, under this subchapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.113" offset="394646">The statute does not say, under this section, or under this paragraph, but it says, under this subchapter, and there was already a longstanding process in place for determining the amount recognized as reasonable for each year, including 1984.</text>

            <text syncTime="93.293" offset="511361">I mean, it seems to me if they just meant calculate they would have said calculate.</text>

            <text syncTime="96.895" offset="525781">Well, I think when you're referring to an average, determine and calculate are essentially equivalent, and there are, Mr. Chief Justice, within 1395ww(h) other provisions where it's clear that Congress did intend to confer significant authority on the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.249" offset="615224">One such provision is 1395ww(h)(2)(E), which is on page 3 of petitioner's appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.487" offset="664125">I will use ellipses here, but there it says, in the case of a hospital that did not have an approved medical residency training program, ellipses, during fiscal year 1984, the Secretary shall, ellipses, provide for such approved FTE resident amount as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.462" offset="752001">Now, this is language that does clearly grant the secretary discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.336" offset="775511">Here we have activist language.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.647" offset="784811">In (a), the provision we're dealing at... with, the Congress was telling the Secretary, divide A by B, divide one number by another.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.476" offset="836115">--The problem I have with this provision is what it is that the word recognized modifies.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.291" offset="875299">You win, it seems to me, if it is to be read, that the average amount recognized as... recognized as reasonable under this subchapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.579" offset="924514">Does under this subchapter go with recognized?</text>
            <text syncTime="198.582" offset="932455">If it does, I think your case is strengthened.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.424" offset="943844">But it could also be read, the average amount recognized as reasonable under this subchapter.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.449" offset="1036004">But it could also be read as recognized as reasonable under this subchapter, so that the prepositional phrase, under this subchapter, goes with reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.315" offset="1079472">Now, why is it that I should read it the first way rather than the second?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ronald_n_sutter" startTime="238.618" stopTime="322.992">
            <label>Mr. Ronald N. Sutter</label>
            <text syncTime="238.618" offset="1092638">Well, there are a number of reasons, but one is that there is one, and only one statutory provision in the medicare subchapter that does provide for recognizing an amount as reasonable, and that is 42 U.S.C. 1395oo (a), which we have quoted at pages 11 and 12 of petitioner's appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.641" offset="1172781">The relevant language is at the top of page 12, which refers to a final determination, which we know as the notice of program reimbursement for the NPR, as to the amount of total program reimbursement due the provider for the items and services for which payment may be made under this subchapter for the period covered by such report.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.228" offset="1287093">The words that are used in the GME statute is, amount recognized as reasonable under this subchapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.785" offset="1317291">Here in 1395oo(a) we have a specific amount, it is recognized as reasonable... that is, there's a final determination of program reimbursement... it is specifically under this subchapter, and it's specifically for a period.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.245" offset="1387195">This is a very important provision in the medicare subchapter, and in fact is one that this Court has seen before in the Bethesda Hospital Association case decided in 1988.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="322.992" offset="1430140">Well, that... I mean, that's all very persuasive if you read the phrase as recognized under this subchapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.659" offset="1468801">I think you point out quite correctly to that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.682" offset="1484892">That's the only provision it could refer to if it's talking about something that has been recognized under this subchapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.376" offset="1507671">But if it's just talking about something that has been recognized as reasonable, or that will in the future be recognized as reasonable, then it could refer to a new determination and not one that has already been made.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald N. Sutter</label>
            <text syncTime="357.766" offset="1569216">Well, I do... I think the timing here would preclude that, because COBRA 9202(e), which we have cited at page 6 of our reply brief, clearly reflects that Congress intended these amounts to be established by 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.924" offset="1629924">That was well within the reopening period for 1984 in all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.390" offset="1651763">There's no reason why Congress would have wanted to have two amounts.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="382.582" offset="1668481">Well, there's no reason it would want two amounts, but there is a reason that it might want a corrected amount, and suddenly a figure which in the past has been used solely to calculate a reimbursement for 1 year is going to be the basis for reimbursement in effect in perpetuity until the law gets changed, so I mean, there's a... there would be a good reason on Congress' part to want to make sure that the ultimate figure was the right one.</text>

            <text syncTime="414.281" offset="1795332">So we're not talking... I mean, it's not as though... but I guess my only point is, I don't see that you get anywhere by saying Congress wouldn't have wanted two figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.936" offset="1821872">Congress wants one figure and it wants the right figure.</text>

            <text syncTime="508.134" offset="2170764">Now, in almost all cases the reasonable costs would be lower, but there could be cases where the customary charges were lower, and to avoid any ambiguity the words, as reasonable make clear that you're looking at the amount that was recognized as reasonable--</text>

            <text syncTime="2760.504" offset="11180187">This petitioner had time records in 1984 which are very detailed documents, but because the petitioner on the face of the time records did not break down the costs between teaching medical students versus teaching residents, they were allowed to use a new time study, and that's why there was a settlement in this case and the petitioner actually got an increase in the per-resident average.</text>

            <text syncTime="2863.090" offset="11590519">But this statute is a reporting requirement, and there were several reporting requirements imposed on the Secretary in this very bill, but even if you read this reporting requirement as a mandate for the Secretary to do something by a date certain, I don't think you should read in a congressional intent that the Secretary lacks the power to act beyond that statutory deadline.</text>
