            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="149350">We'll hear argument now in Number 96-370, the Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar Corporation of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.136" offset="177876">Ms. Berzon.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="marsha_s_berzon" startTime="9.356" stopTime="156.674">
            <label>Ms. Marsha S. Berzon</label>
            <text syncTime="9.356" offset="186757">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.139" offset="197833">The 1980 ERISA amendments set up a complicated, complex scheme for assuring the long-run stability of multiemployer plans, pension plans, when employers for many perfectly valid reasons, legal reasons, cease making contributions to the plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.191" offset="266065">That scheme requires that some but not all withdrawing employers make withdrawal liability payments in amounts that are dictated by the statute under a periodic payment scheme that can extend for as long as 20 years, and that is also largely dictated by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.412" offset="334924">The question before the Court in this case is when a cause of action to collect one or more of those unpaid withdrawal liability payments accrues under the 1980 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.111" offset="385706">The answer to that question in our view is rather simple and straightforward, and it depends on two fundamental principles of statute of limitations law.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.106" offset="421755">The first, and on this point I don't think there's any dispute among the parties, is that ordinarily a limitations period runs from when a cause of action accrues, and in this statute that's made quite explicit by 1451(a), and that means when the plaintiff can first file a lawsuit, not before.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.568" offset="503570">The statute here so states in 1451(a) that the... there's a cause of action... in 1451(f), I'm sorry, that the limitations period runs from when the cause of action arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.248" offset="550277">The second principle, and here the consensus among the parties I think somewhat collapses, is that a plaintiff's right to file suit ordinarily is triggered by some breach of duty by the potential defendant as defined by the relevant legal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.067" offset="609523">Here that's the 1980 act, and the rules that it sets up for determining when the defendant, potential defendant, the employer in this case, is required to make payments, so unless one knows when the employer has breached a legal obligation one really can't make a sensible decision about when the statute of limitations starts to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.462" offset="691130">That is, there has to be a situation in which a court could issue a corrective order in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant in order for a cause of action to accrue, so the limitations decision is really the flip side of a set of understandings about what obligations, duties, and rights the statute sets up to begin with and can't be looked at in isolation.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="156.674" offset="775975">Does interest run on withdrawal liability?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="marsha_s_berzon" startTime="160.598" stopTime="178.109">
            <label>Ms. Marsha S. Berzon</label>
            <text syncTime="160.598" offset="791649">Interest runs on withdrawal liability payments, but in an odd way that was described by this Court in Schlitz.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.442" offset="823100">That is, once the demand has been made, once there has been an assessment and a demand and a stated period in which the payments have to be made, then interest runs on payments--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="178.109" stopTime="181.192">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="178.109" offset="861761">So interest would not run from the date of withdrawal.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="marsha_s_berzon" startTime="181.192" stopTime="330.917">
            <label>Ms. Marsha S. Berzon</label>
            <text syncTime="181.192" offset="874091">--It doesn't run from the date of withdrawal, and if the fund does not assess the withdrawal for some period of time it runs only, as described by this court in Schlitz, as if the payment was made on the first day of the date following withdrawal no matter when they're actually made, even if it the demand isn't to make them until sometime later.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.255" offset="950369">So to apply these general principles to this case, there are really three factors that are the most important.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.720" offset="984223">The first is that the withdrawal itself is not a violation of any legal obligation, ceasing to make contributions is not the violation of any legal obligation, and that the date of withdrawal is often determined after the fact by a set of events that occur after what is later decided to be the date of withdrawal.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.793" offset="1064472">So the date of withdrawal is really a datum in a bunch of calculations, and not a date on which an employer is supposed to do anything, and what that means for purposes of the limitations inquiry here is that if the fund had tried to sue the employer on the date of withdrawal they would have been summarily dismissed from their lawsuit because no demand had been made for payment and the employer had no obligation to pay anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.060" offset="1165513">The second critical factor is that the employer does violate the statute once it fails to pay any withdrawal liability payment on the schedule that is set by the fund in the demand letter, again largely prescribed by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.145" offset="1249837">That is the schedule and the amount both.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.478" offset="1259241">So what we have here is sort of like a... any bill, like a telephone or a credit card or a legal bill or a hospital bill in which there is a liability that is incurred regarding facts that occur on a certain date, but until you get a bill that requires you to make a payment there's no obligation to pay, no obligation that has been breached, and no potential lawsuit until that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.506" offset="1367283">And this rule is a rule that, although the employer in this case seems to take issue with it, is one that has been understood by hundreds of courts over hundreds of years, including this Court in a series of cases including Rawlings v. Ray and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.859" offset="1436769">That is that ordinarily when you're dealing with a debt a cause of action accrues on a date that there is an obligation to pay the debt, and--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="330.917" offset="1472922">So under your view, I mean, there would be a separate cause of action for each instalment payment.</text>

            <text syncTime="336.828" offset="1496641">--Well, that's correct as well, although it was the third point that I was going to make, and--</text>

            <text syncTime="343.283" offset="1522450">And that means that in theory it could continue on for 26 years or so.</text>

            <text syncTime="349.677" offset="1548050">--There are two things to be said about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.229" offset="1558186">One is that the reason, of course, why it is possible that there could be suits for failure to pay, make payments for a long period, is because Congress allowed a long period in which these payments to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.490" offset="1615237">In other words, Congress could have required that the payment be made up front, but in fact, and largely for the benefit of employers and so as not to require them to make huge payments immediately--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="378.239" offset="1662258">And I suppose if there's an early default the plan's sponsor could accelerate the balance.</text>

            <text syncTime="382.902" offset="1680857">--Correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.212" offset="1682111">This provision has an express permissive acceleration clause which says that the plan's sponsor may accelerate upon a default as defined in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.371" offset="1726832">The statute defines default in a particular way so that there needs to be a notice, first, of delinquency and then 60 days from that notice before a default could be declared.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="406.740" stopTime="416.837">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="406.740" offset="1776256">So under your theory the statute of limitations in this case would have started to run 6 years after the nonpayment of the first instalment.</text>

            <text syncTime="416.837" offset="1816694">On the first instalment, and on each instalment as it came due, because the debt was not in fact accelerated and because of the additional fact that under the more specific aspects of the statutory scheme it actually could not have been accelerated because although, as I said before, there is a permissive acceleration clause, it was not operative during the relevant periods in this case, and it wasn't operative because first it was too early, that is, the 60 days had not run at any period of time outside--</text>

            <text syncTime="1122.927" offset="4641053">And that makes a lot of practical sense, because what you... what the plan often wants to do is make the payment due on the same day that the payments normally were due before the withdrawal, or on some day that's convenient for accounting purposes, as opposed to being tied to a specific thirtieth or sixtieth day from the date of demand, which would unduly constrain either the date you want to send the notice or the date that you set the payment to be due, so we think the best reading is--</text>

            <text syncTime="3277.841" offset="13260625">I'd like to address two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.961" offset="13277134">First, it's important to be clear that... and I think it is clear that this is a statutory obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.228" offset="13306183">That is, the schedule is a statutory obligation, and the employer, while it has the option to prepay under 1399(c)(4), it doesn't have the option to not pay and say that it has chosen a total payment option but it isn't doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.129" offset="13377863">The statute isn't set up that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.041" offset="13381415">The statute is set up with a baseline obligation to pay on a schedule, a periodic payment basis, and the only way that the employer doesn't have to meet that payment-by-payment obligation is if it prepays the entire amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.801" offset="13440452">This employer has not prepaid the entire amount, and therefore it had a prepay... a payment-by-payment obligation which was not contractual, which should not depend upon it making the first payment at all, but which went into effect with the demand letter and stayed there for the entire period that the payments were due.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.663" offset="13507952">That's the first point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.524" offset="13515371">And the second point is, which is related, is to respond to Justice Breyer's dealing with this case in particular, and I would agree with perhaps the slight twist in the explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.684" offset="13576080">On page 24 of the joint appendix the demand letter does, indeed, say that $45,570 can be paid within 60 days after the receipt of this letter, which was actually probably sometime after February 10 would have been due, and then says that there is an option to make a payment-by-payment instalment instead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.121" offset="13689765">If, in fact, for all the reasons we stated, it is the payment-by-payment obligation which is the statutory obligation, and absent a permissive acceleration by the fund at a time when it can make the acceleration, which it couldn't here, that's the only obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.225" offset="13758206">But if somehow one thought that there was another obligation, i.e., a lump sum payment, we know when that was one due, and it was due within the limitations period, so there's no way to take the failure--</text>
