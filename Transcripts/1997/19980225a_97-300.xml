            <text syncTime="8.670" offset="34586">It has been said that the principles which guide this Court's habeas corpus jurisprudence are finality, federalism, and fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.776" offset="63007">In 1996, Congress conducted its own assessment of those principles and recalibrated the instrument of statutory habeas corpus in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, so now there is a fourth principle which might be called fidelity which must be applied here, by which I mean that this Court, as the supervisor of the lower Federal court system, must ensure that the lower courts are faithfully applying the plain meaning and clear intent of that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.593" offset="170318">It is critical to read this statute on its own terms, because we sometimes find that we have in effect new wine in old bottles, the same concepts but with new meaning and, therefore, we have to read the statute very, very carefully to understand what exactly it is that Congress was doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="74.664" offset="298632">As a matter of fact, as I pointed out, the way 2244 has been modified simply expunges the concept of abuse of the writ, so that we now have in effect some very clear designations of what is a successive petition and this kind of amorphous concept--</text>

            <text syncTime="109.069" offset="436245">A Ford claim is a little different, since it seems to arise later after the conviction and the sentence and relate to a defendant's mental condition at the time of a scheduled execution, so it wasn't the kind of application that triggered abuse of the writ analysis before AEDPA, was it?</text>

            <text syncTime="133.753" offset="534988">The lower courts did not address that, but this Court in Woodard v. Hutchins did deal with a contention that the individual was currently insane as he was approaching execution.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.049" offset="1672150">It sure is second, because there was a first one and this is a second one, so it seems to me that if we're going to read the statute in that sort of... taking the terminology on its face, I don't see why your answer hasn't got to be the opposite of what you gave.</text>

            <text syncTime="1647.883" offset="6591530">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.668" offset="6602606">I think it's very important, what we've just heard here today from the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.804" offset="6619115">They agree that second or successive in 2244(b) cannot be read to mean any numerically second petition is out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.393" offset="6653492">That's just what Mr. Ferg told us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.512" offset="6661956">So what that means is now we've got to construe the statute, and that's what we have been asking this Court to do, and that's exactly what the court of appeals did below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.800" offset="6699154">The next thing that Mr. Ferg told us today is that we can agree that a claim that can't be presented is not presentable, does not fall within 2244(b), that that type of claim will not be considered a second or successive when that petitioner comes back to this Court, comes back to the district court in a numerically second petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.035" offset="6800091">That's exactly what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.651" offset="6810540">This is a claim that the State of Arizona said in the lower court at the time of the first petition was not presentable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.307" offset="6845127">They told the district court that there was no case or controversy, no jurisdictionally sufficient case to have that litigated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1723.966" offset="6895804">That's exactly right, Your Honor, and that's what the court decided and it dismissed it without prejudice and everybody knew that, at the time of that dismissal, if Mr. Martinez-Villareal were to lose, ultimately... remember, at that time he had won on an ineffective claim at sentencing, which the court of appeals later reversed on a procedural default, but everybody knew at that time that Mr. Martinez-Villareal would be back if, in fact, he didn't prevail in the court of appeals to litigate this very claim that everybody agreed he could litigate at the proper time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.020" offset="7027984">Now, what the court of appeals did in construing this language agreed that this type of claim does not fall within second or successive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1854.351" offset="7417313">I find it difficult to square that premise with the text of 2244(b), which in (b)(2)(B) obviously envisions situations in which, even though you couldn't have raised the claim before, the claim is barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.562" offset="7490247">It makes only one exception to that, and that is if the claim couldn't be raised before and also is a claim that would establish the innocence of the underlying offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3341.756" offset="13366962">In Kuhlman v. Wilson, going back all the way to Sanders, this Court said that a successive petition raises grounds identical to those raised and rejected on the merits in a prior application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.397" offset="13413564">Here, we look at 2244(b)(2) that says that a claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application that was not presented, therefore it is plain that Congress was using second or successive in a form and meaning entirely different from this term of art that you had in Kuhlman v.
