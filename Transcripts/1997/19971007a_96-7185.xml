            <text syncTime="8.754" offset="168828">Mr. Oren.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="c_richard_oren" startTime="10.189" stopTime="139.407">
            <label>Mr. C. Richard Oren</label>
            <text syncTime="10.189" offset="174575">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.324" offset="191084">This case comes before you today as a result of the dismissal of an indictment by the District Court in the Northern District of Indiana in April of 1995, prior to the taking of any evidence in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.435" offset="255555">However, the challenge to the sufficiency of the... of the indictment actually began many months prior to that in an official conference I had with Mr. Bates in my office.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.612" offset="312188">At that time we went over the indictment paragraph by paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.397" offset="331310">At the end of that process, Mr. Bates thought for a minute; he looked at me, and he said: Yes, but what is it they're telling me I did wrong?</text>
            <text syncTime="62.490" offset="383764">And I said: Well, Mr. Bates, I believe that they're saying that you misapplied Federal student loan funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.727" offset="412707">Mr. Bates thought about that for a minute and then he said to me: Yes, I understand that, but what is it specifically they're saying I did that was illegal?</text>
            <text syncTime="83.654" offset="468400">And I went back and I looked at the indictment and I found that I could not really answer that question for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.908" offset="497448">I believe that exchange underscores the importance of this Court's standard for judging the sufficiency of an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.799" offset="544991">That being that all elements of the offense charged must be stated and that the indictment should fairly inform the defendant of the charges against him, as well as be sufficiently specific to stand as a bar to further prosecutions should there be a conviction or an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.433" offset="643525">So what I'm asking of this Court is to strictly examine the indictment that was brought before Mr. Bates... that was brought against Mr. Bates.</text>

            <text syncTime="139.407" offset="691382">When you... you say strictly examine, Mr. Oren, are you suggesting some extremely skeptical scrutiny of the language of an indictment?</text>

            <text syncTime="150.548" offset="735999">No, not extremely skeptical, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.398" offset="747388">I... I believe I'm using that in the sense that prior to evidence being taken, the only thing we have to look at is the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.724" offset="796707">If... if there was dismissal after evidence had been taken, then I think that if there was no prejudice shown, then if the indictment was not sufficient, it would still not really--</text>

            <text syncTime="185.536" offset="875911">--That's... that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.554" offset="879986">The indictment here is set forth in the joint appendix at pages 2 through 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.843" offset="921155">It is actually structured in two portions.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.314" offset="939022">The first portion is a series of basic background factual allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.218" offset="966608">And the second portion are 12 specific charging counts, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.222" offset="994611">Directing the Court's attention to the first, the factual allegations, it provides, first of all, various background information and then some specific allegations of conduct against Mr. Bates... or by Mr. Bates.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.718" offset="1076635">As a background information, it... it alleges that a James and Laurenda Jackson owned the Ax... Acme Institute of Technology.</text>

            <text syncTime="245.926" offset="1117491">Now... now, Mr.... Mr. Oren, the question presented here in the petition for certiorari is whether intent to injure or defraud the government is an element of the offense of knowingly and willingly... willfully misapplying Federal student loan funds, in violation of the statutory section.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.702" offset="1180603">And I... I think the... the government apparently agrees that the indictment does not contain any allegation that it was done with an intent to injure or defraud the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.410" offset="1227414">So the question we have before us, as I would understand it, is: Is that an element of... of the offense?</text>
            <text syncTime="280.516" offset="1255835">And I don't see why we need to be concerned with the various detailed allegations of the indictment.</text>

            <label>Mr. C. Richard Oren</label>
            <text syncTime="285.985" offset="1277674">My reasoning for bringing this to the Court's attention is that the... again, the sufficiency of the indictment depends, I believe, on the actual setting forth of the elements of the offense in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.980" offset="1341726">And--</text>

            <text syncTime="305.899" offset="1357400">It's a very precise issues that's... that you have presented in the question for certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.402" offset="1383417">Assuming, then, that the government is agreeing that there is no factual allegations alleging... of the elements of the... of the offense, as we believe it to be--</text>

            <text syncTime="369.822" offset="1613086">But where there is no agreement between the government and Mr. Bates is that... whether or not fraudulent intent or criminal intent is an element of the offense of knowingly and willfully misapplying student loan funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.963" offset="1957589">And your argument, as I understand it, is that "knowingly and willfully" somehow incorporates a fraudulent intent, even though the statute otherwise, in describing not merely the... in describing not the... the... the offense of misapplication, but a different kind of offense, of obtaining, refers expressly to fraud as one forbidden means of obtaining property.</text>

            <text syncTime="485.215" offset="2074617">The statute refers to fraud elsewhere, but you want us to import the concept of fraud into... into a term which, on its face, has no apparent reference to fraud?</text>

            <text syncTime="517.852" offset="2205230">I think fraudulent intent is actually very descriptive of specific intent when it comes to the use or misuse of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.011" offset="2257788">So what I am suggesting is that fraudulent intent is specific intent or illegal purpose, and that that is in fact an element of the offense of misapplication of funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="2997.255" offset="12122774">But... but... but, again, I mean, the issue is whether an intent to defraud or injure would be required, when there's nothing in the text or the history or the structure of the statute to suggest that it should be read into it.</text>
