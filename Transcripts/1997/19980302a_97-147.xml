            <text syncTime="33.252" offset="273798">The setting for this statutory interpretation case is, alas, subchapter L of the Internal Revenue Code, which contains, as this Court has recognized, highly specialized, carefully crafted rules for determining the taxable income of insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.176" offset="349553">The petitioner's position in this case is straightforward and very simply stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.451" offset="374631">In connection with a transition rule that Congress adopted in 1986 with respect to a change in the taxations methodology for unpaid losses of insurance companies, it provided fresh start relief, a very favorable provision, but excluded from that fresh start relief reserve strengthening.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.975" offset="460730">Reserve strengthening was the term of art that Congress used in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.167" offset="481524">Reserve strengthening had, in 1986, a decades old meaning in insurance tax law.</text>

            <text syncTime="112.927" offset="592492">In this case below and in the Western National case the Government conceded that the term, reserve strengthening had a clear meaning in the context of life insurance taxation.</text>

            <text syncTime="172.069" offset="829161">The... subchapter L of the Internal Revenue Code covers both types of companies.</text>

            <text syncTime="223.023" offset="1032916">Well, I thought there was a big difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.864" offset="1036260">I thought the difference with life insurance is, if I sell a policy today and I take the income in and I'm going to have to pay it out in 30 years, I use a bunch of statistical tables that tell me people's life expectancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.210" offset="1077638">If I'm in the casualty business, at the end of the year in which I've received the premium I have to make what I'd call an educated guess about how many tornadoes... there were some tornadoes, but I mean, how many houses actually were flattened and how many people are out there with television sets that they haven't put their property claim in yet, and there aren't some tables I can go to.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.822" offset="1152139">I thought people sit there and they make educated guesses about to what extent the policy that was sold in year one is going to result in a claim for that year that I'll have to pay out in year 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.701" offset="1195607">I thought that's quite a big difference, so that seemed to me difference one, and difference two is that you had a sentence in the bill that would... they have a sentence in the bill that says, in the life insurance case, you know, strengthening is... does not... you know the sentence I'm referring to.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.799" offset="1252031">It's right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.907" offset="1256420">It wins your case if you were in the life insurance, and it's gone in your case, and they put it in in the Senate in your bill, and the House took it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.984" offset="1284737">So there we are.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.353" offset="1290275">We have a difference in practice, we have a difference in language in the bill, and we have a difference in the legislative history where you won your battle in the Senate and you lost it in the House.</text>

            <text syncTime="300.734" offset="1343774">The... first with respect to the comparability of the businesses, they surely cover two different types of risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.458" offset="1374703">I think Justice O'Connor's question had to do with the nature of the reserves, and the reserves in both cases are based upon assumptions and methodologies, and that is the relevant point, because that is a point that is embedded in the definition of the term, reserve strengthening, and let me go to the question, if I may, of the sentence, because backing all the way up--</text>

            <text syncTime="326.479" offset="1446800">I think that's very important, and I think we should stay with the format of Justice Breyer's question, but just taking the first part of his question to help us to understand these things, isn't it true that in the life area reserves are usually changed because of methodologies and in the casualty area because of empirical reports that there have been... that there have been losses and so forth?</text>
            <text syncTime="344.042" offset="1517018">In the life area, people don't say, oh, you know, this policyholder has just been diagnosed with cancer, we're going to change the risk.</text>

            <text syncTime="362.232" offset="1589743">When they make a change in the life area, the normal increase is the adjustment year by year that the actuaries have built in for additional interest assumptions and mortality adjustments and so on, but the--</text>

            <text syncTime="418.089" offset="1813142">Exactly, and that's the very important point I'm trying to make, that there is a fundamental comparability and certainly Congress was aware of this, because I want to go back to Justice Breyer's question, that in the normal adjustments to reserves, things that happen without anything extraordinary, anything untoward or mischievous, potentially mischievous, and adjustments to reserves that result from changes in methods and assumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.518" offset="1914915">It's the latter item that really is the adjustment item that can produce distortion, and I think both in the context of 1984 and in the context of 1986 the well known reserve strengthening kind of standard was the protection that Congress built in to protect against distortion, to protect against anybody taking undue advantage of the fresh start rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="483.826" offset="2076143">Could you explain some of those nonmethodological adjustments in the reserves in the life insurance area that make it comparable to the kind of adjustments, nonmethodological adjustments that are made in the property and casualty?</text>

            <text syncTime="500.736" offset="2143747">The methodological assumptions happen in both cases, because actuaries determine reserves and actuaries determine formulas and actuaries change formulas and assumptions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1741.882" offset="7108371">As Judge Halperin pointed out in his dissent in the Western Mutual case, what is anomalous about this statute is not the broad mechanical rule that Congress plainly intended to apply to reserve strengthening.</text>

            <text syncTime="2569.212" offset="10417667">You... insurance companies know today that they're going to get claims coming along over a goodsized period of years, even though the claims have already been incurred, they haven't been reported, and so they provide for that with a separate reserve for that kind of a claim, that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.125" offset="10493318">And as we tried to describe in our brief, the problem with the factual hypotheticals that petitioner gives us is, they don't give any consideration to that aspect of reserves, and they're based upon what I think is fairly described as a frivolous suggestion that insurance companies have only two or three claims a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.696" offset="10571581">We're supposed to look to the broad company wide data to decide whether reserve strengthening happened under the... under the regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2650.406" offset="10742422">It would not have been unreasonable for Congress to have not provided the reserve strength... the fresh start rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.610" offset="10767290">But Congress did provide the fresh start rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.554" offset="10783068">It is unreasonable for this agency, the Internal Revenue Service, to have cut back that rule in a way that frustrated the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.258" offset="10809818">In effect, what this regulation does is make reserves at the end of 1985 subject to the fresh start and not reserves at the end of 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.374" offset="10846285">The Congress had a very specific purpose in providing the reserve strengthening exception, whatever their purpose was for the broad relief they were providing, and that very specific purpose that it had had to do with artificial, manipulative advantage taking of the fresh start rule that they were providing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.286" offset="10917965">The historic definition of reserve strengthening, the historic meaning of that term satisfied that congressional objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.353" offset="10954223">Contrary to what respondent counsel just indicated, there was a 30-year history of the term reserve strengthening that began... it first appears in the legislative history for the 1959 act for life insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.072" offset="11013155">It is in judicial decisions, it is in regulations, it is in revenue rulings for 30 years before Congress had... had it... actually had applied it in the 1984 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.919" offset="11056518">Now, it didn't really have much reason to be in the statute before then because generally adjustments go two directions when you change methods or assumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.283" offset="11082014">They can reserve increases or reserve decreases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.274" offset="11089955">One is strengthening, one is weakening, so generally when you saw this in the statute from the '59 act it was referred to as changes in basis, which went both directions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.300" offset="11118063">But when they needed the rule that they adopted in 1984, they looked to a term of art that they understood, this term that they understood and that the Internal Revenue Service understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.284" offset="11157978">In Commissioner v. Keystone, Consolidated Industries, this Court, at respondent's suggestion, identified the term, sale or exchange, as a term of art in tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.192" offset="11197579">It is true that reserve strengthening doesn't quite go to the breadth of the term, sale or exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.337" offset="11226209">By the same token, for insurance tax lawyers and insurance taxation the term reserve strengthening has a very precise meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.570" offset="11255153">That is the meaning that Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.012" offset="11264871">To the extent that Senator Wallop indicated he had some concern about changes in that meaning, those concerns were reflected in his comments sometime after the act, but the more important point is, he expressed some concern that he certainly didn't recollect any changes in definition that occurred or were discussed by the conferees.</text>
