            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="89460">This case rises out of the burglary of some computer equipments form a school in King Country, Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.659" offset="132092">Respondent was charged with that crime, arrested and spent a day in jail before the charges against him were dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.342" offset="166782">The petitioner is the Deputy Prosecuting Attorney for the County who prepared the case against the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.960" offset="197293">In supportive promotion for an arrest warrant, she personally executed an affidavit that summarized the bases for the burglary charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.638" offset="231984">Unfortunately, in that affidavit she made a two important misstatements: First after stating that the respondent's fingerprints had been found on the glass partition in the area work from which the computer equipment was stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.353" offset="286841">She stated that he had never been authorized to entered the promises before when in fact he had been actually worked on the installation of the glass partition on which his fingerprints were found and secondly, she said that he had been identified by a person in electronics store which he asked to appraise the stolen equipment when in fact that person had identified someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.753" offset="384435">So, based on those mistakes respondent and brought to sued for damages against her, claiming that she had violated his constitutional right to be free from unreasonable seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.041" offset="433545">The petitioner defended the case on the ground that as a prosecutor she was entitled absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.823" offset="460712">The District Court and Court of Appeals rejected the defense, and we are granted certiorari to resolve the conflict in the Circuits on the basic question.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.005" offset="501463">Our cases make it clear that the a prosecutor is entitled to absolute immunity when she was acting as an advocate for the state in judicial proceeding, that immunity protected the petitioner in her action in this case in drafting the various papers that were brought to commence the proceeding and in filing those and in appearing in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.443" offset="587145">But the critical question in this particular case is whether that immunity also protected her when she personally swore to the truth of the false statements of fact in the certificate she filed with the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.732" offset="640330">When in other words she was performing the function with complaining witness, rather than that of an advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.578" offset="663736">For reasons stated in the unanimous opinion filed with the Clerk, we agree with the Court of Appeals, that in so far as she acted as such a witness, she was not entitled to absolute immunity, and therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.432" offset="723086">Justice Scalia has filed a concurring opinion,in which Justice Thomas has joined.</text>
