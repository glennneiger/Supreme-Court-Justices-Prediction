Greer.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.866" offset="3412173">Because Granberry v.

            <text syncTime="940.785" offset="3903902">But in fact, Louisiana is more generous than Mississippi and more generous in... than the Federal court in the Custis case in allowing in the first instance in a habitual offender proceeding an attack by the defendant on the voluntary and intelligent nature of the guilty plea that forms a basis for prior conviction and, likewise, in post conviction proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2895.084" offset="11721097">There's no objection that that's the question, and clearly they're not required to bring it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.998" offset="11736770">The State then argues that despite that they have the power to bring it up, and this was not an abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.093" offset="11765087">But one thing that is clear is that it is an abuse of discretion to assert an independent State ground to bar a petitioner's claim when you assert the wrong independent State ground, an independent State ground that has nothing to do with this case, or at least very little, since it had to do with Mississippi and we're interested in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.116" offset="11837185">At least that's an abuse of discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2942.496" offset="11910746">Well, the reason is because of course, as you've heard, to focus you right on it, that the question is whether the Constitution bars Louisiana from taking this Mississippi conviction into account when it increases a punishment, a matter that perhaps has never even been argued.</text>

            <text syncTime="2959.637" offset="11979291">Well, I think you can justify it in that the State of Mississippi was never given any opportunity to pass on these convictions despite the fact that Trest was on notice in June of 1979 in Louisiana that they were being used for enhancement, and he had in the State of Mississippi till 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.199" offset="12053583">So therefore you have the State of Mississippi affording this petitioner an opportunity, clearly knowing the State of Louisiana is using these five other prior felonies, and not going to the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.017" offset="12100813">Meanwhile, you have the interest of the State of Louisiana in presuming that that judgments... those judgments are valid, and furthermore, he had two options.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.055" offset="12140937">He could have either gone to the State court in Louisiana... our position is that in 1990 the claim was not fairly presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.058" offset="12168940">He could have gone back to the State of Mississippi up to the year 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.113" offset="12189211">He didn't even raise the Boykin claim until 1994.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.004" offset="12204780">Clearly, the petitioner had options in either State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.727" offset="12219617">He's foreclosed in either State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.369" offset="12226200">Therefore, there's a procedural bar in either State, and that would support the judgment of the Fifth Circuit.</text>
