            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="89004">This case concerns 20 U.S.C. section 1097(a) which declares it a felony to misapply federally insured student loan funds, knowing and willfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.718" offset="155773">The question presented is whether Section 1097(a) demanded allegation and proof that the defendant specifically intented to defraud someone, either the United States as loan guarantor or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.691" offset="227766">We hold that the government need not prove that the defendant had an intent to defraud the United States or another and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.795" offset="280116">The federally insured student loan program involved in this case works as follows: Banks lend money to students pursuing post secondary education.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.245" offset="337899">The lenders send checks covering tuition directly to the educational institution which credits the bank's loan against the student's tuition debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.268" offset="386068">The government guarantees payment of the loan to the students default, if the student withdraws before the end of the term, the school must return to the bank the unused portion of the loan, if the school does not return the money, the student and if she default, the government will be obligated to repay the loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.731" offset="487842">Defendant Bates was the chief financial officer of the school that received federally insured loans according to the indictment, Bates repeatedly diverted unused loan funds to the school's owners instead of making refunds to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.734" offset="559940">For this alleged conduct, he was charged with 12 violations of 1097(a), the indictment alleged that Bates knowingly and willfully misapplied student's loan funds but they it did not alleged in addition that he acted with an intent to injure or defraud the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.880" offset="644472">The District Court held that misapplication on the Section 1097(a) required such an allegation and therefore dismiss the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.706" offset="691806">The Seventh Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.172" offset="701628">In conflict with the Eleventh Circuit, the Seventh Circuit held that intent to defraud is not an element of the crime defined in Section 1097(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="165.081" offset="749275">Our decision today dissolves that conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.591" offset="763277">The word "intent to defraud" to not appear in the text of Section 1097(a) but they do appear in the text of a neighboring provision 20 U.S.C. 1097(d) passed at the same time as Section 1097(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="187.363" offset="838405">This Court has said in similar context when Congress includes language in one section and omits it from a closely place section of the same statute courts should not add what Congress omitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.275" offset="898068">Bates emphasized is that another statute 18 U.S.C. Section 656 which prohibits the willful misapplication of bank funds, similarly does not now contain an intent to defraud requirement but that statute, as originally written, did contain such as requirement, the requirement was dropped out during the technical revision of the criminal code.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.705" offset="1011753">Courts have continued to read and intent to defraud requirement into Section 656, concerned that without it even unauthorized loan, every an authorized loan by a bank officer might be turned into a federal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.372" offset="1082388">We assume, without deciding, that Section 656 is correctly read to retain an intent to defraud element but Section 1097(a) is differently situated, Section 1097(a) never contained an intent to defraud a requirement and there is no risk under the Seventh Circuit's contraction that near maladministration or unwise use of funds would fall within Section 1097(a)'s compass.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.793" offset="1216135">The decision affirming the Seventh Circuit's judgment is unanimous.</text>
