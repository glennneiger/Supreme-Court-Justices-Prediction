            <text syncTime="254.077" offset="1165111">As we are argue in some detail in the brief, those differences lead, I think, to the conclusion that Title IX provides wider protection even though it does not use the word agent in a definitional way as Title VII does with respect to employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.048" offset="1221013">The reason for that is that the focus of the two statutes is quite different.</text>

            <text syncTime="1247.229" offset="5137708">I think it's important to focus on the court of appeals' erroneous restriction in this case of the Court's customary remedial powers that this Court recognized in Franklin to award all appropriate remedies in a case of sexual harassment discrimination under Title IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.190" offset="5201552">The court of appeals here held that damage awards would be appropriate only if a higher ranking employee knew of the harassment and failed to stop it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.206" offset="5241571">The absence of explicit notice by a high ranking official should not automatically insulate the recipient from liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.351" offset="5274172">This is particularly true where, as here, the district did not have a policy to prohibit discrimination or a procedure for effective reporting of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1298.874" offset="5344285">The way the statute reads, it says no one shall be excluded from participation and be denied the benefits of or be subject to discrimination under any educational program or activity, not in connection with it, under, and I thought it was mainly directed at educational programs that allow sports for boys, no sports for girls, things of that sort.</text>

            <text syncTime="1344.983" offset="5528709">First and foremost, the reasons underlying the 1983 standard, according to this Court's opinions, are rooted in the text of section 1983 and its history, and the text of 1983 says any person who causes another to be... have their rights violated shall be subject to suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1473.997" offset="6044784">--Yes, but I have to qualify that there is a statutory requirement placed on the Department of Education to make preliminary steps of voluntary conciliation because of the extreme nature of cutting off funds, and what the Court has recognized is that a private damage remedy stops short of that and also serves another function of Title IX, and that's its remedial purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.091" offset="6133183">We believe that when there's a violation of Title IX, as this Court said in Franklin, the presumption is that all appropriate remedies apply and there's no basis for restricting courts' authority to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1989.060" offset="8105010">Now, the district's policy of nondiscrimination, general policy of nondiscrimination like the statute provides was disseminated to the students and to the parents in the student teacher handbook.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.094" offset="8145134">That's in the record at page 389.</text>

            <text syncTime="2011.984" offset="8196752">The real question is whether Title IX requires the district to answer, in damages, for criminal conduct of an employee when the district lacks notice, actual or constructive, of the crime, and whether the district had any hint that its acceptance of a relatively nominal amount of Federal funds would potentially expose it to limitless actual and punitive damages, potentially, and we say no for several reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="3084.070" offset="12485117">--I take your point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.101" offset="12493163">I mean, and it's true, the... there is the possibility of compliance under Title IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.564" offset="12519076">If there's... you know, it would be as if, as in Franklin, the complaint is made and the district does nothing about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.770" offset="12547916">If, under Title IX, the district is apprised of its noncompliance and does nothing about it, well then the severe sanction, you know, withdrawal of funding, would be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.417" offset="12594414">But of course, you know, what would happen in that situation is the district would come into compliance or would just decide, no longer do we need Federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.693" offset="12627537">I mean, it would be their option.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.945" offset="12632552">And so again, I think under the facts of this case the... here, the absence of a policy makes no difference whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.837" offset="12668183">Now, the other thing we need to talk about is, was this actually sexual discrimination under a policy, or under a program or an activity, and again, we say, and I'm mirroring some of the comments made in the argument before, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.941" offset="12736520">What happened here was a teacher who, to all intents and purposes was a good teacher, but who did a criminal act, who engaged himself in an act that was private, that was prurient, that was criminal, that could land him in jail and did land him in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.153" offset="12813424">That is not in any way associated with any education program or activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.608" offset="12835263">Now, what counsel say on this side is, well, you've got this sort of... you've got this sort of program and it's got to be implemented by agents, and the agent here was a teacher, and so therefore there's liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.236" offset="12885731">But if we do go back to Title IX and the congressional intent, when you look at Title IX, what they're talking about, Mr. Chief Justice, as you mentioned, is things like discrimination in funding of sports, or employment discrimination, you know, after a decision in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.197" offset="12957620">That sort of thing, which is always carried out by agents who have the discretion to hire and fire or to fund or not to fund, it's always someone who has the sort of authority that we're talking about who needs to be there before you can hold the district liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.068" offset="13013104">What happened, and what makes this case odd, is Franklin, and Cannon before it, you know, adopting a whole private cause of action and then this Court becoming in effect a legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.034" offset="13056885">We keep coming back to the Court for new rules and new regulations... well, what about this, Your Honor, and what about that, Your Honor... because now the Court is sitting as Congress should have sat before, if it wanted to find this cause of action, this private cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.241" offset="13109757">The sort of agent that they contend is making the district liable is not proper, because the agent here is engaging in purely criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.301" offset="13162002">If there are no further questions, we would ask that the Court affirm the judgment of the Fifth Circuit.</text>
