            <text syncTime="3285.738" offset="13298582">It seems to me clear the interstices of that provision, because it's designed to oust common law, you have to come in with Federal rules to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3310.743" offset="13398578">We're not going to give a remedy when the person keeps 100 percent of what, in fact, he is claiming inoperative, and therefore we're going to leave the question of what has to be, in effect, tendered and ultimately paid back to the remedy stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.853" offset="13458973">At the remedy stage, the Federal court does have fairly broad powers to craft a remedy without any violation of Erie, and therefore solve both the problem of state variation and the tender-back problem by saying it's going to be a remedial issue here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3352.321" offset="13564926">But the bottom line is that the tender-back rule is not a remedial rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.743" offset="13578614">It is a rule that serves the ends of justice and fairness, but it does so substantively.</text>
