            <text syncTime="66.707" offset="412957">When there is case law in the Federal courts, as there was on all of the Federal claims that ICS pled in this case, we can review that case law, and we can make a determination whether we should litigate or whether we should settle.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.640" offset="476696">In State court, because the cases are not so frequently litigated there, there's a paucity of case law on some subjects.</text>

            <text syncTime="111.830" offset="593411">Respondents sought to have the ordinance declared... the landmarks ordinance declared unconstitutional, to have the specific ordinance delegating ICS's property as a landmark declared unconstitutional, to have a variety of State law claims litigated in the first instance, they had takings claims, nondelegation claims, vested rights... they had five State law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.398" offset="695707">They also had two claims that were presented on the administrative record, so there were a variety of claims.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="144.941" offset="725904">But to the extent this was brought as a review of a municipal agency decision, to the extent that this was a review of the decision of the Landmarks Commission, I was struck by the comment that the Ninth Circuit made in its recent decision that the prospect of a Federal court sitting as an appellate court over State administrative proceedings is rather jarring.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.665" offset="832797">Indeed, it's so jarring that I don't know of any instance of a court other than this Court sitting in direct review of a State court proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="196.217" offset="931018">They are unlike this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.873" offset="937601">Of all the recent courts of appeals cases only this one was removed to the Federal court on the basis of Federal questions.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="205.199" offset="966962">But my question was the function of lower appellate courts vis-a-vis State agencies, and even in the Federal question domain, I know of no precedent where a district court, or even a court of appeals, sits as an appellate reviewer as distinguished from... a case might come up, say on habeas, on collateral review, but to my knowledge only this Court, from the highest court of the State, acts in the direct review line, so I don't know any precedent for this Court, for a lower court, for a district court sitting in direct review of a decision of a State agency.</text>

            <label>Ms. Benna Ruth Solomon</label>
            <text syncTime="255.553" offset="1168314">Our argument on that, Your Honor, is in two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.099" offset="1178554">It is first that the district court had original jurisdiction over the civil claim, over the portion of ICS's complaint that fell within the district court's original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.327" offset="1235501">ICS pled numerous Federal constitutional violations, and on the strength of those Federal constitutional violations, we removed the case to district court.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="283.151" offset="1278760">But when one challenges an agency action, say, a liquor license or funeral home license, one challenges a State or local agency decision and normally brings up all possible arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.145" offset="1342708">It violates the State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.051" offset="1350335">It violates the State constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.581" offset="1356500">It violates the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.641" offset="1364755">My question really is, isn't the implication of the argument you're making today that every decision of every licensing board in every city can become... can have a right of initial access to a Federal forum?</text>

            <label>Ms. Benna Ruth Solomon</label>
            <text syncTime="321.214" offset="1431002">Our argument, Your Honor, rests on the plain language of section 1441, which permits--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="327.837" offset="1457542">Well, do I follow... I followed your argument and it seemed to me that was right.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.632" offset="1476664">Looking at 1441(c), which requires the case to be within the original jurisdiction of the district court, then all of these cases could start out... you're removing, but you can't remove what couldn't start there, so am I correct that as you read the statute any agency decision at the State level, so long as there is a Federal claim stuck in there by the plaintiff, could be begun in the Federal court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="benna_ruth_solomon" startTime="363.618" stopTime="446.507">
            <label>Ms. Benna Ruth Solomon</label>
            <text syncTime="363.618" offset="1600588">--Your Honor is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.633" offset="1604664">We certainly make no distinction between a case that could be begun in the Federal district court, or a case that could be removed to the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.380" offset="1635697">The language of 1331 and 1441 are certainly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.348" offset="1651579">But we don't think that that opens the floodgates, for a variety of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.924" offset="1669865">First of all, as Your Honor points out, there has to be at least a substantial Federal question in the case, something that would make it a civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.342" offset="1707482">Now, we rely on the presence of the substantial Federal claims in this case to say that this was a civil action within original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.806" offset="1753353">We then turn to section 1367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute, which provides the district court with additional supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are related to the claim within the original jurisdiction of the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.581" offset="1828481">Now, in the other cases, the other courts of appeals cases that went... that were removed on the basis of diversity, that element might well be lacking.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.559" offset="1872366">We don't make an argument here about the diversity cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.027" offset="1886264">Our argument is that, under the plain terms of section 1441, the Federal allegations in this complaint were a civil action within original jurisdiction--</text>

            <text syncTime="466.592" offset="2012487">It was... under the terms of the administrative review law at that point, it was a proceeding to review a final decision, and the Illinois supreme court has made clear, and the Seventh Circuit discloses this in its opinion, that under Illinois law additional claims may be brought to the circuit court along with the claims for administrative review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1185.974" offset="4890032">Ms. Solomon, in the Stude opinion at page 581 the Court says, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa does not sit to review on appeal action taken administratively or judicially in a State proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.669" offset="4952830">Now, do you agree with that, or do you want us to repudiate that?</text>

            <text syncTime="1242.606" offset="5116566">Stude was a case about de novo review, and the Court subsequently made clear in Horton that any case that does require de novo review is within the original jurisdiction.</text>
