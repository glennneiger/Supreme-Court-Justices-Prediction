            <text syncTime="29.771" offset="261905">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.462" offset="264726">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="32.392" offset="272458">It's Cass County's position in this case that the alienable land patented in fee by the Federal Government and subsequently reacquired in fee by the Indian tribe is subject to State and local taxation absent treaty or statutory exceptions to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.285" offset="339959">In 1889, Congress passed the Nelson Act, which provided for the complete cession and relinquishments of lands to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.361" offset="380292">The Federal Government in turn, pursuant to section 3 of the Nelson Act and in conformity with section 5 of the General Allotment Act, issued individual allotments to Indians in conformity with the section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.043" offset="447061">Pursuant to sections 4 and 5 of the Nelson Act, they sold pinelands, which were basically timberlands, on the open market to individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.498" offset="488857">Pursuant to section 6, they issued homestead patents, or gave patents in fee under the Homestead Act to various individuals, again on the open market.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.609" offset="541311">In 1993, Cass County began taxing all of the above lands and that was following the 1992 Yakima decision which was set forth by this case... 1992, Yakima County v. Yakima Indian Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.723" offset="621768">At that time, there were 21 parcels, 13 of those parcels involved a lot of land, and that issue has already been resolved in the Eighth Circuit, and it was a petition for further review of that, and that was denied on cross petition for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.916" offset="702538">So at issue here today are the pinelands parcels, seven of those, and one homestead parcel.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.851" offset="726258">These various parcels, I'd point out to the court, are now... the ones that are left, they're all in trust at the present time, have been placed in trust and I believe it's a matter of public record since about 1995.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.051" offset="787071">Why we're here today, there's still the issue of back taxes that were sued for.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.104" offset="815283">In addition, obviously, both sides want to know how to deal with lands--</text>

            <text syncTime="207.333" offset="972122">They've subsequently been put in the trust, and in... obviously the period that we were taxing them was while they were being held in fee, up and until they were put in the trust, and once they're put into the trust there's no dispute that we cannot tax them.</text>

Meath, which was decided in 1906, and decided also by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1364.866" offset="5602274">I think there was an implication made to the Court that that section somehow granted taxing jurisdiction to States and counties over land by negative implication.</text>

            <text syncTime="1398.159" offset="5735498">The first one probably is that that kind of a negative implication would be completely antithetical to the philosophy that was behind the adoption of the Indian Reorganization Act and the promotion of tribal independence and self sufficiency that forms the basis of the act and the rebuilding of the reservation land base that, at least partially, that act was all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.405" offset="5832465">The second thing I would point out is that, in fact, this Court has addressed the negative implication question in the past in a decision that was issued in 1973, Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.953" offset="5886695">The Court had an opportunity to look at the legislative history and the wording of the trust provisions of the Indian Reorganization Act and the Court there specifically said that there was nothing in that act or its history which indicated an intent on the part of Congress to remove the traditional tax exemptions that tribes had within reservations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3080.375" offset="12464328">A couple of things, I guess, one just on the Burke Act, just to comment on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.910" offset="12490450">The Burke Act needed to say that the land given and early fee patented was taxable, because if it hadn't said that, I submit to the Court, there was still that provision out there that had the 25-year trust period, and that would have meant that the land would have become alienable, not taxable to the... at the end of that 25 years, so the Court had to... I mean, the proviso needed to say that for the early fee patenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.396" offset="12584387">I think that clears that one up, and... hopefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.927" offset="12598597">Also, she... you know, the U.S. referred briefly to section 3 of the Yakima decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.122" offset="12631302">Well, that dealt with the excise tax, and we're not here about that today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.456" offset="12644677">We're here on land, and I think the rest of the Court's decision dealt solely with land, and those taxes are certainly distinguishable from this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.841" offset="12686160">And one final thing, the New York case that was cited several times here, that involved the nonintercourse act, but in that New York case there was never any act of Congress to sell those lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.072" offset="12747077">Those lands were aboriginal lands that were just merely put on the tax roll, and so--</text>

            <text syncTime="3164.531" offset="12800994">That's correct, and it would be our position that the nonintercourse act applies to lands that have never been alienable.</text>
