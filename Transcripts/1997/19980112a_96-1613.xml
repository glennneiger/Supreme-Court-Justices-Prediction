            <text syncTime="71.111" offset="432173">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="77.422" offset="457355">On the date of his death Francis Romani owned real property worth about 50,000 dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.622" offset="486194">That property was subject to a private judgment lien and to a laterfiled Federal tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.964" offset="511585">Both of the liens were for amounts that exceeded the value of the estate, and the estate therefore brought this case to determine whether the claim of the United States or the claim of the private judgment creditor should be paid first.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.146" offset="568323">The answer to that question appears in the direct text of what is known as the absolute priority statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.657" offset="594341">Since 1797, that statute has provided a simple rule for the narrow category of cases in which the United States seeks to recover a claim against an insolvent estate.</text>

            <text syncTime="127.996" offset="659648">Until the revision of the statute in question, which I think was 1982, it talked in terms of debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.274" offset="696846">3713(a) at page 2 of your brief talks about claim, and it seems to me that a... that the word claim may be quite different than debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.346" offset="753061">Claim sounds to me as... has the connotation of something that's not... that's ambulatory, or that hasn't been executed yet, whereas debt sounds as if it's something that's fixed.</text>

I may have the wrong case, but I think it's United States v. Moore where the Court said that whether the claim is unliquidated or not, it's still covered by the absolute priority statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="249.588" offset="1146048">The Pennsylvania supreme court said that it did, and we say it doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.415" offset="1161408">The rationale of the Pennsylvania supreme court was that this tax lien statute provides a limitation on the effectiveness of the Federal tax lien, and that by limiting the validity of the lien, you limit the priority of the United States, but in United States v. Key and United States v. Emory the Court said that only the plainest inconsistency between two statutory schemes would justify disregarding this ancient and clear command that the United States be paid first.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.622" offset="1282198">There is no claim inconsistency between these statutory schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.713" offset="1298603">The absolute priority statute is a priority statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.978" offset="1311664">It does not require any lien of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.617" offset="1326188">In United States v. City of New Britain, and United States v. Vermont, this Court held exactly that, that the right of the United States under the absolute priority statute exists wholly without regard to the existence of any lien.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.141" offset="1404242">Well, why would that have been necessary if the only holding of the case was that it's governed by the absolute priority statute?</text>

            <text syncTime="324.356" offset="1445097">The absolute priority statute did not, by its terms, apply, and the very important part of that opinion for this purpose is what the Court went on to say about how the Tax Lien Act applies in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.428" offset="1493372">What the Court said was, the Tax Lien Act only determines the validity of the Federal lien.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.580" offset="1534018">It does not set a priorities, it is a lien statute, and the Court said that to determine priorities we look to the background common law rule of first in time is first in right, unless that has been modified by statute, and the Court pointed out that in the insolvency situations to which the absolute priority statute applies, it has been modified by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.633" offset="1626283">Congress provided specifically since 1797 that in the narrow category of cases involving insolvent estates the United States is to be paid first.</text>

            <text syncTime="393.327" offset="1721055">Congress specifically has provided that bankruptcy cases are to be determined not under the absolute priority statute but under the priority provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.385" offset="1757208">It's not illogical for Congress to determine that one set of priority rules apply in one context and a different apply in different contexts.</text>

Moore, and all the way back in 1824, I think, in the Bank of North Carolina case, the Court said that whatever the common law rule is, this priority of the United States arises solely by statute, and it is interpreting that statute that the Court has said, seven times since 1817, that a general lien such as a judgment lien, or a State and municipal tax lien, or a landlord's lien does not prevail against the absolute priority of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.580" offset="5566070">And in City of New Britain they said we don't need a lien in these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1667.220" offset="6816604">If I may, I would like to start with the question posed by Justice Stevens, which is whether antecedent security interests, traditional security interests survive assertion of the priority of the United States Government under the priority statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.384" offset="6885254">We did not handle this case below, and cannot tell the Court, therefore, why it was not discussed below, but I can and do say that it is clearly embraced within the question presented by the Government in its petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.035" offset="6939798">That is why they argued this issue at pages 9 and 10 of the petition, and why they reargued it at pages 14 and 16 of their opening brief on the merits here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.829" offset="6983056">The statute under which the Government claims priority had its origins in the prerogative of the Crown for the payment of debts due to the sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.901" offset="7031331">When it was enacted, there was more than a century of English precedent to the effect that antecedent security interests would survive assertion of a priority under the prerogative of the Crown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.097" offset="7096114">I would urge this Court to revisit your early decisions and those of some of the lower Federal courts at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.312" offset="7140941">It is old learning, but it demonstrates quite clearly that there is not an unbroken line of authority from Thelusson v. Smith to modern times, as contended by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.868" offset="7203216">Thelusson was decided in 1817.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.039" offset="7219830">11 years later, this Court decided Conard v. Atlantic Insurance Company, stating, and it was essentially the same Court, that Conard should be limited... or, excuse me, that Thelusson should be limited to the circumstances of that case, and stating unequivocally that Thelusson did not stand for the proposition that a perfected lien could be displaced by, and I quote, the mere priority of the Government under Revised Code section 3466.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.821" offset="7354936">Subsequently, this Court, in United States v. Hack and Brent v. Bank of Washington, upheld traditional security interests against assertion of priority under the priority statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.658" offset="7422332">For a period of 75 years thereafter, it was the understanding of the lower Federal courts that traditional security interests would survive assertion of priority by the Government under this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2605.018" offset="10567788">The Government says, in an effort really to prove that the priority statute is really the more limited and specific statute, that the Tax Lien Act would have application to cases involving solvent debtors, where, of course, it wouldn't be necessary, and secondly in bankruptcy cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.152" offset="10640304">Contrary to what the Government suggests, priorities in bankruptcy are determined by sections 724 and 726 of the Bankruptcy Code, not the Tax Lien Act, and the Government's reliance on Terwilliger here is misplaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.536" offset="10701848">There is no reference to the Tax Lien Act in the Bankruptcy Code, nor does the Tax Lien Act apply with full force when a trustee in bankruptcy, acting under section 544 of the Bankruptcy Code, which gives the trustee status of a hypothetical judgment lien creditor at the outset of a bankruptcy proceeding, to determine what liens would survive the bankruptcy, which secured liens might exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.619" offset="10810204">The trustee would refer to the Tax Lien Act to determine if a Federal tax lien were involved, it had been perfected, but then the priorities of the bankruptcy statute would kick in to determine how these payment would be made and to whom and in what order, and in that situation, Your Honor, the Government would apply in the third category and in the sixth category, not in accordance with the provisions of the Tax Lien Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.592" offset="10930054">This is the basic structural flaw in the Government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.058" offset="10947922">If you accept this theory, the Tax Lien Act has application only to cases where its carefully crafted protections of other creditors would have no significance, and it would also be inconsistent with what this Court itself said in the Kimbell Foods case, and that is that this statute represents congressional disapproval of the unrestricted Federal priority in tax matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.452" offset="11065473">Now, I don't think that Congress took the time to craft this very detailed statute in order to have it apply only to situations where it would have no significance, and where its priorities would be rendered totally ineffective, but that is what the Government's position is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.242" offset="11144676">Going back, Justice O'Connor, to the key test, I think I've already demonstrated there is an inconsistency between the statutes, because the priority depends upon which statute is applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.533" offset="11197861">Secondly, as I've just discussed, the Tax Lien Act would be totally redundant, as would, I might add, other Federal lien statutes if the Government's theory is to be accepted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2798.814" offset="11342998">Those amendments went far beyond any issue that is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.906" offset="11367344">This Court has always been reluctant to draw any inference from congressional inaction, and I submit in this case it would be totally inappropriate to do so because of the breadth of the amendments--</text>

            <text syncTime="2821.728" offset="11434635">In fact, in the final report of the ABA, which is referred to in the legislative history, I think it is clear that the ABA at that point thought that one of the proposals that was being advanced was really to clarify that traditional security interests have always survived assertion of priority by the Government under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.046" offset="11527840">In other words, with respect to that specific proposal, which was part of a much larger package, the ABA was of the view that they were really conforming law to what traditionally it had understood to be, contrary to the suggestion in some cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.149" offset="11604327">If you look at the legislative history of this statute in terms of how the structure of the statute has evolved over time, I think it is also clear that we meet the test set forth in The United States v. Key.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.407" offset="11669319">This is a statute that started out as a means of facilitating tax collection on the part of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.169" offset="11700353">Over the years, there has been a steady expansion of the protection afforded to competing creditors, and if you look at the committee report of the 1913 statute, Congress was of the view at that time that they were putting these other creditors on an equal footing with the Government in tax matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.990" offset="11783631">In 1966, the 1966 amendments, which gave even unsecured creditors, Justice Breyer, priority over a properly filed and perfected Federal tax lien, Congress said that these amendments were designed to bring the Federal Tax Lien Act in conformity with the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, and under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, secured claims are always given preference over unsecured claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.711" offset="11910586">So I think that in terms of whether we have satisfied the standards set forth in the United States v. Key, it is clear that we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.629" offset="11954263">With respect to the cases relied upon by the Government, I want to emphasize that in the case of New York v. Maclay you had a situation of a State lien, State franchise tax lien that was designed to cover all property of the debtor that were accrued in advance of the years in which the amount of taxes were due, so you had an amount that was undetermined, you had property that was undetermined.</text>

            <text syncTime="3300.269" offset="13348784">As this Court said in Rankin, the judgment lien does follow the property and can be foreclosed, even in the case where a junior lienholder or unsecured creditor has moved against the property in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.027" offset="13427778">I submit that the Government's position in this case, and we are talking about real property, confuses what is necessary to perfect a lien with respect to that property with satisfaction of the underlying judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.380" offset="13485248">Requiring a creditor to take possession of the property or to foreclose on the lien is a means of satisfying the underlying obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.095" offset="13524118">It is not required to perfect the lien under modern recording statutes, and the only cases that would indicate to the contrary are cases that have involved unspecified personal property or real property that could not be identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.511" offset="13585767">In this case, the property is clearly identified, the identity of the lienor is clear, the amount of the lien has been established, and the property is located within the county in which the lien was perfected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.646" offset="13638325">We satisfy the test in United States/Key, in United States v. Campbell, and I submit that the judgment of the Pennsylvania supreme court should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3387.529" offset="13697780">There are basically two propositions respondent makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.310" offset="13712931">One is that the Court should disclaim reliance on a distinction that's recognized for 180 years, from Thelusson through Gilbert Associates, between a general lien that does not defeat the absolute priority of the United States and a more specific lien that may.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.993" offset="13771654">The Court has held... I'm repeating myself, probably, but I think seven times that a judgment lien is such a general lien and that the priority of the United States prevails against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.940" offset="13815435">It's said it not only with respect to personal property, it's said it at least twice with respect to real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.986" offset="13843648">In United States v. Texas in 1941 the Court said, and I'm quoting from page 7 of our brief, but I'm quoting the Court's opinion, a general judgment lien upon the land of an insolvent debtor does not take precedence over claims of the United States unless execution of the judgment has proceeded far enough to take the land out of the possession of the debtor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3445.351" offset="13929120">Mr. McCartan's point, as I recall, was that the lien in that case was not perfected.</text>

            <text syncTime="3452.082" offset="13956079">He's confusing something that this Court has made clear shouldn't be confused, and that is the standards for specificity under the Federal Tax Lien Act, as contrasted with the standards for specificity under the absolute priority statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.765" offset="14014802">The Court in Vermont and in New Britain made clear that those are really two entirely different questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.716" offset="14042596">The question under the Federal Tax Lien Act is, is there a State lien, and the answer is yes if it's become definite in terms of the name of the lienor, the amount of the lien, and the property to which it applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.522" offset="14097767">But as the Court explained in Vermont, the question of whether you have a specific lien for purposes of the absolute priority statute is a different one, and turns on whether, as the Court said in that case, the debtor has been divested of title or possession--</text>

            <text syncTime="3522.821" offset="14238932">I mean, it goes back to the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.163" offset="14244366">The absolute priority statute simply says we get paid first, and the question is, well, is there something that prevents that from happening, and the Court's answer has been, well, if the property has been taken away from the debtor, then you don't get paid first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.081" offset="14295984">If it's been taken away from the debtor by something so specific, like a mortgage, then you don't get paid first, but if it's just a general claim against that property, you still get paid first, because it's still in the possession of the debtor, and the statute says, and the Court says we obey the plain language of the statute that the United States gets paid first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.276" offset="14372784">To reach a different conclusion the Court would have to overrule no less than seven opinions over the last 180 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.695" offset="14402459">The cases that he says are his best cases for this proposition were all in the early part of the 19th Century.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.456" offset="14433492">They don't... as our brief describes, they don't stand for the proposition that he contends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.940" offset="14451465">This Court has expressly limited the application of those cases to the mortgage situation in the Maclay, New York v. Maclay, that's what Justice Cardozo carefully explained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.387" offset="14493261">The second argument that they make is that this statute, this application of the absolute priority statute somehow makes the Federal tax lien provisions meaningless, which if you think about it is a preposterous contention that has absolutely no support for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.118" offset="14552193">The Federal tax lien provisions of course apply in the ordinary situations that the absolute priority statute doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.036" offset="14579883">In bankruptcy court, for example, they will determine whose lien comes first, where it matters whether your lien came first or not.</text>
