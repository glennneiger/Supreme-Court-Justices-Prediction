            <text syncTime="939.482" offset="3905531">Your Honor, under State law... first of all, there are two taxes involved in this question, in this case, a gross proceeds tax and a severance tax, and there are actually different protest procedures for each of those taxes, but generally speaking for each tax the... Westmoreland was required within a specific period of time to file a protest and then with respect to the gross proceeds tax and the severance tax for a period of time to initiate a lawsuit in State district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1006.438" offset="4173338">Mr. Smith, may I ask you about a possibly different way of looking at the case or characterizing the claim?</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.279" offset="4200715">Up to this point we've been doing it in terms of basically a competition between two taxing sovereigns.</text>

            <text syncTime="1021.714" offset="4234465">The other one could have and in effect wants the money that the first one wrongfully took.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.974" offset="4267484">But there's another way, I think, to look at this, and that is to emphasize what I take is not subject to dispute either as a matter of the record or as a matter of economics, and that was that what the State of Montana took through its taxation was a very substantial percentage of the economic value of the coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.497" offset="4361629">They were... the tribe was able to keep, or Westmoreland was able to keep on selling it with the tax added, but in fact the ultimate party losing was the party that owned the coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.976" offset="4427562">So that if we look at it that way, what we have here is a contest between a Government which, through its taxation, took a substantial interest in the property of the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.922" offset="4479284">Now the tribe, whether you call it a taxing authority or simply the owner of the coal, wants that wrongfully taken portion of its economic value back.</text>

            <text syncTime="1104.805" offset="4566847">We know that the tax was in fact an invalid tax, so as between the State of Montana, which took this substantial economic value, and the owner of the property, the owner of the value which was taken, why isn't it fairly clear that the owner of the value taken, the tribe, ought to get it back?</text>
