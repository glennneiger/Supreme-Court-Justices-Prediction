            <text syncTime="15.093" offset="211846">At issue in this case is under what circumstances is a parent corporation directly liable through its own acts as an operator of a facility under CERCLA?</text>
            <text syncTime="27.150" offset="260120">This is a case of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.352" offset="272868">Congress, to carry out its intent to have those responsible for causing pollution at a facility responsible to remediate it created a system that holds, among others,</text>

            <text syncTime="52.183" offset="360221">Owner or operator is a defined term in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.551" offset="377671">A pertinent part of the definition, any person who operates the facility, is circular, and so according to the teachings of this Court must be given its common and ordinary meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.459" offset="429289">The dictionary definition of operate is in the context of an industrial facility any person who exercises managerial control over that industrial plant, and we think that this is the appropriate test to apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.856" offset="502954">Under CERCLA, the term any person is given a broad definition and includes any corporation, whether a parent or a subsidiary.</text>

            <text syncTime="139.872" offset="710993">Well, I'm not sure it should even do that, I mean, if our ordinary understanding of the corporate structure and reasonable investment-backed expectations is that we recognize the corporate separate entities, and we recognize that a parent can have a subsidiary and that a parent isn't liable for what the subsidiary does in normal circumstances.</text>

            <label>Ms. Lois J. Schiffer</label>
            <text syncTime="166.022" offset="815588">Justice O'Connor, what we're talking about here, and which is consistent with the common law, is what the action of the parents are as a company toward the facility, not what the actions of the parent are toward the subsidiary, and while there may be useful evidence in how the parent acts toward the subsidiary, the real question is, how did the parent company directly affect or actively participate in the management of the facility.</text>

            <text syncTime="194.541" offset="929691">I think that's helpful, and I don't think the district court did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.945" offset="951320">It seemed to me that the district court focused on the relation of the parent to the subsidiary, and a corporate veil-piercing type of analysis, and certainly the Sixth Circuit did.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.301" offset="996668">Well, let me start first with the district court, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.205" offset="1012342">What the district court did is make very detailed and extensive factual findings that included information about the activities of the parent toward the subsidiary, but was in no way limited to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.763" offset="1058526">For example, there were specific factual findings made about Mr. Williams, who was a... an employee of the parent company, and the actions he had toward pollution-related activities at the facility that was operated by the subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.224" offset="1128430">The... it's easy to confuse here, because, in fact, for much of the time at issue the subsidiary companies operated only a single facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.496" offset="1169495">Ott II operated the facility at Muskegon, Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.447" offset="1181302">For 3 years it was its only activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.733" offset="1190393">For the remaining 4 years that Ott II was active here it owned one other facility in North Carolina, but all of the evidence the district court looked at went to the facility in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.642" offset="1246086">Similarly, as to the--</text>

            <text syncTime="276.527" offset="1257579">I mean, he did discuss financial control and he discussed many things that gave me the impression the distinction between the parent controlling the subsidiary and the parent controlling the facility of the subsidiary is a distinction much easier said than applied in fact, because much of what the district judge said, it seemed to me, could be fit under the category, this parent is controlling the subsidiary.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.369" offset="1405015">--Your Honor, it may be instructive to look at some of the specific findings that the district court made, keeping in mind, again, that for much of the time, or for a substantial part of the time the subsidiary owned only this one facility, so that when we're talking about... when the district court was talking about activities of the subsidiary it was really talking about activities at this particular facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.869" offset="1506997">But for example, at petitioner's appendix 75a, where there are facts about the activities of Mr. Williams, it talked about Mr. Williams instructed Ott II officials to limit cooperation with State and Federal regulators regarding waste disposal, plainly implicitly at this facility, and to consult with CPC before responding to regulatory questionnaires or other inquiries.</text>

            <text syncTime="440.467" offset="1913357">We can get some helpful guidance from the lender liability provisions of this statute, which were added in 1996 by Congress and which defined participation in management, and what they look at is the particular act... it is Congress giving content to the concept participation and management in the context of banks or lenders, but they provide helpful guidance for any corporation that is actively participating in management.</text>

            <text syncTime="1811.103" offset="7395937">Under CERCLA, a past or present owner or operator of a hazardous waste facility is liable for cleanup costs paid by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.459" offset="7433344">The question in this case is whether a parent corporation becomes an operator under CERCLA simply by participating in and exerting some unspecified degree of control over the affairs of a subsidiary that operates such a facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.350" offset="7488933">The answer to that question, in our view, turns entirely on whether Congress meant to sweep away traditional common law principles of limited shareholder liability merely by using the word operator in CERCLA.</text>

            <text syncTime="1866.071" offset="7615784">It doesn't impose liability, as the Government would have it, on persons that control separate entities that in turn operate that facility.</text>
