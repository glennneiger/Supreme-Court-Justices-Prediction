            <text syncTime="187.843" offset="899790">I think there could be made a persuasive argument that, because of that, it is a requirement of the Privileges and Immunities Clause that nonresidents be allowed to take deductions in proportion that their New York income bears to their total income for personal expense items.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.194" offset="965200">It is not necessary to reach that point in this case, and that's particularly because the nature of alimony is very different from the nature of other personal expense items in several respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.633" offset="1014937">In the first respect, in the State of Connecticut, as well as in other States, the amount of alimony is based, must be based upon the payor's total income from all sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.142" offset="1069063">Inevitably... one case so holding is Wanatowitz v. Wanatowitz, which is found in 533 A. 2d.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.468" offset="1110337">Because of that, inevitably in the setting of the amount of the alimony my New York income was taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.142" offset="1141057">So that's point number 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.985" offset="1148371">There's a direct connection there between the alimony and my New York income which is not present if it were a charitable deduction, or a real estate tax, or any number of--</text>

            <text syncTime="314.386" offset="1406043">I believe I must say that that is correct, and it's because this statute has as its unitary basis for discrimination nonresidents and no other factor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2094.239" offset="8525455">That is, I just imagined a person at $100,000 income, all out of New York, and $50,000 alimony, and all you have to do is, you multiply by 4 percent, and that person is paying, what, 4 percent times 50,000 I guess is $2,000, and then apply your formula, and your formula will be [dollar]s 100,000, the total income, over Federal, minus the alimony, which will be 50, so you get a multiple of 2, and so you have the New York person paying 2,000, the Connecticut person paying 4,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="2138.840" offset="8703819">I mean, what will happen is the New York person on [dollars] 1,000 will pay... let's say, if it's 10 percent, they pay 1,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.384" offset="8725971">You'd have to multiply by a multiple of 10, and you would discover that the Connecticut resident has a $10,000 tax in New York, or if it's 8 percent, $8,000, and his real income is 10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.514" offset="8786470">Am I wrong in those?</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.074" offset="8788769">I mean, I just... all I did was apply the formula, you know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.478" offset="8798382">I took the formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.497" offset="8802457">It says, he has [dollars] 100,000, he has 90,000 alimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.421" offset="8818131">For New York purposes, he has [dollars] 10,000 income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.222" offset="8829311">He pays, let's say, 8 percent, or 10 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.605" offset="8838924">That's [dollars] 1,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.695" offset="8843208">Then it says you're supposed to take the New York total, which is [dollars] 100,000, right, and then you have in the... that's the denominator, his Federal, but not counting alimony, so that's 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.546" offset="8898692">So 100 is 10 x 10, so you multiply 10 times the New York tax, and you discover you've got [dollars] 10,000 in tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="2210.810" offset="8991688">Now, am I wrong about the ease of doing that, or is there some justification for that, or is it just bizarre that a person would have, say, half his income in alimony and yet all of his income out of New York, or that he could have a bad year, or what?</text>

            <text syncTime="3128.571" offset="12662728">We'll tax you on your net income, but we're not going to let you take into account either losses or deductions arising from expenses in out-of-State businesses over which we have no jurisdiction, and we're also not going to take into account personal expenses that you may incur in your personal life in some other jurisdiction, even though with respect to people who reside in New York we will allow them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.406" offset="12758128">New York has believed and continues to believe that that is a substantial justification and a legitimate reason for what New York has done in this case.</text>
