            <text syncTime="8.920" offset="183583">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors, may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="12.027" offset="196017">The narrow issue presented by this case is whether or not a simple exculpatory no, unelaborated upon in any way, is actionable under 18 United States Code 1001.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.803" offset="243142">The answer to that question is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.225" offset="252755">It was never the intention of Congress that it should be, and Congress' intention is manifested by the 1934 incarnation of the statute, which is basically the one that we're dealing with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.672" offset="310538">And I base my conclusions on the fact that in United States v. Gilliland, a 1941 decision of this Court, the Court held that the purpose of the statute, and Congress' intention in passing it, was to protect the authorized functions of governmental departments and agencies from the perversion which might result from deceptive practices which are described in the act itself.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="67.770" offset="418999">Well, what part of the text of the act do you rely on for the exculpatory no?</text>

            <text syncTime="72.096" offset="436239">Well, the portion of the... the text itself does not have a provision excluding from its coverage the exculpatory no.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.280" offset="476990">However, it's my position that you cannot divorce the meaning of the statute from what it was that Congress intended the function... the statute to serve and, as I say, the Court in Gilliland recognized that, and most recently in United States v. Woodward the Court again indicated that that was the purpose of the statute and the intention with which the statute was passed by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.644" offset="582525">And, indeed, I might also add that United States v. Lambert, which is a Circuit Court of Appeals case, the perversion of governmental function was characterized as the hallmark of a 1001 violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.465" offset="645741">It's the petitioner's position that a simple exculpatory no made in response to a Federal agent's question as to whether or not the individual committed a particular crime cannot have the effect of perverting governmental functioning and, indeed, following Gilliland there ensued a landscape of jurisdiction which came to be conveniently called the exculpatory no doctrine which began in the 1950's in the district courts and then the Fifth Circuit in United States v. Paternostro in the early 1960's----</text>

            <text syncTime="1772.975" offset="7239779">As to why it hasn't come up before this Court more often, I think one reason may be that the Government frequently, in exercising its prosecutorial discretion about which crimes to devote its prosecutorial resources to, frequently prosecutes, tends to concentrate its resources on criminal behavior where something more than a mere exculpatory no was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.435" offset="7329640">But even in cases where we prosecute a mere exculpatory no... for example, the Bryson case in this Court, the Woodward case in this Court... the doctrine of exculpatory no is so obscure and, notwithstanding the representation that there is some wall of authority out there by the court of appeals recognizing it, which in our view more resembles a rubble than a wall, it simply is not a doctrine that has stood as a major impediment to the kinds of prosecutions that the Government chooses to bring.</text>

            <text syncTime="2965.940" offset="12011619">And now we write a little exception into that statute which is the same in the statute as the fairly wellknown prosecutorial exception for the exculpatory no is in respect to perjury.</text>

I mean, in response to your point about abuse with respect to this statute, I mean, there... if there are unscrupulous agents and unscrupulous prosecutors, there are... there is an entire volume, title 18, that can be used in improper fashions, and we have mechanisms within the Justice Department, the bar has mechanisms, both using the criminal law and under our professional ethics standards for dealing with that.</text>
