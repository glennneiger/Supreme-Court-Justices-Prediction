            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="10.498" offset="187794">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.841" offset="201169">Constitutional principles of separation of powers govern both the standing and merits issues of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.124" offset="230322">With respect to standing, this Court recognized last term in Raines v. Byrd that the Article III inquiry is especially rigorous when plaintiffs challenge the allocation of constitutional power, yet here, in the New York case, the State, which is not even a party, has not been denied a single dollar in medicaid reimbursement and the Secretary of HHS has not even determined that it should.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.823" offset="333140">In Snake River, the plaintiffs include no entity whose taxes could possibly be affected by the challenged cancellation and they have not shown that the cancellation interfered with any transaction from which they likely would have benefited.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.234" offset="394789">On the merits, the President's cancellations violated neither Article I nor the separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.777" offset="424986">The Presentment Clause was fully satisfied when the President signed the Balanced Budget and Taxpayer Relief Acts making them laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.912" offset="457483">When the President subsequently cancelled sections 4722(c) and 968, he was not returning portions of the presented bills while signing other portions into law.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.830" offset="505130">He was implementing a limited discretionary authority to execute the law as it had been enacted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.597" offset="536268">Cancellations under the Line Item Veto Act do not prevent Congress from making whatever laws it wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.870" offset="565316">Congress could readily have exempted sections 4722 (c) and 968 from the President's authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.644" offset="596454">It chose not to do so and, indeed, it identified section 968 in the Taxpayer Relief Act as an item subject to cancellation.</text>

            <text syncTime="136.852" offset="693212">The critical reason is the point I just identified, which is in a true line item veto, which everybody understands is unconstitutional, the Congress does not retain control to determine which spending or tax items the President can't cancel.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.102" offset="754234">If the President has the authority... and this is critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.986" offset="765832">If the President has the authority to cancel a provision before it becomes a law, under the Presentment Clause he can cancel a designated tax or spending item and then sign the law and Congress has thereby deprived itself of the opportunity to create the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.666" offset="840542">Here, the President signs the law and it becomes a law under the Presentment Clause, and when he does so, if the law contains a designated cancellable item, Congress has made a law telling the President that, subject to certain determinations and certain considerations, and certain certifications, you have a single, binary choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.344" offset="935210">You can either spend the money as provided, or you can spend it for deficit reduction by putting that money into a lockbox, and in that manner the President is executing the law that Congress has enacted, not vetoing an item or repealing a provision that Congress has enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.243" offset="1006785">It's no different, I sus... I suggest, for Article I purposes, than if, instead of enacting the Line Item Veto Act, Congress had simply decided to put in as section 1 of every spending and taxing bill that it enacts what is now section 961 of the Line Item Veto Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.478" offset="1087765">It says, we have the following spending and taxing provisions, but subject to these articulable principles and these constraints, the President may decide, if he signs this law, not to do certain things.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="248.356" offset="1139278">Well, so far as the locked box is concerned, this bill is the same as a line item veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.162" offset="1166446">I mean, it's in a locked box that's going to contribute to reducing the deficit.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.105" offset="1182224">So that's not a distinction between the two.</text>

            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="261.357" offset="1191314">Well, I think the... I think it's... the lockbox feature of this, which is the feature that gives the President a single binary choice, tends to make this much less of a delegation problem under separation of powers than might otherwise exist, because in contradistinction to cases in which the Court has upheld, for example, delegation of authority to the FCC or the SEC to essentially create an entire code of conduct for the securities industry, the Line Item Veto Act is not... and in this respect I think it's unique and uniquely constrained.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.272" offset="1338958">It's not self-executing.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.863" offset="1349303">The President can't do anything with his cancellation authority unless Congress subsequently passes an act that has a cancellable item in it and does not provide that the President's authority will not be subject to cancellation.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.304" offset="1411056">It's almost the... a mirror image of the Impoundment Control Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1886.578" offset="7692147">I think it is different in certain ways, but I also think that Congress couldn't do that, either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.212" offset="7722658">If Congress were to pass an Internal Revenue Code of 1999 with a special provision saying, the President may cancel any one or more of the provisions of this law if the cancellation would raise tax revenues and not harm the United States, Congress would be abdicating its constitutional responsibility to write tax statutes, and I think the Court would say that as a matter of Article I law the Congress is giving the President something that the Constitution requires it to do.</text>
