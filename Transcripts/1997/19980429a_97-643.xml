            <text syncTime="7.586" offset="178164">Mr. Stewart.</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="9.008" offset="183806">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.952" offset="199584">To obtain a conviction under the Federal money-laundering statutes, the Government must prove that the defendant engaged in a financial transaction, that the property involved in that transaction represented the proceeds of specified unlawful activity, and that the defendant knew that the funds were illegally acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.140" offset="256322">The Government has alleged in this case that respondent violated the money-laundering statutes by engaging in banking transactions in Florida using funds that were acquired through cocaine-trafficking activities in Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.488" offset="297805">The question presented is whether venue was proper in Missouri, the place where the unlawful generation of funds is alleged to have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.153" offset="324450">This Court's decisions have recognized two principal criteria on which venue may be based.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.737" offset="346706">First, a prosecution may ordinarily be brought in any district where conduct constituting an element of the offense occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.351" offset="373246">Second, where a particular effect is an element of a Federal crime, the prosecution may generally be brought in any district where that effect is felt.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.595" offset="402190">For purposes of the present case, the crucial point is that neither of those bases for laying venue requires that the prosecution be brought in a district where the defendant personally committed an unlawful act.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.814" offset="447016">In the Government's view, Missouri is an appropriate forum for this prosecution on both of the foregoing approaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.790" offset="470944">First, Missouri is the place where conduct constituting an element of the offense, namely the drug-trafficking crimes that generated the laundered funds, is alleged to have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.714" offset="506680">Second, Missouri is the place where the harmful effects of respondent's money-laundering were principally felt, since the evil of money-laundering consists of its capacity to conceal and thus facilitate the predicate crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.652" offset="554432">Finally, trial in Missouri furthers the purposes underlying the requirement that a criminal offense be prosecuted at the place where the offense was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.498" offset="585779">Now, both Article III of the Constitution and the Sixth Amendment require that a criminal offense be prosecuted at the place where the offense shall have been committed.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.191" offset="1132574">Nevertheless, to us the crucial point is that the evil of money-laundering is not that the transactions are per se unlawful or harmful.</text>

            <text syncTime="1003.826" offset="4163091">Originally, if you go far enough back, it reflects the fact that the jury in fact supplied evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.222" offset="4192662">Later on the theory was still maintained and, as I understand it, the theory was maintained in order to prevent the Crown or later the Government from taking people from the places where they are accused of having committed a crime, spiriting them away to another part of the kingdom, or another part of the country, where the Government can, with its power, get all the evidence it wants, but where the individual is probably not going to be very effective in getting any defense evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.358" offset="4305198">Now, assuming that that... and I think that's a fair statement of at least an important historical consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.544" offset="4338007">If that is so, then it is not... not only is it, I suppose, not a positive justification for the position that you take, but it shows that the kind of evidence that you want to prove these nonact elements really is the kind of evidence that the provision is not concerned with at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.709" offset="4422644">For example, the fact that the money was counterfeited somewhere is not an important fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.126" offset="4456290">All the Government has got to prove is that the counterfeiting, the counterfeited bill was passed at the place where the defendant committed that particular crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.082" offset="4492130">So that it seems to me that no purpose within the Sixth Amendment is served by having a jury anywhere except in places where the evidence either of the cause or the effect of the crime is likely to be found, so if we get into purpose, it seems to me that purpose argues against you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.805" offset="4567049">Am I wrong in my assumption about the purposes?</text>

            <text syncTime="1114.972" offset="4607695">That is, in the instant case, for example, it's very unlikely to be a fact in dispute that the banking transactions which are alleged to have occurred in Florida actually occurred as stated in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.190" offset="4656597">It's conceivable that that will be disputed, but it's unlikely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.342" offset="4669135">What is most likely to be disputed if this case goes to trial is, first, whether the money was unlawfully generated and, second, whether the respondent knew it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.890" offset="4703408">Now, you're correct in saying that it's possible that we could prove the money was unlawfully generated without proving where the predicate crimes occurred, but certainly a very good way of proving that the money was unlawfully generated would be to prove the circumstances underlying the drug-trafficking activities, particularly in a case where the Government has already gotten a conviction for the drug conspiracy that is alleged to have generated the laundered funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1196.621" offset="4934331">First, we wouldn't be proving conduct, because it wouldn't be necessary or even permissible in a 922 (g) prosecution for us to present independent evidence that the defendant had actually committed the prior crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="1657.521" offset="6777844">The Government's essential-but-not-essential-all-the-time elements test has no objective content and, if applied consistently, will produce absurd results that violate the constitutional venue provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.410" offset="6821416">In contrast, the framework that respondent offers is the analysis that this Court has used over and over again when it has confronted a venue question in this century.</text>

            <text syncTime="1697.358" offset="6937191">The Government's essential elements test abandons this precedent and offers an unworkable result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.181" offset="6960492">Money-laundering is conducting a financial transaction under certain circumstances in the case of a 1956 violation, and it's engaging in a monetary transaction in a 1957 violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.351" offset="7013260">Clearly, the conducts that's prohibited are the proscribed financial transactions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2519.543" offset="10226007">Don't you, on your theory, have to make a distinction between aiding and abetting which, in fact, facilitates the commission of the crime in the first place and aiding and abetting after the fact of the crime that involved no pre-criminal agreement?</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.226" offset="10304688">Your theory... the reason I pose the question that way is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.428" offset="10317540">I thought your theory for reconciling conspiracy and aiding and abetting liability with the Constitution was something like this: the person charged with aiding and abetting in effect is like an agent of the individual who actually commits the criminal act, what you call the actus reis, and therefore when the agent acts, the agent is, in fact, acting for the aider and abettor, acting for the conspirator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.638" offset="10430389">That works fine, it seems to me, until you get the situation in which the person charged with what we now call aiding and abetting was the individual who, under the old law, was called the accessory after the fact with no other connection, the person in... you know, when the crime is committed in State A, the felon flees to State B, goes to his friend and says, I'm on the lam, let me hide out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.083" offset="10532162">Letting him hide out has nothing to do with the effectiveness of the crime that he committed in State B. It simply has to do with whether he's going to get caught or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.130" offset="10564345">Don't you have to distinguish between those situations and say, when the aiding and abetting is that kind of independent, after-the-fact accessory, then, in fact, you're in a situation just like this and, in fact, that would not be a basis for venue in the State of the aiding and abetting?</text>
