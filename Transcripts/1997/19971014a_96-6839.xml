            <text syncTime="58.140" offset="378416">Title 8, section 1326(a), provides for a 2-year maximum penalty if these facts are proved: 1) a deportation, and 2) a reentry without a deport... without permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.237" offset="430870">Title 8, 1326(b)(2), on the other hand, sets a punishment of up to 20 years if these facts are proven: 1) a deportation, 2) a reentry without permission, and 3) an aggravated felony conviction which occurred prior to the deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.228" offset="502759">The issue presented is, did Congress intend for 1326(b) to be a sentence provision or a separate offense?</text>
            <text syncTime="97.454" offset="535673">The starting point, of course, is the plain language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.967" offset="549779">There are three very important factors which plainly indicate that subsection (b) incorporates by reference the conduct described in subsection (a) rather than setting forth the sentence for a conviction in subsection (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="115.786" offset="609025">The first phrase that helps us is 1326(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="120.631" offset="628355">It says... is in 1326(b) which says, in the case of any alien described in such subsection, and then it says, in that case if the person has a prior aggravated felony, he'll be facing a 20-year maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.129" offset="682377">It specifically does not say, in the case of any alien convicted in such subsection and, as this Court said in the Sedima case, when Congress intended that the defendant had been previously convicted, it said so by using explicitly words like convicted or conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.709" offset="752698">Here we have no such word, so what subsection (b) does is incorporate by reference the conduct set forth in subsection (a), that you have to have a deportation and a reentry without permission.</text>

            <text syncTime="216.012" offset="1009952">I mean, I think it's a pretty normal reading, and I think we're... another factor is that the titles to subsection (b) make reference to penalties, and all the amendments to it refer to penalties.</text>

            <text syncTime="241.770" offset="1112979">--First, as to the notwithstanding question, if subsection (b) was to be a penalty or a sentence for subsection (a), it's the opposite word that you would use.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.845" offset="1153208">You would say, the penalties in subsection (a) are a result of the conviction... I mean, the penalties in subsection (b) are a result of the conviction in subsection (a), not, notwithstanding or despite the conviction in subsection (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="265.733" offset="1208796">It's the opposite signal one would give to say that (b) flows from or is a result of (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="270.748" offset="1228858">Secondly, as to the word penalty, the word penalty by itself is a very little evidence that what Congress intended was a sentence provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.694" offset="1268669">Penalty is the word signifying the result that will occur, not whether or not how you get there is through a trial of an offense, or at a sentence proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.120" offset="1306390">Penalty and sentence proceeding are not synonymous phrases.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.854" offset="1321332">Congress, when they enacted in 1952 this very statute, 1326, before the (b) part was even thought of, enacted it in Chapter 8 of the Immigration &amp; Nationality Act entitled, penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.430" offset="1375562">The House report to that statutory provision referred to the 1326(a) as creating a sanction for certain deported aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.858" offset="1421328">The word penalties is the way anybody would describe the creation of a new criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.093" offset="1446197">If you wanted to pass a law against jay walking you would say, I want to make a penalty against jay walking, and you would describe it as such, just as Congress did when they described the car jacking statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.421" offset="1487575">It was under a subtitle called, enhanced penalties for auto theft, or Federal penalties for armed robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.146" offset="1514429">Numerous statutes are found under a heading with penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.517" offset="1531983">It would be a different thing all together if there was subsection (a), offense, subsection (b), penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.603" offset="1560300">In 1988, when Congress passed 1326(b), as the Government points out in their brief, the phrase penalty was not added to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.528" offset="1596035">That's just in the codification that you see when you pick up a book.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.831" offset="1609201">That was not a congress... the codifiers added that, not Congress, so the word penalty did not become part of the statute at all, much less... even if it had meaning as a signal as to whether or not it's a sentence provision or an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.360" offset="1671268">And third, in the plain language of the statute it would make no sense for the phrase in (b)(1) that you can get up to a 10-year sentence for a felony, and then in parentheses, other than an aggravated felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.639" offset="1724453">How would that make any sense if that's a sentence... if that's just a sentence proceeding, because it would just be a gradation.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.473" offset="1747755">All of the courts below are uniform in looking at a statute and seeing... if Congress had passed 1326(b) and simply added that language to an already existing 1326(a) right at the end, and just said, shall be guilty of a felony and shall suffer a penalty of up to 10 years, or a term of imprisonment of up to 10 years, and if they have an aggravated felony it will be up to 20 years, or if it's just a felony it will be up to 10 years, that would be a signal that there's a sentence provision for the offense in (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="433.815" offset="1881084">But making it a separate subsection is deemed by all of the courts that review this as an indicator that it's an offense, especially when it's not section (a) entitled penalties, which it's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.722" offset="1924760">Then when we--</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter M. Fleury</label>
            <text syncTime="456.750" offset="1972826">--My point was that in looking at whether or not something is titled penalties, if it's in a separate subdivision, like in section... 18 U.S.C. section 1091, which says (a), basic offense, (b), penalty for basic offense, then that's a signal that (b) is to be a sentence provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.032" offset="2045968">But where it's all in one section, courts of appeals have said as to that factor, not the end result but as to that factor, that is an indication, if the penalty provision is in the same paragraph as the offense, then it's a sentence for the offense, but if it's separated out into a separate section without a separate title of penalty, then that's an indicator... it may not be dispositive... an indicator that it's meant to create a separate offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.959" offset="2149727">Such as in 2113(d), which is the bank robbery statute, and 2113 sets forth (a) that it's a crime to commit a bank robbery, and you can get up to 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.415" offset="2191523">(d), if you use a weapon or assault somebody in the course of committing (a), then it's an extra 5 years, and this Court in the Simpson case assumed that was an element, and even though it was... it... just as in this statute incorporated by reference all of the provisions of the previous statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1506.125" offset="6170390">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.288" offset="6190974">Section 1326, subsection (b)(2), is a sentencing enhancement provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.544" offset="6212081">It does not create a separate criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.247" offset="6218873">Congress enacted (b)(2) as part of a three tier penalty scheme for violations of section 1326.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.661" offset="6248548">The statutory text, structure, and history compelled that conclusion, and that interpretation does not create a constitutional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.277" offset="6278955">Subsection (a) of section 1326 sets forth the offense conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.579" offset="6300166">It also sets forth a base sentence of up to 2 years that shall be imposed on such an offender, but specifies that that provision, that you shall be sentenced to 2 years, is subject to subsection (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.958" offset="6349694">Subsection (b) then states that notwithstanding subsection (a), longer sentences are authorized in some cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.822" offset="6381146">(b) does not set forth any additional offense conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.293" offset="6391072">Specifically, (b)(2) authorizes a sentence up to 20 years for persons with aggravated felony convictions, a paradigmatic sentencing factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.790" offset="6429002">The reading of (b)(2) is confirmed by the circumstances surrounding its enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.106" offset="6458259">As Justice O'Connor pointed out, the provision in the enacting legislation was entitled, criminal penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.969" offset="6485740">That was not carried over into the codification, but it is part of the legislation that was enacted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.673" offset="6504548">Moreover, if I could draw the Court's attention to the version of the statute in effect... it's in the appendix to the Government's brief at 2a.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.019" offset="6545926">Pages 2a and 3a reflect the changes from the 1952 version to the version which enacted in 1988 that added subsection (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.268" offset="6594932">Petitioner's counsel discussed at length the fact that subsection (b) applies notwithstanding subsection (a) into the case of any alien described in such subsection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.444" offset="6639653">At the time that provision was added, Congress was looking at (a), which stated at that time that an offender shall be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, be punished, so it was quite natural for Congress to use that language at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.065" offset="6710184">As petitioner points out in his brief, later that guilty of a felony provision was dropped out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.080" offset="6730246">That was part, as we explain in our brief, part of an effort of Congress going through and changing fine provisions and various provisions of the Immigration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.955" offset="6761697">But at the time that (b) was enacted, to refer to an alien that was described in (a), it was clearly an alien who was guilty of a felony and who would be subject to a sentence of 2 years unless (b) applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.811" offset="6805165">We think that the legislative history also confirms that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.114" offset="6826377">As we discuss in our brief, all the references to the subsection (b) that was added were penalty provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.670" offset="6848528">The sponsors of the bill referred to it that way, the section by section analysis that was submitted to the Senate, and the predecessor statute, the sponsors and drafters had discussed at length the fact that this was a three tier penalty scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="1687.876" offset="6897430">May I ask, just to be sure I understand the posture of the case, the case, the hypothetical case that troubles me is one... unlike this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.934" offset="6937658">I guess the facts were pretty clear... one in which at the time of the indictment and the plea hearing, all the Government knows is that this particular reentry was made unlawfully, but the Government is not aware of prior convictions, and as I understand the Government's position, if they subsequently discover before sentencing the prior felony the sentence could go up to 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.006" offset="7017906">Now... and supposing the defendant says, no, that was my brother or somebody else, it's mistaken identity... and our cases do have some claims of mistaken identity... I take it it's your position that the Government must prove that this particular person was the same one by only a preponderance of the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1744.372" offset="7123337">But normally it's a paradigmatic sentencing factor that does not increase the range of punishment beyond the previous maximum, which was true in McMillan, for example.</text>

            <text syncTime="1755.011" offset="7165968">Here, if you... well, that's the argument, I guess, whether the maximum for everybody is 20 years, or only for those who find this out later.</text>

            <text syncTime="1765.607" offset="7208287">As a threshold matter, we would disagree that sentencing enhancements do not often increase the statutory maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.451" offset="7231693">In fact, they do, and we discussed the early recidivist cases from this Court, where it makes clear that that is not a constitutional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.457" offset="7259696">Graham v. West Virginia was the first case in 1912 that talked about the fact that prior convictions used for sentencing enhancements are not an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.171" offset="7298566">They are a distinctive factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.324" offset="7311209">They can be determined at a separate hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.346" offset="7319255">And in Oyler v. Boles, an early 1960's case, there were two defendants at issue there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.392" offset="7343392">Both of them for their instant offense were subject to much lower than the enhanced sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.997" offset="11741890">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.096" offset="11746279">The... in McMillan and in Patterson there was a clear statement that those legislatures intended the fact at issue there not to be an element, and that was a big part of this outcome of both of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.017" offset="11809913">In this case we have no such clear statement, and in... both in McMillan and in Patterson the Court looked to the fact that Congress deemed the... whether or not Congress had deemed the fact... the facts that the jury did find to be so important to create a liability for the statutory maximum punishment, and since the jury did find all of those facts, the outcome was within the dictates of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.643" offset="11900401">Here we have the question left unresolved, and that is whether a fact upon which an additional 18 years, dwarfing the possible consequences to my client other than that resolution of that fact is to be alleged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and here we do not have what was present in Patterson and in McMillan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.476" offset="11979813">We don't have the type of clear statement from Congress as they did in 21 U.S.C. 841, where they have (a), unlawful acts, (b), penalties, and 21 U.S. 851, which sets forth a sentence procedure in order to determine the prior convictions that might be used to increase the statutory maximum sentence under 841, where Congress has said as clearly as they could that the prior convictions in 841 (b) will be sentence enhancements for a conviction under (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.016" offset="12105933">That's not present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.897" offset="12113456">The traditional rule is that prior convictions used to increase a statutory maximum must be alleged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.002" offset="12145848">This Court's never said otherwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="3006.097" offset="12170298">--We... in a footnote we cited numerous, numerous cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.968" offset="12185763">That was the rule at common law, and that was the rule well into the 20th Century until very recently in statutes like 841 and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.525" offset="12224006">It hasn't changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.797" offset="12229022">That was the... as we pointed out in our brief, the uniform rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.578" offset="12244173">As some of the cases say, the precedents for this are too numerous to cite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.431" offset="12259637">That was the traditional rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.333" offset="12271235">In addition to this, this is not a recidivist statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.944" offset="12281684">A recidivist statute is something where it says, well, if you do something and you do it again you'll get extra penalties.</text>

            <text syncTime="3044.492" offset="12323794">But it requires a prior aggravated felony which occurred prior to the deportation, and it has to do with somebody who reenters with the status of a felon, just like 18 U.S.C. 922(g) is concerned with the status of the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.710" offset="12376666">It says, we want to have increased deterrence to keep felons away from weapons, and therefore it's an offense for a felon to have a weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.095" offset="12402266">Here, we... Congress said, we want to have an increased deterrence for felons who don't even belong in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.198" offset="12422641">Therefore, it's an extra offense, it's a 20-year offense for you to come into this country, and that has to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and alleged to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.763" offset="12456914">In this case we don't have any... we have no indication that the constitutional right to have a grand jury to decide whether a 20-year offense should have been filed in this case, it did not occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.189" offset="12502680">That was not presented to the grand jury, and that's the purpose of the grand jury right.</text>
