            <text syncTime="59.622" offset="390302">I have two principal points to make this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.990" offset="399810">The first is that State and regional legislators who are sued under section 1983 are entitled to absolute immunity if they acted in their legislative capacities.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.477" offset="433665">Local legislators who were sued under the statute should be entitled to that same absolute immunity if they acted in their legislative capacities.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.850" offset="463236">My second, and closely related point, is that--</text>

            <text syncTime="84.186" offset="488522">My second and closely related point is that public officials at all levels of Government, regional officials, State officials, and local officials, do act legislatively, and therefore are entitled to absolute immunity when they propose legislation, vote for legislation, and enact legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.947" offset="555605">Now, the facts--</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="101.931" offset="559575">Are you going to at some point address the court of appeals' reason for address... for your losing, which I didn't hear in either of the first two points, because I thought the court of appeals accepted both of those points.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="113.089" offset="604192">--Well, the court of appeals did accept that there is absolute immunity for actions that are taken in a legislative capacity, and we agree with the court of appeals' decision on that point, a decision that I add was endorsed by every circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.445" offset="645570">I think... I will address the second point subsumed within my suggestion that legislators necessarily act legislatively when they propose legislation, enact legislation, which is what they did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.436" offset="685590">There was a dispute in the court of appeals as to whether the legislation here was legislative in character within the meaning of the immunity doctrine, and I will get to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.858" offset="719236">As I say, the facts that underlie this are simply stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.810" offset="731043">Respondent was the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services of the City of Fall River, Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.612" offset="750269">The mayor of Fall River proposed a budget which eliminated a number of city positions--</text>

            <text syncTime="155.166" offset="772421">Can we get on to the issue?</text>

            <text syncTime="158.284" offset="784960">The reason I was touching on them simply is because I think they provide some useful context for the legal issue, but turning directly to I think what's the first underlying issue in this case, are legislators, local legislators entitled to absolute immunity--</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="171.026" offset="835951">On that issue, would you tell me your view of what the status of the common law was at the time of the enactment of the statute and, secondly, what the general rule was in the courts of appeals before our decision in Tahoe?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="185.350" offset="893211">--As to the first, I think the law, the common law was clearly settled in the 19th Century.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.904" offset="911392">I think that it was the established rule, unchallenged, that local legislators were entitled to absolute immunity for their legislative actions, for actions of the sort in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.545" offset="954024">We have searched diligently.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.028" offset="959876">We have not found a single 19th Century decision holding legislators liable for discretionary acts related to the enactment of legislation, and respondent has not cited such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.334" offset="993103">That statement of the law was reflected in the leading 19th Century treatises, for example, Cooley's Treatise on Torts, Dillon's Treatise on Municipal Corporations, which were written shortly after the enactment of section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.709" offset="1042632">Just to give you an example of a characteristic statement, Cooley in his Treatise on Torts, written in 1880, says that so far as... and I'm quoting here from Cooley.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.731" offset="1078680">So far as legislative officers are concerned, their rightful exemption from liability is very plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.051" offset="1096026">Legislatures have complete discretion in the area of legislation, and it is not consistent with this that their members should be called to account for their acts and neglects.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.455" offset="1129672">This is also true... and again continuing to quote Cooley, this is also true of inferior legislative bodies such as boards of supervisors, county commissioners, city councils, and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.578" offset="1166138">Again, we have searched diligently.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.963" offset="1171676">We have not found a single 19th Century treatise which states a contrary rule, and I don't believe that respondent has cited one either.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.916" offset="1195500">There was a single exception to this rule of absolute immunity recognized in the 19th Century, and that was for so-called ministerial acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.690" offset="1226534">There was a body of authority holding that local legislators could be called to account for failing to perform ministerial duties that were imposed by State law or by court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.211" offset="1264672">That was a very narrow and precisely defined doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.663" offset="1274494">It applied only when there was an imperative, nondiscretionary, mandatory, and precise duty, as I say imposed either by State law or by--</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="293.405" offset="1325381">Well, I think that... we have searched also and have not found a single slander case against a member of a local legislative body for statements relating to their legislative actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.946" offset="1371565">Respondent in her brief cites a number of decisions which we addressed in our reply brief, and I think that in fact none of them involve such statements by local legislators, and it was until quite recently, it may still be the common law rule, prevailing common law rule that local legislators have immunity in defamation suits for those actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.490" offset="1441783">But the important point for present purposes is that in the 19th Century so far as we've been able to determine there were no such suits, and so I think it's quite clear... returning to the ministerial point, it's quite clear that the actions here, the actions of petitioners in this case, would not have been regarded remotely as ministerial in the 19th Century, and respondent does not contend otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.452" offset="1513567">And so I think it is fair to say that the Congress that enacted section 1983 would have regarded as remarkable the suggestion that any legislator at any level of Government could be held liable for actions of the sort in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.844" offset="1567170">A Member of Congress in 1871 who looked at the background of common law would have seen that an absolute rule of liability prevailed.</text>

            <text syncTime="594.144" offset="2528372">I think that there were a number of courts, and their decisions are cited by respondent, prior to that decision which recognized only qualified immunity under section 1983 for local legislators.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.416" offset="2569436">I think that an examination of those decisions shows that they did not... I think did not benefit from the Court's subsequent decisions setting out the nature of the immunity inquiry under section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.224" offset="2620741">For example, they did not look at all at the common law history that prevailed in the 19th Century, which the Court has said is the paramount indicium here, and it's interesting that one of the decisions cited by respondents was written by then Judge Potter Stewart on the Sixth Circuit, indicating that only qualified immunity prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.702" offset="2686569">Then Justice Stewart I think changed his view, because he joined Justice Powell's dissenting opinion in Owen v. City of Independence, which stated expressly that members of city councils are entitled to absolute immunity, and so I think that the law has... this Court's immunity doctrine has been clarified and sharpened and every court of appeals has now concluded that an absolute rule of immunity is the appropriate one.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.301" offset="2777058">I should just add parenthetically that the common law history, which I think is quite compelling, is confirmed by looking at the considerations of policy that the Court has identified--</text>

            <text syncTime="832.464" offset="3481632">The two... the acts that he did, proposing the legislation and signing the legislation, are essential elements of the legislative process of enacting the law, and the Court in the Federal context has described the President's power to veto or to sign legislation as legislative in character.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.676" offset="3550491">The Court has said that that is an explicit exception to the separation of powers and the Constitution, and so in cases like Buckley v. Valeo and others that we cite in our briefs, the Court has expressly said that power is a law-making legislative power.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.132" offset="3596362">That is the very power that was exercised by the mayor in this case, and so I think that as a functional matter it was legislative, directed to the enactment of a law, and therefore he is for those actions entitled to absolute legislative immunity, and again, all the considerations the Court identified in Tenney, Lake Country Estates, point to that sort of immunity in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.528" offset="3677864">Now, if that is correct, and if absolute immunity is the proper rule for local legislators, or local officials acting in a legislative capacity, the remaining question in this case is Justice Breyer's question, were the legislators here acting in a legislative way, and I would submit that the court of appeals' approach to that has a slightly Lewis Carrollish quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.311" offset="3765009">There is no question that all of the actions taken by the defendants here, as I say, proposing the ordinance, supporting the ordinance in committee, voting for the ordinance, and signing the ordinance, were directed to the enactment of a municipal law, to an ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.986" offset="3831778">Now, the court of appeals argument, the court of appeals holding in this case, which is endorsed by respondent, is that some legislation is essentially more legislative than others, that legislation does not have a legislative quality if the sponsors are motivated by specific facts, what the court of appeals called specific facts, or if the legislation is excessively narrow in scope, if it affects only a small number of identifiable persons.</text>

            <text syncTime="1650.783" offset="6754984">The jury found in this case that the mayor of the City of Fall River and the city council vice president came up with a scheme to punish Janet Scott-Harris because she exercised her constitutionally protected right to complain that she and other minority employees of the city were being called names such as the black nigger bitch, and that... because she attempted to bring disciplinary charges against the well-connected long-time city employee who made these statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.552" offset="6873998">The mayor conceded at trial, he agreed with the trial judge that Ms. Scott-Harris' speech was constitutionally protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.039" offset="6903987">Significantly, the mayor also conceded at trial that he had authority under Massachusetts law... in fact, the Massachusetts statute was marked as Exhibit 85... that he had authority on his own, without any action by the city council, to fire, to lay off, to remove Ms. Scott-Harris from city government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.418" offset="6973472">He had authority to put somebody else into her office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.120" offset="6984235">He had authority to have other people, the people who had reported to her report to the city manager.</text>

            <text syncTime="2651.050" offset="10756003">Coffin v. Coffin was the one common law case relied upon by this Court in Tenney v. Brandhove, a libel action for statements made on the floor of the Massachusetts legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.572" offset="10802083">This Court relied upon Coffin for the position that the common law provided absolute immunity to members of the State legislature in a libel action regardless of whether they acted maliciously or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.617" offset="10862269">Well, 20 years after Coffin v. Coffin, the same Massachusetts court, the Massachusetts supreme judicial court, in the same form of action, a slander action brought against a member of a town governing board, the Brookline Board of Selectmen, did not apply that same absolute legislative immunity at the local level, but instead the Massachusetts supreme judicial court said that at the local level, in a slander action, if the person, State local official acted maliciously or abused his office, he had no immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.137" offset="10984313">So under the libel cases the immunity rules under the tort law were different for members of the State legislature than they were for members of local legislative bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.944" offset="11031543">Prosser, Keeton, Harper, the Restatement of Torts all say that that is still the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.181" offset="11052545">They all state unequivocally that the absolute immunity in libel cases for members of State legislative bodies does not apply to municipal governing bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.037" offset="11091938">That's a clear distinction in the common law, and I suggest that that distinction in the common law imposing liability at the local level to local legislators that was not imposed at the State level, and also the discretional ministerial doctrine that imposed liability in some circumstances at the local level, where there would not be liability at the State level, shows that the common law distinguished between State legislators and local legislators, and because the common law distinguished between the immunity of local legislators and State legislators, petitioners haven't met their very heavy burden of proving--</text>

            <text syncTime="3385.901" offset="13695405">I have a couple of points which I will endeavor to make quick.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.353" offset="13709198">First of all, I think the easiest way to conceptualize the question of whether this is legislative action in this case is to... and perhaps it's built on Justice O'Connor's example from Arizona... is to imagine what would happen if this happened at the Federal level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.142" offset="13752352">If the President fired the Secretary of HHS, that would be an administrative act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.779" offset="13766876">If Congress passed a bill eliminating funding for the Office of the Secretary of HHS for the next fiscal year, everybody I think would acknowledge that would be a legislative act, and that the Members of Congress would be shielded by the Speech and Debate Clause if the incumbent Secretary of HHS sued them on a First Amendment theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.020" offset="13823928">This case I think is identical to that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3424.626" offset="13850259">Second, I think that the court of appeals and respondent acknowledge that if this facially neutral ordinance had been promulgated for proper reasons, for... purely for the purpose of saving money, it would, in fact, be legislative in character.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.552" offset="13910027">Therefore, their test requires in every case of this sort that there be a... in that circumstance, absolute immunity would be proper, because it would be legislative in character.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.407" offset="13945449">Their test requires that in every case of this sort there be an examination, therefore, into the legislative motive before an inquiry into immunity is conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.994" offset="13979827">That means that there has to be discovery and a trial before immunity is decided, and yet--</text>

            <text syncTime="3465.850" offset="14015249">--Well, not if there's an absolute immunity rule for acts that are in the form of legislation, as we suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.670" offset="14042520">If, having passed a law that determines that it is legislative in character, then I think at that point absolute immunity applies, and there's no need for an inquiry into motive, otherwise immunity really becomes entirely meaningless, because in every case of this sort there will be a possibility to argue that we... there was a specific fact in the minds of the legislators, and I should be entitled, the plaintiff will say, to obtain discovery into those facts, and therefore immunity goes by the boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.737" offset="14146801">The third point, relating to Owen, which was cited by respondent, I think Owen has no bearing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.475" offset="14169685">The Court suggested, looking at the common law history in Owen, that the... there was a discretionary immunity for acts of municipalities because common law judges were unwilling to substitute their judgments, their discretionary judgments for municipal acts in areas of the municipalities' proper purview.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.900" offset="14231438">The rationale for legislative immunity is quite distinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.102" offset="14244186">The idea there is that legislators should not be... should not have distorted judgment because of fear of liability, and therefore any act... thank you, Your Honor.</text>
