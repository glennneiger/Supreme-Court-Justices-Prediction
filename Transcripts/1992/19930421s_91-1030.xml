            <text syncTime="8.694" offset="117416">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.892" offset="138209">The respondent, Williams, brought this habeas actions challenging the legality of the state convictions for murder and other offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.122" offset="167153">Williams alleged that the State Court had erred in allowing the introduction of statements solicited from him by the police in violation of his right in the Miranda v. Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.131" offset="203202">The District Court agreed and granted relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.031" offset="214800">The Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.285" offset="223786">The Court of Appeals rejected the state's argument that federal habeas review of Williams' Miranda claim should be barred under the rule in Stone and Powell, which holds that federal habeas review of Fourth Amendment claims is not available when a state has given a full and fair chance to litigate such claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.849" offset="294108">In an opinion filed with the Clerk of the Court today we affirm and hold at Stone's restriction on the exercise of federal habeas jurisdiction does not extend to Miranda claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.193" offset="335486">The equitable considerations that formed the basis for a decision in Stone do not obtain here.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.180" offset="355443">Most importantly, eliminating review of Miranda claims would not significantly benefit the Federal Courts in their exercise of habeas jurisdiction or advanced the cause of federalism in any substantial way.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.499" offset="400687">Justice O'Connor has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, which the Chief Justice joins; Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part which Justice Thomas joins.</text>
