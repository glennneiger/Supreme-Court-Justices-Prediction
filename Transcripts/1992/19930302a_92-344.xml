            <text syncTime="15.891" offset="204263">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.294" offset="213876">This case concerns the scope of the President's emergency powers to adopt measures that he deems to be necessary to prevent a mass migration of aliens across the high seas and to the ability of the alien migrants to challenge those measures in United States courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.018" offset="292766">Last May, in the first 20 days, more than 10,000 Haitians crowded into unseaworthy vessels and set sail for our shores.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.385" offset="330173">The President determined that he could not stop this migration while continuing to offer the migrants any kind of asylum screening on board Coast Guard cutters or at off-shore locations such as Guantanamo.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.073" offset="384926">He accordingly concluded that a change in the procedures was required in order to stop the migration and to save lives that he concluded would be lost if that number of people continued to flow out of Haiti in the vessels which are clearly unseaworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.174" offset="449396">He accordingly invoked his powers under the Immigration &amp; Nationality Act, which are in the nature of emergency powers, to adopt the procedure that he thought were necessary, and those procedures provided that the Coast Guard should directly repatriate Haitians without asylum screening but that persons who genuinely feared persecution should be given an opportunity to seek admission as a refugee through asylum processing at the embassy.</text>

            <text syncTime="106.192" offset="565484">Ms. Mahoney, was this directive aimed at any Haitians who were leaving Haiti, or just Haitians who were leaving Haiti for the United States?</text>

            <text syncTime="115.839" offset="604041">It's directed at Haitians who were leaving for the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.742" offset="619610">The executive order directs the Coast Guard to determine whether they have reason to believe that undocumented aliens are seeking entry into United States territorial waters, and the Coast Guard has enforced it in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.734" offset="683662">Once the procedures were changed, the exodus that had begun a number of months before was halted.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.134" offset="729220">They were effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.015" offset="732772">The problem that we face now is that the threat of the out-migration continues because the underlying conditions in Haiti that have caused people to wish to leave their country... a variety of political and economic conditions... continue to persist.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.924" offset="792331">The President has accordingly determined that in order to prevent mass migration, just as last May, and also to prevent loss of life at sea, perhaps hundreds or thousands, the policy of direct repatriation must continue, but the President has also directed that efforts be made to fully fund the asylum processing in Haiti so that those who wish to come to the United States because they genuinely fear persecution will have an opportunity to adjudicate those claims expeditiously in Haiti and flee Haiti through those orderly procedures.</text>

            <text syncTime="370.629" offset="1623234">The situation that we had before, when we were conducting screening on Coast Guard cutters and at Guantanamo, was causing thousands and thousands of people to essentially risk their lives so that they could get the opportunity to apply for asylum outside of their own country and the chance to come to the United States, even though the vast majority of those people will not ultimately be found to be eligible for asylum.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.009" offset="1732740">This unnecessarily creates the risk of loss of life at sea, and it interferes with our foreign policy initiatives, which very fundamentally depend upon bringing order and stability into that country.</text>

            <text syncTime="1295.284" offset="5321860">No, Your Honor, I don't believe that the APA is territorial only, but the INA precludes review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.990" offset="5344638">It's very much like... the provisions of the INA show that preclusion is intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.943" offset="5360416">It's very much like Block v. Community Nutrition where there is a class of... of applicants or claimants, and here it's aliens outside the United States, those who have no connection to our country or our territory, who are not given any rights... any rights of access to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.934" offset="5432410">And to construe the APA to nevertheless provide them access with the courts when it historically has never been done, seems to me to be a grave departure from our law, particularly in the circumstances of this case where it's aliens outside the United States who are threatening to migrate en masse and, in fact, were migrating en masse, and they wish to come into the courts of the United States to challenge the action of the President in responding to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.625" offset="5547140">It seems to me that even if the Court were to think that an APA action might be appropriate, equitable relief under these circumstances certainly is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.950" offset="5580472">The President has determined that the national interest here is to pursue the procedures which he has established, and to suggest that the persons who wish to avoid the 207 processing in Haiti so that they can seek more beneficial asylum procedures or what they might view to be more beneficial asylum procedures in the United States, does not strike us as equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.588" offset="5687051">As this Court noted in Webster v. Doe, the Court, when exercising powers under the APA, must determine whether the relief requested is appropriate equitable relief, and continues to have authority to dismiss relief, whether declaratory or injunctive, that does not represent an appropriate exercise of judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.223" offset="5769598">This is certainly such a case, where the President has determined that to adopt the procedures that the court of appeals has required will result in mass migration and the loss of hundreds and possibly thousands of lives at sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.914" offset="5824351">This is just not a sensible way to construe our laws, and certainly not one that we think Congress intended.</text>

            <text syncTime="1514.126" offset="6197171">No, Your Honor, I don't think we could construe it to circumscribe the President's authority in that... in that light, especially since in Knauff v. Shaughnessy itself, the President suspended exclusion hearings which were required by statute for an alien bride who was entitled to admission so that she could be with her husband, if she was otherwise admissable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.900" offset="6280240">So to say that... that the... the President's powers could suspend those kinds of procedures in Knauff but nevertheless not permit the President to adopt procedures that are necessary to protect our sovereignty and to protect against a humanitarian tragedy at sea seems to me to be an inappropriate way to construe Congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.167" offset="6373340">Particularly when we're dealing with areas of foreign affairs powers where, as this Court noted in Curtis Wright, Congress is expected to grant extremely broad authority so that the President will be able to act in the national interest without the kinds of limitations that you might have in the domestic setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.246" offset="6445647">I'd further underscore that if we were to look to the... the protocol to which certainly this Court has... has reference to inform the interpretation of 1253(h), one of the key concerns of the negotiators was that they have the ability and the flexibility to prevent mass migrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.981" offset="6528612">Because no country can readily give up that kind of sovereign power so that it subjects itself essentially to an invasion of foreigners.</text>

            <text syncTime="1633.396" offset="6674271">And, in fact, if article 33 is looked at in context, it's in a chapter called Administrative Remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.652" offset="6695273">And article 32 refers to persons within the territory who are entitled to some limited protections from removal and... excuse me, 32 is expulsion, those who were lawfully admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.749" offset="6743652">31 is people who are entitled to a lesser level of protection, and 33 is readily read to simply describe the procedures that can be used to remove those people from the territory and not creating some sort of freestanding obligation to undertake obligations outside the territory, particularly in light of the fact that this would create a mandatory duty of asylum which this Court in Cardoza-Fonseca and in Stevic recognized no one agreed to.</text>

            <text syncTime="2078.559" offset="8454882">The question is: When the attorney general takes the immigration laws out onto the high seas, as he has done here, then do the restraints of the statute travel with him?</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.237" offset="8497618">Now, as the Government points out, the authority that they claim is from 212(f) and 215(a).</text>

            <text syncTime="2106.498" offset="8566686">But they want the power without the restraint that goes along with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.251" offset="8581732">And our point is simply that when U.S. officials, themselves, choose to exercise their authorities, their immigration authorities, on the high seas, they must follow the statute that they invoke as the basis of their authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="2135.482" offset="8682565">Because if, as Justice Stevens has pointed out... uh... the attorney general's discretion were unreviewable, then the attorney general could simply shoot everyone on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.429" offset="8726346">His motive would be irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.749" offset="8735646">If this were in fact the case in the current day, the attorney general could send the Coast Guard out to apprehend fleeing Nazis and deliberately return them to their pre... persecutors.</text>

            <text syncTime="2314.740" offset="9399678">Now, what's Stevic held, and this was also the burden of... of the long footnote in Justice Stevens' opinion in Cardoza-Fonseca is that the... uh... conformance of the United States to article 33 compelled the discretion of the attorney general under the old 243(h) and all that the Refuge Act did in 1980 was to make it mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.624" offset="9491211">What is... is going on here is that lower executive officials, operating pursuant to discretion, supposedly given by an executive order, have rewritten the statute back to the way it was.</text>

            <text syncTime="2554.839" offset="10360044">The class definition was people who have been detained or will be detained on cutters and Guantanamo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.074" offset="10380942">We concede that that was part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.406" offset="10386271">But the second provision was, who are interdicted pursuant to the... the U.S. interdiction program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.360" offset="10410095">At the time there was a lawful program of interdiction and screening.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.774" offset="10427753">Now, there is an illegal program of interdiction without screening.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.376" offset="10438202">Those are different programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.497" offset="10442695">Third, the claim was that were challenging... that the class includes people who were challenging a violation of their procedural rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.072" offset="10468922">Those people who were screened in and found to have credible fears of persecution claimed no challenge or no violation of their procedural rights, because they had benefitted by those procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.839" offset="10508002">So we were not encompassed in the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.241" offset="10513644">Even assuming arguendo that we were encompassed in the class, we were not adequately represented by the people who were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.226" offset="10541543">They were all screened out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.678" offset="10547394">And they were neither adequate nor typical of our class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.942" offset="10564426">And, for that reason, different parties were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.262" offset="10577696">Your Honor, this is similar to... uh... the opinion in the Falcon case, General Telephone v. Falcon, where a conclusion was made that an employee could not adequately represent the class that consisted of both employees or applicants for employment, because they are different groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.615" offset="10647182">Or, to give another example, Martin v. Wilkes, whether the white fire fighters are precluded by the black fire fighters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.409" offset="10678320">Again, here, they are both Haitians, but one group is a group without credible fears of persecution, who are therefore economic migrants, and our class are those who have the most fear of all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.527" offset="10722833">And that's precisely the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.109" offset="10729102">This is not a polite, bloodless process which is going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.683" offset="10747388">Our clients, our named Plaintiff, Mr. Bertrand and Mr. Remy, who my own co-counsel counseled, these people were interdicted on the high seas.</text>

            <text syncTime="2663.351" offset="10794095">They were taken to Guantanamo, where they were held behind barbed wire in U.S. captivity for months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.583" offset="10814993">And then, when they asked for lawyers, before they had an asylum hearing, they were forced back onto the boats and returned to Haiti.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.319" offset="10849997">I am... uh... I will point you out the trial affidavits, on pages 51 to 65 of our joint appendix, at Port-au-Prince, Mr. Bertrand was driven off the boat with fire hoses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.028" offset="10900779">He was fingerprinted, identified by the Haitian military.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.090" offset="10913004">That night he was... uh... taken from his bed, beaten, his left arm was fractured, and he fled into hiding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.996" offset="10940694">And he would now flee again, but for this program.</text>

            <text syncTime="2739.923" offset="11100354">We are not talking about whether 243(h) applies to any random encounter between an alien and a U.S. official outside the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.429" offset="11134418">What we are talking about is a case where the United States, in an unprecedent move, intentionally goes out on the high seas, takes people into their custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.705" offset="11167541">It is the act of taking them into their custody outside the United States that brings them within the control of the attorney general, and it is that act which then, authorizing them to be returned, makes the Coast Guard an agent of the attorney general for the returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.435" offset="11218428">Now, Justice O'Connor raised the question, could they have been referring, when they withdrew the words "within the United States", to excludables as well as deportables.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.092" offset="11257089">The short answer to that, Your Honor, is had they intended merely to reach deportables and excludables, they could have said shall not return any alien physically present in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.558" offset="11298885">If you examine the Government's reply brief, you will see that on page 14 the Government concedes this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.943" offset="11328455">It says,</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.253" offset="11329709">"The essential characteristic shared by those in exclusion and deportation proceedings are both are physically present in the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.938" offset="11356459">In other words, there was no need for Congress to delete the words "within the United States" altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.542" offset="11378820">And there is no valid claim that what was actually going on here is that they... the pen slipped, because at the same time that they deleted the words "within the United States", they added the words</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.811" offset="11427930">"physically present within the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.071" offset="11436916">into 208.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.012" offset="11440677">That was part of the procedure that was going on at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.485" offset="11454575">In short, what happened in 1980 was that Congress was creating three statutory classes of aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.499" offset="11478712">First, aliens within the United States, those lawfully admitted, who are subject to deportation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.843" offset="11504103">Secondly, those physically present in the United States who are either deportable or excludable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.167" offset="11529389">And third, any aliens, those... wherever they are taken a hold of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.921" offset="11552377">And that's precisely the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.812" offset="11559900">Someone becomes a refugee not when they make it to the United States, they become a refugee when they flee the... when they clear their own borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.308" offset="11589889">Then they have escaped their persecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.938" offset="11596472">And the question is not whether we need to let them in, the question is why do we at that point take them back to their persecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.562" offset="11626878">There are many other things we could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.014" offset="11632730">We can interdict and screen them, as was done for 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.886" offset="11644224">We could let them go to third country sites.</text>

            <text syncTime="2934.345" offset="11878072">The statute says you shall not return any alien without screening.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.457" offset="11890506">If... the point of our clients, the 150 who were screened in and then returned, is they would flee again were screening reinstituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.953" offset="11924465">To reinstitute screening, as was done for 10 years under President Reagan and President Bush, would not create a massive inflow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.500" offset="11962709">Last year, over a 9 month period with no serious attempt to restore the democratic government of Haiti, in uncontrolled migration 37,000 people came of whom only something like 10,000 were screened in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.821" offset="12019969">And if you examine the amicus brief of the American Jewish Committee, you will see that 900,000 Cubans have been admitted, that 200,000 Eastern Europeans, that nations many times smaller than ours have shown much more generosity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.799" offset="12075871">And we're not asking that they be admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.730" offset="12083603">All we're asking is that they be given some form of temporary safe haven outside of Haiti, the country that they're fleeing from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.655" offset="12111293">Our amicus briefs by Amnesty International and Americas Watch and the two court rule applying to the district court findings of fact and the Second Circuit's affirmance of that, demonstrate that there's heightened political repression currently occurring in Haiti, and also evidence that specific plaintiffs who have been returned have been abused, were tortured, and are in hiding for fear of their lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.528" offset="12194780">So why return these people directly into the hands of their persecutors?</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.643" offset="12211290">This is tantamount to being accomplices to their persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.704" offset="12227486">And in the same way as the rules against torture and genocide were set up to be universal proscriptions, we cannot see any reason why a country would have no power to send someone back to their persecutors in their own territory where they're most powerful, but then somehow have such power on the high seas where they have no sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.299" offset="12321840">And this also disproves the point about the presumption against extraterritoriality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.033" offset="12340857">This is an international statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.004" offset="12348694">It controls refugee flows in and out of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.146" offset="12361233">It effectuates a treaty, an international treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.379" offset="12374189">It effectuates an international human rights norm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.900" offset="12384325">And most conclusively, our officials have themselves taken these laws extraterritorially, and now that... they argue that this presumption against extraterritoriality should somehow apply to rewrite the statute to add words that were taken out previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.671" offset="12447332">Now, Ms. Mahoney has suggested that what is not required is asylum screening, but the kind of screening that went on before was preasylum screening.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.239" offset="12497592">And you can examine the joint appendix at 378; what was asked was whether they had a credible fear of persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.206" offset="12521520">If you lack such a fear, you could be returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.489" offset="12530611">This was a... a nononerous procedural burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.260" offset="12545762">And the fact that the new policy is effective and has terrified people so that they will not flee is not a reason why it's legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.507" offset="12578676">I'm sure that shooting them would also... or drowning them would also dissuade people from coming, but that is our shame, that is not the reason why it's a legal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.963" offset="12616501">This also rebuts their point about reviewability, for if it is true that the only way that an alien outside the United States can get review of a generally applicable Government policy is through habeas or exclusion then, again, the attorney general could simply order that all Haitians coming on the high seas be shot and that would be unreviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.515" offset="12698735">The Japan whaling case and Cardoza-Fonseca both... both made it absolutely clear that what's going on here is immigration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.090" offset="12725066">It's a construction of an immigration statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.341" offset="12734052">Of course it touches on foreign policy, immigration cases always do, but the Court can construe the statutes in a manner which is consistent with the plain language of the statute, the plain language of the treaty which here is also "return".</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.513" offset="12798731">Return is return is refolai is return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.085" offset="12813046">In other words, you don't take people back, and there should be no doubt as to what's going on here because the executive order that's being invoked says, "you shall not"... that is what is being done is "return".</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.803" offset="12859858">So even if there is some confusion as to what "return" means, that is what the executive order authorizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.967" offset="12884517">The Government repeatedly cites the Knauff case, but the Knauff case had to do with a claim of inherent executive power over immigration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.574" offset="12922970">What is going on here is a power which is purportedly being executed pursuant to statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.946" offset="12948465">And I would note Justice Jackson's powerful dissent in that case, where he said security, like liberty, is dangerous, for many other crimes that are committed in its name.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.074" offset="12996949">This is essentially what's going on here, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.976" offset="13008547">In short, the plain meaning of the statute, the mutually reinforcing plain meaning of the statute and the treaty make it clear that lower executive officials shall not return any aliens to conditions of persecution without regard to their physical location.</text>

            <text syncTime="3327.600" offset="13451061">There's a basic principle in our law that is reflected in Johnson v. Eisentrager, it's reflected in the INA, it's reflected in the construction of 243(h) that governed here for 30 years, that ordinarily an alien's right to protection from a country only arises when they arrive in the territory of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.252" offset="13529637">It is not at all unusual that aliens outside the United States should not have rights under U.S. law or access to its courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.048" offset="13564851">I'd like to emphasize that the removal of the language v. Barber, that that language meant it could not apply in exclusion proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="3370.186" offset="13621380">Then... then why didn't it say so?</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.608" offset="13627126">I mean why didn't it simply refer to exclusion rather than return?</text>

            <text syncTime="3375.989" offset="13644681">The word return, as Judge Walker notes in his dissent, had been used as a reference in statutes before to the manner in which you exclude people from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.727" offset="13683551">If the statute had read deport or exclude to a country where they would be threatened with persecution, it wouldn't make any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.254" offset="13713749">So in order to respond to the concern that... that the INS had that they'd like to go ahead and extend it to exclusion proceedings, they need to add... take out "within the United States" and add another word.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.270" offset="13757739">This was done voluntarily by the INS when the '80 act was being amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.804" offset="13779891">In fact, Stevic and Cardoza-Fonseca say that it is important to look at how the act was being interpreted in the 12-year period after accession to the protocol and prior to the amendment, because we should conclude that what we were doing during that 12-year period was consistent with the protocol.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.066" offset="13848958">And contrary to what Mr. Koh has said, the INS in fact, and the BIA took the position repeatedly that 243(h) had not been extended to exclusion proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.895" offset="13904233">In Matter of Pierre that was settled by the BIA, it still during that period applied only to persons who were within the United States, but we believed that we were in compliance with the protocol and, in fact, we were.</text>
