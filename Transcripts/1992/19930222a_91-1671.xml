            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="138448">We'll hear argument next in number 91-1671, William J. Mertens v. Hewitt Associates.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.308" offset="179617">Mr. Sigman.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="64.744" stopTime="243.775">
            <label>Mr. Alfred H. Sigman</label>
            <text syncTime="64.744" offset="397374">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="67.746" offset="409390">This case presents the Court with the issue of whether a person who knowingly participates in a breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA is liable to restore losses suffered by a retirement plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.193" offset="455157">In 1987, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation imposed a distress termination on the Kaiser Steel retirement plan because of what it described at the time as its gross underfunding.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.550" offset="500610">Petitioners, and all other retirees similarly situated, suffered substantial losses in their retirement income.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.976" offset="526314">Mr. Mertens, for example, suffered a reduction in his monthly benefit from $2,000 to $500.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.437" offset="552123">Petitioners brought this action to recover all losses to the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.641" offset="568946">Petitioners sued the plan's fiduciaries, officials of Kaiser, for allegedly breaching their fiduciary duties to the plan, and also sued the plan's actuary, in a separate action which the district court consolidated, for allegedly knowingly participating in that fiduciary breach.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.922" offset="638118">Essentially, plaintiffs allege that the Kaiser fiduciaries and Hewitt acted together to purposefully underfund the plan by failing to change the plan's actuarial assumptions to reflect Kaiser's decision to essential terminate its steel-making operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.684" offset="701126">As a consequence of that decision, a great number of Kaiser employees were... were forced to take full early retirement benefits, which in turn greatly increased the funding costs to the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.830" offset="745743">Because Kaiser did not fund the plan in a manner to pay for the increased retirements caused by the closing down of its steel operations, the plan became insolvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.459" offset="796211">I'd like to argue three points to the Court today, the first being that under ERISA section 502(a)(3), which provides for all appropriate equitable relief to redress violations of the act, that that statute is broad enough to encompass redress against a person who knowingly participates in a breach of fiduciary duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.882" offset="877922">And that principle also is a fundamental principle of the common law of trusts, which should be incorporated into ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.469" offset="908224">Secondly, I'd like to argue that when Congress in 1989 enacted the so-called OBRA amendment to ERISA, it made... which had explicitly referred to a preexisting underlying cause of action under section 502 for recovery of losses to a plan caused by any person who knowingly participates in a breach of fiduciary duty, that that amendment had confirmed that the right on the part of participants and beneficiaries to sue knowing participants in fiduciary breaches had always existed under section 502.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.702" offset="1045210">Finally, Your Honors, I would like to argue that the liability that we argue for here today is essential in order to further the remedial purposes of the statute, the primary function being to deter fiduciary breaches in the first place, so as to secure the interests of retirees in their pension benefits.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="243.775" offset="1113547">If there were a suit under State law... and I think this question relates on all three of the points you want to bring up, or at least it... it gives me an initial grasp of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.624" offset="1156910">If there were a suit under State law, what would your position be on whether or not there's preemption?</text>

          <turn speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="259.466" stopTime="301.164">
            <label>Mr. Alfred H. Sigman</label>
            <text syncTime="259.466" offset="1176241">Well, in fact we did raise a claim under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.729" offset="1189302">We sued Hewitt for malpractice under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.910" offset="1202050">And after this Court granted certiorari, the district court denied Hewitt's motion to mission on preemption grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.964" offset="1226291">I think that the answer to that question in part's going to depend on the resolution of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.989" offset="1250324">I would point out to the Court, however, that ERISA does provide specifically that plans can be sued and can sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.423" offset="1276133">And there are many instances where district courts have held that malpractice actions against attorneys, against other service providers to plans, are not preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.220" offset="1319287">But, once again, that issue is not presented by this case because Hewitt did not raise it until after the cert petition had been granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="324.010" offset="1434435">And we contend that 502(a)(3) is broad enough, because it is an open-ended provision, to provide relief against Hewitt for aiding and abetting the fiduciaries in that violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="347.883" offset="1529939">Section 404 broadly sets forth the fiduciary standards of ERISA and 409 is the provision of the act which provides for an action against fiduciaries on behalf of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.741" offset="1577377">Congress provided in section 502(a)(3) of ERISA that pension plan participants and beneficiaries could recover, in addition to the remedies explicitly set forth in that section, other appropriate equitable relief to redress ERISA violations.</text>

            <text syncTime="996.847" offset="4125779">The civil penalty was set at 20 percent of the recovery amount, which was defined in the statute as an amount recovered by the Secretary in an action brought by him under section 502(a)(2) or (a)(5).</text>

            <text syncTime="1018.443" offset="4212192">Under OBRA the Secretary may reduce or waive the civil penalty if he finds that its imposition would impair the ability of the fiduciary or, in the language of the statute, the other person, to restore all losses to the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.792" offset="4273527">We believe that that demonstrates that Congress' primary purpose was to assure that losses to the plan would be restored, and not only restored by the breaching fiduciary, but restored also by those who knowingly participate or participated in the breach of fiduciary duty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1131.688" offset="4665155">The question in this case is whether ERISA deprived beneficiaries of their traditional equitable remedies against parties who knowingly participate in a breach of trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.945" offset="4706219">In our view, the answer is found in the text of section 502(a)(3), which authorizes courts to award appropriate equitable relief to redress violations of ERISA and ERISA plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.694" offset="4757210">Although compensatory damages normally are considered legal relief, it is clear in the trust context that equitable relief includes a right to compensatory relief which accordingly should be available under section 502(a)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.861" offset="4809873">That reading of the statute is bolstered by indications from related provisions of the statute, as well as the practical consequences of a contrary reading.</text>

            <text syncTime="1494.091" offset="6114742">It's an action to compel the trustee to redress a breach of trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.475" offset="6132296">This... and if you look at the... the commentary to section 199, it makes clear that the relief was compensatory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.488" offset="6160299">One of the examples, for example, is if the trustee has invested money in a bank that he should have known would fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.393" offset="6179944">The bank fails, the money is no longer there, the trustee is personally obligated to make the trust whole for the loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.896" offset="6205961">In... this case involves a suit where the trustee did not breach the trust by himself, but there is a person who knowingly participated with the trustee in the breach of trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.785" offset="6253504">Now, at common law the understand... before ERISA, the understanding was we can't expect the trustee to sue the person who participated with him in the breach of trust, so we will allow the beneficiary himself to sue to recover the money for the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.702" offset="6305227">And... and that is the action that's at issue here, and that's described in another part of the restatement, in section 326, and it's also referred to in the treatises cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.708" offset="6341276">We think that the statute very clearly was referring to this particular cause of action because section 502(a)(3) uses the word "redress", which is exactly the word that's used in the particular section of the restatement and the natural meaning of the word, if you look in dictionaries, is to compensate or to pay back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.250" offset="6419434">One further point I'd like to make, which I think is one of the key considerations in this case, is the practical consequences of a contrary reading of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.858" offset="6461857">ERISA has its remedies for... civil remedies set forth in section 502(a), which this Court has described as very comprehensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.623" offset="6492890">Except for section 502(a)(3), there is no provision that generally allows a civil action to recover for a breach of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.499" offset="6528417">There are quite a number of important provisions of ERISA for which there is simply no remedy outside of section 502(a)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.374" offset="6555898">We could look at the provision at issue in Ingersoll-Rand, for example, which made it a violation of ERISA to fire an employee to prohibit his pension plan from vesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.739" offset="6589335">If individuals who are harmed by violations of those provisions cannot sue under section 502(a)(3) for compensatory damages, then ERISA has effectively left them without a remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.360" offset="7079810">And we submit that in determining what is appropriate equitable relief to redress the violation, you should look to what relief was available before ERISA was passed under principles of equity, which includes relief against not only the fiduciary, but against a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.467" offset="7132264">The second point, which is very important, is that section 502(l)(1)(a), (l)(1)(b), makes it a violation of ERISA for another person to knowingly participate in a breach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.356" offset="7175836">So at least in this type of situation, the party has violated ERISA because, if nothing else, he's violated section 502(l)(1)(b).</text>

            <text syncTime="1795.879" offset="7321912">And second, unless the 1989 amendment to the statute is read to provide that equitable relief includes money damages, it will be rendered, in essence, a nullity.</text>
