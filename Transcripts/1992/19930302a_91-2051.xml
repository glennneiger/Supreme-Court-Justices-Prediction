            <text syncTime="69.394" offset="422389">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="74.464" offset="442660">In 1944, Congress recognized that there was a need to bring the massive Missouri River under control.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.635" offset="471395">They passed the Flood Control Act at that time which was to authorize the construction of reservoirs and dams and to convert that river to public beneficial uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.360" offset="514235">By 1954, that scheme had resulted in the entry into an agreement between the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and the Government that for a sum certain, all lands, interests, claims, demands, et cetera, in the affected property would be conveyed in fee simple or in fee title to the United States subject, however, to certain conditions, quote, hereinafter set forth, end quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.779" offset="635966">The treaty underlying this dispute is the Treaty of 1868 which, for all intents and purposes, is indistinguishable from the treaty that this Court considered in Montana v. U.S. some 12 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.087" offset="685181">The issue before the Court today is whether, in light of that alienation of land under the act, whether or not the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe somehow retained regulatory authority over nonmembers on what was now and is now public land.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.148" offset="757383">To answer that question--</text>

            <text syncTime="204.349" offset="962183">I should state, as a way of factual background, that there are some 2,800,000 acres in this reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.769" offset="991858">Approximately 1,400,000, or half of the reservation, has been alienated out to non-Indian fee ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.875" offset="1024355">And it's particularly important in this analysis that the Court keep in mind that the strip of take land that was along that western side of the Missouri River and on the eastern edge of the reservation included not only 100,000... 104,000 acres of tribal land, but also 18,000 acres of non-Indian fee land.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="243.224" offset="1117664">Is that a checkerboard situation on the reservation where the holdings of fee land and reservation are kind of like a checkerboard?</text>

          <turn speaker="mark_w_barnett" startTime="258.067" stopTime="300.661">
            <label>Mr. Mark W. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="258.067" offset="1177119">It is interspersed.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.934" offset="1184537">I think it would be accurate to say that the majority of the fee land on the reservation is towards the northwest corner, or away from the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.772" offset="1219855">However, again, as I mentioned, the other portion of fee land that had taken place in this reservation prior to the taking was along that river, some 18,000 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.730" offset="1263741">And so, there's really two areas where fee land had come into being, and then between those, slightly removed from the river and in many places directly along the river, was still fee land.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.388" offset="1310343">So, yes, there was interspersing.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.423" offset="1322464">Since the gates of this dam have closed and the water has arisen, the tribe has not sustained--</text>

            <text syncTime="310.801" offset="1387979">It did originally.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.118" offset="1393308">The courts below have found and the tribe has basically conceded that as to the fee lands not in the take area, that they were no longer claiming jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.657" offset="1431447">However, they had originally in the declaration in '88 that caused us to go to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.894" offset="1456420">The tribe has not sustained, quote, an independent and vigorous scheme of wildlife management on this reservation, and I quote from the Government's brief at page 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.952" offset="1500619">The district court found... and I quote... the tribe, meanwhile, does very little game management.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.423" offset="1522457">End quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.640" offset="1527368">The tribe admitted through its Game, Fish, and Park Director at trial... this is in your joint appendix at 379... that the tribe does not do any management on the Missouri River and does not even have a plan for fishery management.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.734" offset="1591734">And that is at 381.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.055" offset="1617021">The tribe has... for a period of some 30 years, Your Honor, the State of South Dakota has vigorously managed all of this public property and assumed jurisdiction over all of this area, both the take land, whether it was previously Indian land or whether it was previously fee land by non-Indians, as well as all the waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.534" offset="1702911">We have asserted and maintained and exercised jurisdiction and management of that asset, and the tribe has not.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="395.938" offset="1728616">But does that bear because of some statute or some case from this Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="403.478" offset="1758709">I mean, how do you tie that fact into the established law regulating this subject?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_w_barnett" startTime="410.382" stopTime="515.650">
            <label>Mr. Mark W. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="410.382" offset="1786294">I think that it is the most compelling evidence of how all of the parties to this entire transaction have construed the '54 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.523" offset="1830911">The '54 act made it quite clear that all interests, all lands were to be conveyed to the public, to the government, and that is in section I, except for such conditions are set forth in the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.282" offset="1889948">Section II again suggests all interests, not just the land, but the interests, were being conveyed to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.186" offset="1917533">And last, but not least, section X, which was drafted by the tribe itself and adopted by Congress in the form submitted by the tribe, the tribe was... treaty rights were to be limited in the future to access.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.631" offset="1979287">Whereas before, but for the navigational servitude, they might have claimed that they had control under section X, they were reduced to a position of access... and I quote... subject, however, to regulations governing the use by other citizens of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.657" offset="2047414">And so, our position is, Your Honor, that for 30 years, we have read that act to say just what it... to mean just what it says, that the tribe had lost the power to exclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.215" offset="2093703">And I might point out in that contention that the tribe lost the power to exclude that section 4 of the '44 act, which authorized the entire process, specifically said that no use of these areas shall be allowed which is inconsistent with the game and fish laws of the State in which the area is situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.147" offset="2181370">We read that to mean just what it sounds like it says, that the State game laws will be in control in these areas.</text>

            <text syncTime="515.650" offset="2207388">General Barnett, am I correct that you have taken or you have represented to us that the only regulation to which the State has consented in the past, basically by agreement I guess, has been regulation of Indians on the reservation lands, as distinguished from nontribal members?</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark W. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="540.683" offset="2307594">We have conceded and we do concede today that the tribe is in charge of game problems, game management, and so forth even as to nonmembers on tribal trust lands, the lands that they still have the power to exclude from.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.311" offset="2370079">But we have contended that as to those areas, that they cannot exclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.996" offset="2384812">They have lost the power to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.198" offset="2393589">I might add that... and I would suggest that it's in deference to the citizens who are tribal members... we also are not contending today that... or rather, we are conceding that the tribe can regulate that activity of its own members out on this public property.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.677" offset="2471538">We're not even arguing that point, but only that we are regulating the activity of nonmembers on this public property.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.850" offset="2500168">We... I should point out that, just so you... if I may cover briefly what the State has done in the way of exercising that jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.573" offset="2547084">We have what the district court found was a pervasive law enforcement, end quote, presence on all of these public properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.327" offset="2578118">We have initiated a comprehensive and substantial wildlife and fishery management program.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.148" offset="2601419">We've stocked 72 million fish out in this asset, including stocking fish along the area that once was tribal land.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.821" offset="2636110">We've monitored, managed.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.773" offset="2643946">We have an endangered species plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.075" offset="2653142">We have what the Court basically recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.427" offset="2662546">We have developed, and I might add we've developed in partnership with the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.413" offset="2686474">We have developed what is now, in the words of the district court, a nationally recognized fishery with regard to certain game fishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.167" offset="2717507">You might ask... and I think it's a fair question... if the State has exercised jurisdiction for 30 years, and the tribe has not, which is clearly what the district court found, then how did we get to this dispute?</text>
            <text syncTime="656.244" offset="2769752">In 1988, the State attempted to enter into an agreement with the tribe with regard to the taking of deer, not just on the public property and not just on the reservation, but in effect, a joint opportunity for hunters to buy one license, split the revenue between the entities, and allow the hunter to go where the game is without respect to jurisdictional boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.840" offset="2860136">That... those negotiations broke down when the tribe insisted that before nonmembers could hunt on that public property, they would have to have tribal permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.048" offset="2900991">We could not accede to that demand, and so at that time, negotiations broke off.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.452" offset="2922621">And the tribe then publicly announced... and I'll quote the tribe's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.071" offset="2941115">Quote, the tribe announced its intentions to enforce tribal hunting and fishing regulations on the taken area.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.325" offset="2966088">That's at page 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.110" offset="2973298">And the announcement that they used was, quote, all hunters must now hold a tribal hunting license to hunt on any and all lands within the exterior boundaries of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.084" offset="3021155">The State license will no longer be honored.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.536" offset="3034947">End quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.502" offset="3038813">And yet, the tribe comes before you today and suggests that they've had jurisdiction and exercised jurisdiction for all those years.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.058" offset="3069011">And I would submit to this Court that if they have, why did they need to go with a public announcement suggesting that now you must have a tribal license to hunt on these public lands?</text>

            <text syncTime="1337.201" offset="5493592">And I would submit to you that that is an excessively broad reading of footnote 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.521" offset="5518879">I think that their case hinges upon their understanding of footnote 9, which talked about the Allotment Act intent of disestablishing these reservations, and that that intent was opposite to the concept of exclusivity and regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.250" offset="5585857">I would submit, however... and I would... in fact, I would quote the final sentence in footnote 9 in the Montana case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.404" offset="5614382">But what is relevant in this case is the effect of the land alienation occasioned by that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.659" offset="5643431">In other words, what the Court was saying is that whatever the intent of the Allotment Act, or in this case under the Cheyenne River Act to open it up to the public, whatever the intent, the effect is what's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.050" offset="5693063">Even though the Indian Reorganization Act repudiated the intent of the Allotment Act, nonetheless, the effect was still the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.240" offset="5725768">This land had gone out of the Indian domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.775" offset="5739875">They had lost the power to exclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.227" offset="5749697">And so, our contention is that just the same under the '54 act, not to mention navigational servitudes, under the '54 act, they lost that power to exclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.016" offset="5792851">And so it is, as the district court said, indistinguishable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2661.595" offset="10791225">Everywhere else in the Cheyenne River Act where the Congress used the phrase tribal council, it refers to the tribal council as a governing body.</text>

            <text syncTime="2676.870" offset="10852247">If we are to read it, as this Court advised last week in McGonsett v. Samuels, so that every word and clause of the statute has meaning, then tribal council must mean something more than the mere right to hunt and fish because every member of the tribal council enjoyed that already by virtue of the general reference to a reservation of powers to hunt and fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.649" offset="10923404">In light of that, the one place in the legislative history that addresses the right to jurisdiction actually occurred in a colloquy between the tribe's representative and Representative Berry, the sponsor of the legislation, the day after the conversation that General Barnett referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.307" offset="10974082">And in that instance, the tribe said that it read section X, which was now before it and was adopted in that forum, to reserve to the tribe the power to hunt and fish and to regulate the taking of hunting and fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.966" offset="11028626">He said specifically no white person can go on this land without a license to hunt and fish.</text>

            <text syncTime="2845.697" offset="11527564">Contrary to what the State of South Dakota has told you, the district court found... and these findings are at joint appendix, page 65... that the tribe has always asserted jurisdiction over this taken area both before it was taken and since 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.207" offset="11581690">It has never acquiesced in State jurisdiction, and that the jurisdictional matrix which has, in fact, ensued is that the tribe enforces its tribal fishing and hunting regulations against all, including nonmembers, on the taken land; whereas the State of South Dakota has limited its enforcement to nonmembers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.966" offset="11640727">Those are the findings of the district court and they are not disturbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.168" offset="11653475">In... moreover, if I can get back to... strictly with respect to the grazing, it gave the grazing, which is the most important aspect of this land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.059" offset="11701017">Because it is done pursuant to the tribal grazing code, the district court found that it gives the tribal land a distinct Indian flavor because it is criss-crossed by fences setting up these areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.681" offset="11739574">That code is enforced by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and in fact, the entire area has a pervasive Federal presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.501" offset="11770817">The tribal regulation is subject to oversight by the Corps of Engineers, but not by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.722" offset="11791715">The enforcement of tribal regulations in accord with Tribal Ordinance No. 3 have always included the availability of Federal enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.495" offset="11818777">All tribal fishing and hunting regulations and ordinances are initially approved by the Secretary of the Interior.</text>

            <text syncTime="2941.841" offset="11912191">There are about 104,000 acres of land here that were taken in 1954 by the Federal Government that formerly had been trust lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.364" offset="11942284">What happened, when the land was taken, was the land continued in... title continued in the United States as it had been held before, but whereas before it was held for the beneficial use of the Indians, after 1954, the bundle of sticks was divided up a little bit differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.290" offset="12001948">After 1954, the Federal Government got title to that land and got all the uses of the land that were essential for its purposes of flood control and irrigation and for the secondary purposes for which the Corps of Engineers runs these projects.</text>
