            <text syncTime="54.801" offset="353653">Although it was fully cognizant of the decisions in Gray and Connolly, Concrete Pipe and Products asked for hearing because it believes the assessment of withdrawal liability under the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendment Act is unconstitutional when applied to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.929" offset="422198">Concrete Pipe and Products requests the Court rule that the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendment Act is unconstitutional under the substantive due process and takings provisions of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.420" offset="472145">It also asks the Court rule that the presumptions that are set forth in 29 U.S.C. 1401 deprive CP&amp;P of the guaranteed right to procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.747" offset="525434">The facts which distinguish Concrete Pipe and Products from Gray and Connolly are the lack of connection between Concrete Pipe and Products and those who will benefit, the imposition of liability without responsibility, the imposition of liability without regard to the employee's expectations, the fact that the act uses an irrational formula of increasing liability on the basis of the amount of contribution, and the retroactivity involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.634" offset="656987">With respect to the first fact, the lack of relationship between Concrete Pipe and Products and those who will benefit, it should be noted that this act would require Concrete Pipe and Products to use its funds for the generalized benefit and needs of members of society who have never had any relationship with CP&amp;P.</text>

I think what we are pursuing in this action is that the Government has been recognized to be limited in its ability to deal with us, and the Government's ability to deal with us is that it can't charge one member of society for debts with which it is unrelated, and there must be some reasonable relationship in the legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="499.209" offset="2131338">As a matter of fact, it was interesting that in the Connolly argument Mr. Felner, arguing on behalf of the PBGC, indicated that it required the employer to pay for consequences of its own conduct, and when he was asked by one of the members of the court, what if it was not the fault of the employer, and he specifically stated that's not before us, and the takings clause involves transfers of the property between unrelated parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="1767.832" offset="7205780">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.934" offset="7218215">There are two... the issues before the Court today fall into two groupings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.105" offset="7242874">One is the extent to which the statute imposes upon Concrete Pipe and Products a biased decisionmaker in the form of the trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.931" offset="7298254">The other issues before the Court really all group into whether the product which Concrete Pipe and Products purchased was what it thought it purchased.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.107" offset="7350917">Whether the statute constitutes a taking, whether it constitutes a denial of substantive due process, or whether the actuarial presumption is unconstitutional, depends on the nature of these kinds of plans, and these plans are not as Concrete Pipe and Products represents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.942" offset="7466274">The Connolly v. PBGC and Gray cases validated the statutory scheme that the Laborers Pension Trust operates under.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.434" offset="7524265">The original premise of that pension trust was that employees... employers would begin contributing today, they would grant pensions for employees who had years of service prior to the existence of that plan, in this case all the way back to 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.900" offset="7618097">That was made possible by acts of Congress as it went forward, and Congress had experience with the failures of those plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.607" offset="7656863">It enacted ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.774" offset="7661565">Prior to ERISA, this plan agreed with... the employers and the union agreed that the risk of loss would be on the participants in the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.748" offset="7713496">If there were inadequate funds to pay, then those who thought they had pensions would not have pensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.604" offset="7740873">Congress saw fit to change that in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.473" offset="7756337">It adopted the original title IV which had a 30 percent net worth risk on the contributing employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.662" offset="7793118">That's 30 percent net worth on the employer defined as the control group, not defined as Concrete Pipe and Products, a subsidiary in Shafta, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.219" offset="7835331">It would be the entire company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.086" offset="7842855">There is the... when Concrete Pipe and Products came on board in 1976, after ERISA was in place, in 1980, the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act did alter the nature of its liability from a contingent risk of 30 percent of its control group assets to what Concrete Pipe and Products estimates is a 50 percent liability for that subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.191" offset="7967302">There's no evidence that it is more than 30 percent of the control group.</text>

            <text syncTime="2049.514" offset="8332494">--Well, that is not in the record, as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.918" offset="8350153">What is estimated is that the liability of Concrete Pipe and Products exceeds 30 percent of the subsidiary net worth, not necessarily the parent company which is the... which wholly owns that subsidiary, so they have not shown on an as-applied basis that there is even that differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.916" offset="8438133">Secondarily, the other misperception is that the plan which they purchased did not have benefits that would warrant that kind of adjustment of economic cost by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.527" offset="8508559">These kinds of plans, the change that Congress wrought upon the industry was to say from here forward not only do you have to... you, the employers, have to pay in sufficient contributions to provide pensions for those who are already vested, already retired, who'd worked from 1937 on, you're going to have to speed up the funding that future employers would otherwise have paid to provide retirement for your employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.366" offset="8643978">So beginning in 1974, a compression began to take place in the industry where employers had to fund the past contributions and they had to fund the contributions, the service credits that were being earned currently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.976" offset="8710434">That is reflected in the table that is reproduced in our brief that shows that today, or that as of 1982, the employers who remained in the plan were paying $3 an hour for funding of previously promised benefits and the projected cost of the current hour that was worked was merely 55 cents, or thereabouts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.395" offset="8824118">Now, those employees who earned... such as Concrete Pipe and Products who earned a contribution that was worth 55... that would cost 55 cents today to pay it in the future have an expectation, and Concrete Pipe has an expectation, that when those employees actually retire, they won't be receiving whatever the dollar... unit dollar amount is for the monthly credit that they're paid today... in the record it shows $43.12 a month per year of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.770" offset="8973539">Rather, as the years go by and contributions render it possible and inflation occurs, trustees have the discretion to make further changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.114" offset="9030904">That was the attraction to a plan like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.066" offset="9042711">It is not a plan that is a percentage of your final year's salary, it is a plan where the monthly credit is specifically defined on a year-by-year basis and it increases over time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.374" offset="9099971">Concrete Pipe and Products says there's no relationship to us; we got no benefit from this plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.562" offset="9128706">That is not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.864" offset="9137901">They have not seen fit to adduce evidence as to the value of the benefits that their employees earned, how many of their employees are retired, how many of their employees are vested, what the actuarial cost of those employees may be on the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.726" offset="9209372">The actuarial cost of the service that they contributed for may well exceed not only the $100,000 that they paid in in contributions, it may also exceed the $200,000 that they're being charged on withdrawal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.319" offset="9271753">On an as-applied basis, it's simply not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.156" offset="9295158">The actuarial presumptions are a part of this package that an employer purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.245" offset="9327446">The actuary that made the withdrawal liability calculation is the actuary that was the actuary for the plan in the year that Concrete Pipe and Products became a contributing employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.672" offset="9389199">Part of the package that they acquired was that actuary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.640" offset="9405082">The actuarial assumptions about which they complained today are the actuarial assumptions that that actuary was using when they began, and the methods that that actuary was using, when they began contributing and when they left contributing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.335" offset="9467776">The record shows that the changes in actuarial assumptions that were applied to Concrete Pipe and Products by the actuary as a matter of withdrawal were actually more generous than the assumptions that were strictly being used by the actuary for the plan, because they gave credit for higher interest rates being earned on assets on hand reflective of PBGC's single employer termination rates, and they only retained the 6 percent actuarial investment return assumption for the unfunded portion of the plan and even as to that, they excluded from that the assumption that that 6 percent would cover the expenses of operating the plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2410.085" offset="9774871">It doesn't seem to me to be very persuasive to say that indeed, the interest rate he applied later was even a little better for them than the interest rate he applied earlier.</text>

            <text syncTime="2450.961" offset="9938293">It is the same methodology from the day that they began to present, and when withdrawal liability became a factor and an employer left, the contention is not that the actuarial assumptions are wrong for an on-going plan, the contention is that a withdrawing employer is being unconstitutionally impaired by being unable to challenge the actuary's assumptions, and what I'm suggesting is that those assumptions, the only assumptions that are different from a withdrawing employer than an employer who purchased the plan are the five assumptions that are set forth in the record, and those are generally more favorable to the withdrawing employer than they are for the ongoing employers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3052.300" offset="12343648">In effect, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.787" offset="12365591">Arguably, we would think that the actuarial presumption is also not before the Court here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.792" offset="12393699">While the arbitrator did in fact recite the existence of that presumption in reaching his decision, it seems pretty clear in analyzing what he did in that opinion, is that he weighed the evidence and the other testimony that was presented to him and concluded on that basis alone that the plan's assumptions were reasonable, but the thing that seems clear to us is that in any event these actuaries who do plan assumptions are in no way either biased or adjudicators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.443" offset="12508220">I mean, they're not doing an adjudicative function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.662" offset="12517101">This isn't a case-specific kind of task that they perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.132" offset="12534969">Rather, they are required by law to set these assumptions in advance of the withdrawal of any employer to whom they will apply, and then they have to be applied across the board for the period that they're in existence uniformly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.440" offset="12592229">And contrary to the company's attempt here to impugn some purported bias of the trustees to the actuary, in fact the Congress made it plain that the assumptions have to be the actuary's best estimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.418" offset="12656177">If they're not, they're unreasonable as a matter of law and the arbitrators and courts have so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.889" offset="12686061">And moreover, these actuaries have all kinds of rules they have to follow, and if they don't do that, their licenses can be suspended or even revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.363" offset="12731932">I think it's important to note that the scheme that Mr. Murphy suggests here would simply be unworkable in terms of how this situation might work.</text>

            <text syncTime="3189.773" offset="12893578">The scheme that Mr. Murphy is suggesting be used with respect to these assumptions simply wouldn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.629" offset="12925029">This is a very technical and complicated process, the establishment of actuarial assumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.616" offset="12948958">There's a good reason that Congress assigned this task to actuaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.585" offset="12968811">It had first done so in 1974 as a part of its enactment of ERISA, where the assumptions were to be set by the actuary for purposes of funding all kinds of defined benefit pension plans, and after 6 years of experience in using the actuaries in that fashion, it again assigned this task to them in 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.148" offset="13047074">The... there is a range of reasonableness, that's true, but it's not by no means as broad a range as Mr. Murphy would suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.789" offset="13089601">What the actuary has to do... and there's many assumptions here, not just the interest rate assumption to be examined, but what the actuary has to do is really consider what liabilities are going to have to be paid by this particular plan over 30, 40, 50, maybe even 60 years into the future, as the various participants retire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.553" offset="13180716">Also in a plan like this one that was very seriously underfunded, the actuary can't simply pick an interest rate that may reflect what the current day's investment returns are going to be, because he knows that there's going to be money coming into the plan to make up for that underfunding over all of that many years into the future, and that he has to be very conservative about what the rate of return might be able to be 40 years down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.758" offset="13301506">If there wasn't some presumption of reasonableness afforded these actuarial assumptions, what we would be talking about is a situation where the employer could make the plan have to come in and prove every element of these complicated determinations in every single case, and it would completely defeat Congress' purpose in trying to limit the amount of unnecessary litigation in these withdrawal liability collection actions to let the plans do the matter expeditiously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.979" offset="13434417">Turning, then, briefly to petitioner's other constitutional challenges today, in response to a question you raised earlier, Justice O'Connor, it was clear in ERISA in 1974 when ERISA was enacted what a defined benefit plan was and what a defined contribution plan was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.892" offset="13518009">Congress plainly provided that a defined contribution plan was a plan that provided an individual account for each employee and that a defined benefit plan was any other plan... that is, any plan that didn't provide an individual account for individual employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.687" offset="13585196">Contrary to Mr. Murphy's contention here this morning, it was never conceded, certainly by PBGC, that this plan was anything other than a defined benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.476" offset="13628350">The same disclaimer clause that's quoted in the briefs that was in the plan in 1976 and thereafter, also noted that the plan was paying premiums to PBGC's insurance program, which of course it had to do only as a defined benefit plan, but under protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.706" offset="13705359">I believe it was Justice Scalia who noted that yes, there were a couple of erroneous district court decisions early on, but the law was clear, and we believe that Concrete has to be charged with notice of what the law was and what the plan was it was joining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.184" offset="13783204">We would simply suggest that the substantive due process and takings challenges in this case are both governed by and resolved by the Court's prior decision in Connolly and Gray, and I thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3435.283" offset="13875573">Your Honor, the SDA presumptions, the... page 54 of the appendix clearly shows that the trustees made a determination that the withdrawal occurred in 1981 and the issue was whether the plant was mothballed or permanently closed, and that was a determination that the trustees made and it was challenged throughout the entire proceedings and the presumptions... there is no disclaimer that the presumptions were not issued in their favor and clearly the arbitrator was aware of the presumptions because he cited the presumptions at page 400 and 401 of the joint appendix in issuing his second decision, so it was a decision of fact, it was raised, it is before the Court, and it needs to be determined whether the trustee's decision on the A presumption is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.238" offset="14107436">With respect to the statement that Concrete Pipe is on notice of the actuaries in 1976, there was no multiemployer Pension Plan Amendment Act even at the time they closed their plant, and there was no presumptive formula to apply it to at that time, so there was... obviously to say that at the time they entered the plan they were fully aware of all the unfunded liability calculations is not accurate.</text>
