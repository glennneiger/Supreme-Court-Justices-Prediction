            <text syncTime="39.899" offset="292912">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="41.601" offset="299704">This case concerns Ricky Raley's 1986 conviction as a persistent felony offender under Kentucky law.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.077" offset="333663">That conviction was based on two prior guilty plea convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.019" offset="353412">On the 1981 conviction the record was a plea negotiation form.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.795" offset="380474">Raley filed a pretrial motion to suppress the evidence of those two prior convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.680" offset="400014">At the suppression hearing Raley acknowledged that the plea, 1981 plea was recommitted by counsel and that he was guilty of the offenses to which he pleaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.476" offset="439198">The Sixth Circuit ordered a new hearing regarding that plea and resulting persistent felony offender conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.251" offset="466260">The attorney general of the Commonwealth of Kentucky respectfully contends that because a challenge to a prior conviction offered for purposes of sentencing enhancement is a collateral attack the convicted defendant should bear the burden of proof to demonstrate the invalidity of the prior conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.404" offset="538881">The Kentucky Supreme Court has ruled that the validity of a prior conviction under the persistent felony offender law is not an element of the offense, and that ruling should be binding on the Federal court under this Court's opinion in Martin v. Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.815" offset="608576">Further, the ruling of the Kentucky Supreme Court is fully consistent with the analysis employed by this Court in Lewis v. United States under the Federal convicted felony possession of firearm law.</text>

            <text syncTime="133.454" offset="667090">Well, Mr. Sonego, the Kentucky Supreme Court allows a defendant to make some sort of challenge to the validity of a prior conviction under this statute, doesn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="146.193" offset="718081">It must be by a pretrial motion and it's a hearing conducted outside the presence of the jury and decided by the judge as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.449" offset="747129">But it's also clear, of course, that the Kentucky Supreme Court believes it is compelled to do so under the opinions of this Court in allowing such a challenge.</text>

            <text syncTime="164.585" offset="791642">So you don't think it was just interpreting Kentucky's, the Kentucky recidivous statute when it said that you can make that sort of challenge?</text>

            <label>Mr. Ian G. Sonego</label>
            <text syncTime="175.033" offset="833438">No, Your Honor, the Commonwealth contends that the Kentucky Supreme Court was viewing itself compelled by decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.910" offset="876905">We have cited the case of Commonwealth v. Gadd where the court discusses the fact that the prior, the validity of the prior conviction is not an element of the offense itself and believes itself compelled to allow a pretrial challenge in order to comport with due process rulings by this Court.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="206.533" offset="959452">So the Commonwealth wants something more favorable to it from this Court than they've got even from the Supreme Court of Kentucky, say nothing of the Sixth Circuit?</text>

            <text syncTime="221.834" offset="1020683">Your Honor, the Commonwealth would be happy with a more favorable ruling, but this Court could reverse on more narrower grounds simply by putting the burden of proof on the convicted defendant to show--</text>

            <text syncTime="238.447" offset="1087139">That's the primary issue that this Court must resolve today in this case and--</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="245.121" offset="1113784">I wonder if there isn't even a more narrow ground than that, because is it not true that the proceeding that we're involved in is a collateral attack on the 1987 conviction?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ian_g_sonego" startTime="254.498" stopTime="263.545">
            <label>Mr. Ian G. Sonego</label>
            <text syncTime="254.498" offset="1151296">--It was a habeas corpus proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.581" offset="1171671">Yes, Your Honor, it was a habeas corpus proceeding against the persistent felony offender.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="263.545" offset="1187449">So the question in this case is whether the procedure followed in Kentucky satisfies due process sufficiently to defeat a collateral attack on the 1987 conviction, isn't that correct?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ian_g_sonego" startTime="273.592" stopTime="314.319">

            <text syncTime="275.632" offset="1235828">It is actually a double-header collateral attack, if you'll pardon my use of that analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.564" offset="1255576">We have a habeas corpus attack on the persistent felony offender conviction which in turn was based on the 1981 conviction subsumed within the persistent felony offender conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.564" offset="1303537">And I would point out to the Court also that according to Raley's habeas corpus petition filed in this case he was still serving time on the 1981 conviction when he filed that habeas petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.531" offset="1351394">So clearly he was not attacking the 1981 conviction itself, but only insofar as it resulted in a persistent felony offender conviction.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="314.319" offset="1390577">In fact I'm not sure it is even a collateral attack on the '81 conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.742" offset="1408236">It's the contention that in the '87 proceedings it's fundamentally unfair to use the 1981 conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.925" offset="1433000">They wouldn't have to set aside the '81 conviction in order to say that was fundamentally unfair one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.551" offset="1455465">In other words I really think you have only got one collateral attack, and that's this proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="334.764" offset="1472393">Well, Your Honor, I would be, I would have to agree with you that there should only be one collateral attack, but clearly you are correct in saying that this collateral attack was brought because of the persistent felony offender conviction, not because of the 1981 conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.290" offset="1558492">It would appear since Mr. Raley did not attack the 1981 conviction he was satisfied with the result in that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="567.808" offset="2404546">Well, under the hypothesis we're assuming that the guilty plea was uninformed, it was a completely uninformed waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.655" offset="2451880">Why is that any different from a case where there's no counsel?</text>

            <text syncTime="585.409" offset="2474972">Your Honor, I think the difference is the court has assumed that where counsel is not provided it is more likely an innocent man would plead guilty than otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.327" offset="2522620">Where counsel has been provided then counsel has the opportunity to point out to the defendant his rights and possible defenses that may exist, the opportunity to discuss the evidence that might be introduced against him, and the possible sentences that may result.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.742" offset="2600256">The Commonwealth respectfully contends that placing the burden of proof on a convicted defendant making a collateral attack for purposes of sentencing enhancement is consistent with this Court's ruling in Medina v. California, where the Court ruled that the state could require the defendant to demonstrate he was incompetent to stand trial, and that case was also based on Martin v. Ohio.</text>

            <text syncTime="660.308" offset="2774545">Your Honor, the history of the precedents of the Court have directed that the denial of counsel is a fundamental right permitting a collateral attack on a guilty plea, and have also indicated that an involuntary guilty plea may be collaterally attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.077" offset="2897634">I don't believe the Court has indicated any other basis for a collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.732" offset="2924278">The Court's precedents, such as United States v. Timmreck, direct attention to fundamental defects in the proceeding that would make the resulting conviction fundamentally unfair and potentially or probably result in an innocent person being convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.883" offset="2992824">And certainly probable innocence is an important factor, as this Court has made clear in evaluating the circumstances of a collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.700" offset="3032112">The history of the precedents of this Court clearly indicate that on a collateral attack the convicted defendant must bear the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.939" offset="3089059">That has been clear at least since Johnson v. Zerbst in 1938 and this Court has repeatedly reiterated that the burden for a collateral attack should fall on the convicted defendant who mounts such an attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.339" offset="3150708">Most recently in Hill v. Lockhart the Court placed the burden of proof on the convicted defendant to establish ineffective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.427" offset="3191041">This was consistent with the Court's earlier ruling in Strickland v. Washington regarding counsel provided for a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.111" offset="3221761">The Court has also made it clear that a collateral attack is not a substitute for an appeal and therefore a higher standard must be applied in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.008" offset="3261363">Within the context of sentencing enhancement it really is a double collateral attack that is being mounted in the proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="818.044" offset="3405454">Yes, Your Honor, that could shift the burden of proof to the prosecution, bearing in mind this Court said in Marshall v. Lonberger that the defendant must convince the trial court of the credibility of his testimony, or whatever witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.934" offset="3465013">But I certainly, if I were prosecuting the case, would want to present whatever evidence I had at that point and not take a chance on the judge deciding the defendant was a credible witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.772" offset="3508376">But certainly, as this Court has indicated most recently I guess in the dissenting opinion in Marshall, in Loper v. Beto, defendant's own testimony certainly opens serious credibility questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1454.645" offset="5951870">And that, by the way, brings the Tucker and Burgett line of cases into line with the traditional basis for providing relief from final judgments of the conviction, i.e. that it was rendered by a court that didn't have competent jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3013.951" offset="12189075">It seems to me that a collateral attack consists of anything that seeks to deprive a prior judgment of its normal effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.636" offset="12231812">It doesn't have to dissolve the prior judgment entirely, but anything that seeks to deprive it of what would be its normal effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.083" offset="12261591">So if in a later suit, for example, you seek to deny res judicata effect to an earlier decision that's considered a collateral attack on the earlier decision, if you say it was a wrong decision, therefore it shouldn't be res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.094" offset="12317702">That's a collateral attack, and that's what you're seeking to do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.905" offset="12332958">You're seeking to say that this conviction, which would normally have the effect of rendering you liable to a higher penalty the next time you're convicted, in this case should not have that effect because it was not a valid judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.994" offset="12385307">Why isn't that properly called a collateral attack on the judgment?</text>

            <text syncTime="3098.180" offset="12526055">That may be true and your analogy may be correct, but it is very distinguishable from a habeas proceeding, and that's what I'm... the point is that on the habeas proceeding the defendant may be greatly limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.290" offset="12594496">But here it is not a habeas proceeding, it's the correct procedure to use in the lower court level when they're proving a persistent felony offender.</text>

            <text syncTime="3125.635" offset="12635874">The petitioner would have the State of Kentucky allow the presumption of regularity of the prior convictions to overcome its presumption against the waiver of the constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.109" offset="12713718">We submit that the presumption against the waiver of the constitutional right, as this Court has recognized in the waiver of counsel cases, is a much greater presumption than the interest of having a presumption of regularity for the prior convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.761" offset="12792399">It was also discussed the burden of proof that would take place in the hearing if the Sixth Circuit has remanded it back to the State of Kentucky, and what is the proper burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.710" offset="12848092">Because this Court has said in the right to counsel cases that those convictions are presumptively invalid, we believe that the burden of proof here should be at least a clear and convincing burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.060" offset="12909532">They have asserted that the burden of proof should be by a preponderance of the evidence and cited Johnson v. Zerbst, but Johnson v. Zerbst was entered long before the right to counsel cases have come into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.082" offset="12973585">And the right to counsel cases would support at least a clear and convincing standard of proof in placing the burden upon the Commonwealth to prove that the conviction is constitutionally valid.</text>
