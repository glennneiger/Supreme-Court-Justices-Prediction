            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="144618">We'll hear argument next in Number 91-1600, the Hazen Paper Company v. Walter F. Biggins.</text>

            <text syncTime="39.666" offset="303234">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="44.551" offset="322773">The petitioners have asked this Court to review and set aside a fundamentally flawed decision of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.396" offset="354120">The First Circuit in this case misapplied the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act first by upholding a jury finding of age discrimination not on the basis of any demonstrated bias or prejudice against Mr. Biggins relating to his age, but instead on the theory that the Hazens discharged Mr. Biggins from their employ in order to interfere with his vesting in the company pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.931" offset="448265">The court of appeals then compounded this error by reinstating previously vacated liquidated or double damages based on an improper application of the knew or showed reckless disregard test for willfulness approved by this Court in TWA v. Thurston.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.192" offset="509287">The pertinent facts of this case can be recited very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.983" offset="524543">In 1977, the Hazens hired Mr. Biggins, then age 52, to serve as the company's technical director.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.279" offset="553696">The Biggins held this position, as well as a seat on the company's executive committee, for approximately 9-1/2 years, at which point a dispute arose between the parties concerning Mr. Biggins' involvement in certain consulting activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.927" offset="608239">At that point, the Hazens discovered that unbeknownst to them, Mr. Biggins had been marketing the services of a company he had founded and named for himself to competitors of Hazen Paper Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.854" offset="655991">Accordingly, the Hazens required Mr. Biggins to sign a confidentiality and noncompetition agreement as a condition of continuing employment at the company in order to protect Hazen Paper from what the Hazens saw as a conflict of interest.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="141.922" offset="712207">Mr. Gordon, does the record show the total number of employees at the Hazen Paper Company?</text>

            <text syncTime="147.278" offset="733627">I don't believe it does, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.488" offset="742509">Mr. Biggins, by his own trial testimony, acknowledged that he had no problem with either the substance of the tendered agreement, or, indeed, with the Hazens' reasons for insisting that he sign such an agreement, yet Mr. Biggins refused to sign the agreement unless his annual compensation at the company were more than doubled and increased to $100,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.543" offset="830698">The Hazens refused, the parties reached an impasse, and Mr. Biggins employment was terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.647" offset="855149">That's all that happened in the case, and none of it had anything to do with Mr. Biggins' age.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.782" offset="875733">Yet by reason of the timing of the termination, Mr. Biggins failed to reach the 10 years of service required to vest in the company's pension plan, and it was this fact... Mr. Biggins' pension loss... that the First Circuit relied upon most explicitly as the central basis for upholding age discrimination liability.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert B. Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="203.986" offset="960474">Its holding, Justice White, was very clear: that the evidence permitted an inference that the Hazens intended to defeat Mr. Biggins' pension vesting, and that there was a relationship between Mr. Biggins' pension status and his age that rendered such pension interference age discrimination within the purview of the ADEA.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.290" offset="1057754">At trial, Justice Blackmun, Mr. Biggins first testified that he thought it was a matter of hours, without specifically saying how long he had to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.127" offset="1089101">On cross-examination, he was asked if it were not true that vesting was 8 months away, and he acknowledged that he had been told that.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.512" offset="1122642">The record goes no further on the point, and it stands in precisely that conflict, that it could be as low as a matter of hours, or as long as 8 months.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.619" offset="1219087">Now, turning first to the issue of underlying liability, the First Circuit's very explicit reliance on pension interference as a basis for sustaining ADEA liability was erroneous for each of three independently sufficient reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.748" offset="1271540">Reason number 1, it is the petitioner's position, first and foremost, that judicial substitution of any factor that is not age for age under the ADEA is inconsistent with the language and legislative history of the statute and is simply wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="575.718" offset="2447469">There could, and in fact under title VII, because adverse impact liability has been applied in that arena, there arguably is.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.233" offset="2473487">But the same principles that we are submitting have also been recognized by this Court under title VII as in Gilbert, and in Espinoza v. Farrah Manufacturing Company, where Justice Marshall, writing for the Court, found that it was not discrimination on the basis of national origin to refuse to hire non-United States citizens, notwithstanding a logical correlation between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.387" offset="2554153">It's thus our first point that judicial substitution of any factor... here it was pension interference, but it would apply to other factors... for age is not allowed by the statute at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.514" offset="2602636">Barring a showing of adverse impact in the manner contemplated by Griggs v. Duke Power, this would require reversal of the First Circuit's decision here, which rested not on legitimate inferences of age bias, but instead on pension interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.494" offset="2662509">Reason two: even if this Court were, in certain situations such as those suggested by Justice Stevens, prepared to endorse the proposition that a trier of fact applying the ADEA may substitute surrogates for age when there is a factual relationship for the surrogate and age, the case at bar would not satisfy the condition precedent for such a substitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.262" offset="2769611">Here, the First Circuit simply presumed that there was a factual relationship between Mr. Biggins age and his pension status.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.886" offset="2800122">The court of appeals reasoned that Mr. Biggins' age and pension status were, to borrow the Court's phrase, inextricably intertwined, and that if it were not for Mr. Biggins' age... 62... he would not have been within a hairbreadth of vesting in the Hazen Paper pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.857" offset="2856024">As the Solicitor General has conceded, however, and as the undisputed facts bear out, the First Circuit's reasoning on this point is completely without force.</text>

McLean Credit Union, pension interference may not ever, as a matter of law, provide the predicate for an inference of age animus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.977" offset="4708523">In Patterson, this Court held that when construing a civil rights statute, it is inappropriate to construe an earlier statute broadly and beyond the reach of its text in order to cover conduct that is clearly and in terms covered by a later enacted statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.865" offset="4767978">Recall that in Patterson, this Court refused to extend the reach of section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which simply barred discrimination in the making or enforcement of contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.254" offset="4817611">It refused to extend the reach of that statute to cover on-the-job racial harassment when Congress had later, and in clear terms, covered such conduct under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of '64.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.561" offset="4858780">The Court's holding rested both on prudential principles of statutory construction, which we submit are applicable here, and further on a desire to avoid circumvention of the detailed enforcement mechanisms provided for by Congress in the later statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.419" offset="4914264">Here, precisely as in Patterson, the existence of a clear statutory remedy under ERISA section 510, a later-enacted statute with its own independent enforcement mechanism militates very strongly against stretching the coverage of the ADEA beyond its text to provide a duplicative legal remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.390" offset="4982078">Turning next to the issue of liquidated damages, I would begin by pointing out that under the law a necessary precondition to an award of liquidated damages is a legitimate and sustainable finding of underlying age discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.759" offset="5039651">Should this Court conclude, as the petitioners have urged, that there is no proper basis for sustaining ADEA liability at all here, then the First Circuit's reinstatement of liquidated damages must be struck automatically, and this Court would not need to reach the question of what the appropriate standard for awarding such damages ought be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.363" offset="5118019">However, even if predicate liability could on some theory which has yet to be articulated by any party be sustained, petitioners submit that under no rational application of the statutory standard of willful can the jury's finding of willfulness be upheld, and the district court's decision to vacate liquidated damages should accordingly be reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.698" offset="5211328">The ADEA provides in section 7(b) that liquidated or double damages shall only be awarded in cases of willful violations of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.374" offset="5246019">This Court has stated numerous times and in numerous different contexts that willful is a term of varying meanings and must be construed according to its context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.880" offset="5288128">Now, in Trans World Airlines v. Thurston, the Court held that in the context of the ADEA, Congress used the term willful in order to provide a form of punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.879" offset="5332118">The Court in Thurston found that by deliberately providing for liquidated damages only in cases of willful violations of the statute, borrowing that standard from the Fair Labor Standards Act's provision for criminal penalties, Congress meant to create a two-tiered scheme for ADEA liability, with liquidated damages specifically reserved for those most especially blameworthy and reprehensible violations of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.237" offset="5453536">Petitioners... in reaching this result, the Court in Thurston specifically rejected interpretations of the term, willful, that would, in the words of the Court, result in an award of liquidated damages in all or virtually all cases where underlying liability were found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.309" offset="5525842">Petitioners most respectfully submit that the time has come for this Court to modify the knew or showed reckless disregard test for willfulness it approved in Thurston.</text>

            <text syncTime="1449.197" offset="5941398">Had Congress intended that result, it would have done precisely what it did in the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.831" offset="5963864">It would have authorized an award of liquidated damages as a matter of course for every violation of the statute subject only to a narrow exception where the employer can demonstrate good faith as Congress provided for in the Portal to Portal Act Amendments, but by doing the precise opposite... specifically borrowing the statutory standard from the criminal penalties provision... Congress created the diametrically opposed presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.947" offset="6060308">Numerous courts that have confronted this question have recognized that when applied by its terms, Thurston's new or showed reckless disregard test essentially reads the term, willful, out of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.675" offset="6115269">These courts are properly recognizing that in a statute such as the ADEA, where a specific intent is part and parcel of the underlying violation itself, that a standard of punitive damages activated merely by a requirement that such violation have been nonnegligent, is in reality no standard at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.860" offset="6196040">It is for this very reason that a majority of the circuits, as we've cited in our brief, are departing from Thurston's definition of willfulness and imposing a heightened standard for liquidated damages which properly resembles the common-law test for punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.890" offset="6260092">These courts, by modifying Thurston in this way, giving life to the common-law sense of punitive damages, are properly serving Congress' intent to preserve two discrete tiers of ADEA liability with liquidated damages reserved only for the most reprehensible violations of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.470" offset="6330414">Accordingly, we are asking the Court to use this case as an occasion to refine the definition of willfulness approved in Thurston and return liquidated damages to their punitive moorings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.210" offset="6381405">A violation of the ADEA should only be deemed willful if the employer's age discrimination is especially reprehensible, and in this respect we have alerted the Court to a series of considerations which at common law reflect how that determination ought be made by a jury... namely, whether the employer showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct violated the ADEA, whether the employer's actions were repeated, were without colorable justification, were otherwise unusually harsh, egregious, or outrageous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.120" offset="6509091">These are well-established standards for common-law punitive damages, as this Court's decision in Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Haslip reflects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.556" offset="6542842">Justice Blackmun's majority opinion as well as Justice O'Connor's concurrence reflect that these are standards that the Court is comfortable with insofar as punitive damages standards are concerned, and they should be the ones which inform the meaning of willfulness under the ADEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.957" offset="6608357">When this standard is applied to the facts of this case, it is absolutely clear, we submit, that the jury's finding of willfulness cannot stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.200" offset="6637405">There was no evidence that the Hazens engaged in a pattern of discriminatory conduct, that there was prior evidence of repeated discrimination, that they singled Mr. Biggins out for unusually harsh or oppressive treatment relating to his age, nor was there evidence that the Hazens' actions were utterly without colorable justification, a term this Court has used in interpreting willful in its decisions in Murdock and Spies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.147" offset="6733118">The most the evidence showed here was that the Hazens confronted an employee who was marketing services to competitors and demanded that he signed a confidentiality agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.562" offset="6766763">Given Mr. Biggins sensitive position at the company and having a seat on its executive committee, this cannot be construed as discriminatory at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1838.825" offset="7499864">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, respondent submits that the First Circuit correctly adopted this Court's previously determined definition of willfulness in Thurston and properly considered the evidence concerning Mr. Biggins' pension status, and I wish to first address why the Thurston definition has been properly applied by the First Circuit in this case, and then, secondly, why the pension issue as presented does not actually appear in the facts of this case, and that, even if it did, pension interference would be proper evidence of age discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.279" offset="7653673">With respect to willfulness, the petitioners are effectively asking this Court to reverse this Court's definition of willfulness set down in TWA v. Thurston and in McLaughlin v. Richland Shoe under the FSLA, the definition that was adopted here by the First Circuit which is currently adhered to by a majority of the circuits in all cases, including those of disparate treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.595" offset="7754923">That definition as shown by Thurston is consistent with the statute's plain meaning, it's consistent with the legislative history, and it's consistent with the use of that term in other statutes in Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.163" offset="7809258">The objection that is raised that presumably this creates automatic double damages is simply not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.820" offset="7839874">The employer, most importantly, always has the opportunity to convince the jury that it was acting in a good faith attempt to comply with the law, something which there was no evidence of here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.838" offset="7895880">In addition to that, the employer has a host of other defenses which may justify actions that may still be underlying violations such as a legitimate belief on the employer's part that there was a BFOQ, or that he was exempt from the act, so it's simply not true that this is a situation of automatic double damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.753" offset="7975606">But where, as here, the employer engages in an intentional and purposeful scheme to discriminate against someone on the basis of their age, there's no reason to believe that Congress sought to shield that employer from what is a very limited additional remedy, in this case of doubling the back pay award that the plaintiff would otherwise be entitled to.</text>

            <text syncTime="2039.468" offset="8302450">However, the two-tier structure means there's also a two-tier inquiry, and the standard for the second tier of inquiry can't be determined by the standard for the first tier, and there's simply no reason to believe that just because there is a two-tier structure, that that somehow tells us how many cases Congress wanted to have fall into which category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.860" offset="8391998">What I submit that we should do is simply follow the language that Congress used, follow what that term has been held to mean before, and let the parties argue to the jury... it's a factual question... as to whether or not they had a legitimate reason for believing what they were doing was or was not legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.003" offset="8464618">With respect to the alternative that the petitioners propose, it is one of, or similar to one of a real hodgepodge of conflicting and inconsistent alternatives that various circuits have suggested, but what the petitioners are suggesting is purely result-oriented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.976" offset="8540478">It is not an attempt to interpret the words of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.589" offset="8554897">It is simply an attempt to, as they put themselves, put a gloss on the statute, which is another way of saying, rewrite it, in order to achieve a particular result in this case, and it creates what is effectively a different meaning for one term in the same statute, in the same place in the same statute, the depending upon what type of plaintiff there is or perhaps how many plaintiffs there is, something that there is simply no principle of statutory construction that would justify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.712" offset="8695436">It also leads to extremely subjective and contradictory results.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.916" offset="8712259">In fact, the lower courts cannot even agree as to whether or not to apply this to disparate impact versus disparate treatment cases or whether it applies to cases supposedly involving policies as opposed to just individual age animus, and in fact that's a distinction that is probably useless, since any policy could just as easily apply to a single individual as well as to a group of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.952" offset="8812360">And the petitioner's standard adds additional requirements, requiring repeated actions, or without colorable justification, that no court, anywhere, has ever suggested, and which certainly isn't suggested by the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.843" offset="8879965">And one of the reasons why all of the lower courts cannot agree on what an alternative standard would be, and one of the reasons why the petitioners themselves have their own standard and in fact there seem to be as many standards as there are defendants, is simply because they are not looking to the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.682" offset="8943286">There's no real reference point; it's purely result-oriented, looking to minimize the number of cases in which this would appear.</text>

            <text syncTime="3617.362" offset="14614051">They obtained further counsel from their attorneys, and they knew that they were discriminating, but they thought in good faith that their action constituted an exemption from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.712" offset="14667446">So there's a whole panoply of opportunities for an employer to show that despite underlying age discrimination conduct he should be exempt from the liquidated damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.011" offset="14716660">I think that's an important factor, and I think as this Court observed yesterday in the Roland v.
