            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="44.826" offset="313194">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="48.184" offset="326569">This case involves a due process challenge to a Federal statute, section 801 of the HUD Reform Act, which revises the process for adjusting rents in the section 8 program.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.773" offset="376933">Section 8 provides federally subsidized housing for low-income tenants.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.036" offset="397936">The Ninth Circuit held that the statute abrogates contract rights between section 8 project owners and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.218" offset="442762">The Court of Appeals therefore concluded that the statute is unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.810" offset="473064">In our view, that holding is wrong for three reasons:</text>
            <text syncTime="89.245" offset="490827">First, the contract right on which the owners base their challenge to section 801, the right to be free of individual comparability studies when rents are adjusted, is not guaranteed by the contracts in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.957" offset="557701">As a result, the contract claim that forms the basis for the Due Process attack does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.001" offset="585808">Second, even if the owners had the contract right that they claim, section 801 does not constitute a substantial impairment of that right within the meaning of this Court's cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.559" offset="636068">And finally, even assuming that the impairment is substantial enough to warrant further inquiry, section 801 satisfies the Due Process Clause because Congress acted rationally and permissibly in reforming the rent adjustment process in the section 8 program both to reinstate the program's market rent premise and to impose uniform national standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.642" offset="736378">Now, the starting point in this case is the assistance contracts that the project owners enter into with HUD or with the local intermediaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.904" offset="773472">Respondents' claim is that they have a contract right to automatic annual rent adjustments each year based on a published HUD formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.776" offset="816940">They deny that under the contracts HUD can apply a cap to that adjustment based on the results of what has been called a comparability study, which is akin to an appraisal or a survey of local comparable rents at projects that do not receive Federal assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.189" offset="894576">In our view, the language of the contracts is dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.281" offset="910981">It appears on pages 4 and 5 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.826" offset="925191">Section 9 of the contract first provides for adjustments based on a published factor determined by HUD, but the contract goes on to provide what is called an overall limitation, and that limitation states:</text>
            <text syncTime="214.398" offset="991438">"Notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract, adjustments as provided in this section shall not result in material differences between the rents charged for assisted and comparable, unassisted units as determined by the Government. "</text>
            <text syncTime="232.438" offset="1063640">Now, based on that provision, HUD conducted its comparability studies... surveys of market rents at comparable properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.340" offset="1099167">When HUD concluded that the adjustments that would be produced under the factor technique would produce rents that materially differed from those charged at the comparable units, it used the comparability studies as a cap.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.631" offset="1156323">In our view, the contract clearly authorizes this.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.865" offset="1173250">The entire--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="261.396" offset="1179415">Well, Mr. Dreeben, now, was the decision of the Ninth Circuit basically that that provision should be read as requiring the Government to factor in those differences in the published formula?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="277.905" stopTime="304.519">

            <text syncTime="277.905" offset="1245452">--That's correct, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.639" offset="1252349">The Ninth Circuit interpreted this overall limitation as a subordinate guideline for HUD to use in composing the factors, and in our view, that interpretation is wrong for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.712" offset="1300728">First, it's not justified by the plain language of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.241" offset="1318804">The contract simply does not say that HUD must use this overall limitation as a methodology for composing the factors.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="304.519" offset="1351928">Well, read in light of the statute, could it be thought to be ambiguous to some extent as to whether they're going to make these comparability studies in the published formula or whether they're going to do it separately in a case-by-case basis?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="322.121" stopTime="330.773">
            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="322.121" offset="1422354">The statute itself, in our view, is not ambiguous on the question of whether comparability studies are authorized.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="330.773" stopTime="346.127">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="330.773" offset="1456940">No, I said was the contract ambiguous, read in light of the statute, which contemplated, apparently, that the Government could agree in these contracts to a formula approach to the adjustments?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="346.127" stopTime="526.444">
            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="346.127" offset="1518380">No, I do not think that the contract is at all ambiguous read in light of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.688" offset="1536561">The contract is, if anything, far clearer on this point than the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.326" offset="1555160">The contract explicitly uses the words,</text>
            <text syncTime="357.652" offset="1564460">"notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract. "</text>
            <text syncTime="361.480" offset="1579715">as a way of indicating that when there is a collision or a conflict between the provision dealing with published adjustment factors and the substantive standard that was animating this program... namely, that rents shall not exceed market-level rents... that the overall limitation provision takes precedence, and the words that are used there are crystal-clear on that point, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.407" offset="1683474">If there is any doubt about what the statute actually meant about it... and I will concede that the statute is not as precise as the contracts... the statute is entrusted to HUD to administer, and HUD, exercising the authority that any administrative agency has in this situation, has promulgated a regulation that is entitled, "Overall Limitation", and that sets forth that the comparability rule that is parallel to the statute and is parallel to the contracts is an overall limitation, and the agency has interpreted its authority under that rule as authorizing comparability studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.642" offset="1828401">Now, the owners in this case have made much of the fact that HUD did not in the very earliest years of the program conduct comparability studies, but I think that claim really pales against the historical background here.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.292" offset="1883049">The program was enacted in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.058" offset="1894021">The first published adjustment factor wasn't published until 1976, and when that factor was published, HUD recognized that there could be some problems with the factors, and those problems arose because they cover extremely wide areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.631" offset="1952326">Exact, precise, reliable market data is not available for every market locality in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.706" offset="1976672">HUD had to rely on information that they got from the Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and it used that information as a means of devising what it believed would be generally accurate factors, but it recognized that the factors might need to be improved.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.449" offset="2039679">Two years later, in 1978, an internal HUD task force report noted that it is HUD's policy that field offices may adjust rents up or down based on the results of an individualized comparability study, and by 1981, HUD had found out that there were sufficient problems in certain areas that required the use of comparability studies in order to ensure that what Congress intended came to pass, namely, that the owners got annual rent adjustments that enabled them to keep pace with the movement of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.623" offset="2168306">But in no situation were those adjustments designed to produce rents that were materially in excess of what comparable projects were experiencing in the area, with the one proviso that to the extent that there was any such initial difference when the contract rents were set, it would be preserved.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="526.444" stopTime="534.207">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="526.444" offset="2239568">Well now, why did the Government concede in the Ninth Circuit that section 801 substantially impaired the contract?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="534.207" stopTime="679.085">
            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="534.207" offset="2270706">Well, Justice O'Connor, I don't believe that the Government did concede that in any meaningful sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.627" offset="2292336">We did not specifically raise a substantial impairment argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.423" offset="2303516">We argued that the owners have no contract right to formula-based adjustments without the use of a comparability cap.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.810" offset="2333087">We're arguing that here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.732" offset="2340714">In the alternative, we argued in the Ninth Circuit that even if there was an impairment of that contract right... in other words, if the Ninth Circuit had been correct in its Rainier VIew decision... that still didn't constitute a due process violation, and we gave many reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.600" offset="2400274">We also, in the lower courts, addressed an alternative takings analysis that had been proffered by the respondents, and many of the elements involved in that analysis run parallel to the claim we make today, which is that even if the Court were to disagree with us on the contract and find, contrary to our view, in the clear language of the contract that there was a contract right, as the Ninth Circuit saw it, even, still, the Federal statute at issue here doesn't constitute a substantial impairment of that contract right because the statute also preserves the same financial standard that was always in this program... namely, comparable market rents.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.428" offset="2555546">It is respondents' burden, who are attacking the constitutionality of a Federal statute, to satisfy this Court that they have met every element of the test that the Due Process Clause requires, and in our view they have not met the burden of showing substantial impairment.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.546" offset="2620016">Now, the Ninth Circuit gave one other reason on the contract that I want to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.669" offset="2644466">The Ninth Circuit concluded that if HUD's reading of the contract were accepted, the election by HUD of the use of a formula would be nullified.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.211" offset="2690651">That holding does not follow from either the language of the contract or the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.536" offset="2715937">HUD continued throughout this program to use the formula as the primary mechanism for adjusting rents.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.987" offset="2741746">It published the formulas every year, it applied them to the projects, but what it did do was to apply the overall limitation as written.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.328" offset="2775183">Namely, if there was a conflict between the comparability determinations and the formula, then the comparability determination took precedence to the extent of the conflict, and that is not a nullification of the formula, it simply is a qualification on any adjustment that's available to an owner.</text>

            <text syncTime="684.038" offset="2869955">That's exactly right, Chief Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.427" offset="2875598">The comparability survey is the last step of the process, and I think what makes it most clear that this is an independent requirement of the contract is that the contract itself provides two different mechanisms for adjusting rents each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.782" offset="2932963">First, it provides the factor method which we've been discussing.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.280" offset="2950935">Second, the contract provides for special adjustments that any owner can seek when he can show that operating costs at his project and similar projects, or at his project alone, have increased more rapidly than is taken into account by the general factor, and when that happens, he can apply for a specialized increase based on his project alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.084" offset="3038184">If HUD agrees, he gets that increase, subject again to this cap.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.973" offset="3057723">The cap applies overall.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.425" offset="3063575">It comes at the end of the section dealing with the rent adjustments, and it governs both of the prior mechanisms for adjusting rent that the contract and the statute set forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="760.930" offset="3177573">I think you're right, Justice Scalia, that if HUD really manipulated the adjustment factor in such a way so that it was never applicable, then this would be a very different case.</text>

            <text syncTime="770.066" offset="3214145">And Congress has required in the statute that there be the adjustment formula, right?</text>

            <text syncTime="775.688" offset="3236610">Yes, that's... it required that there be either the use of comparisons of fair market rentals or a reasonable formula, and HUD elected the reasonable formula approach, but the point here is that the factors in general operation are not inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.323" offset="3299095">The problem arises because the best information that HUD could get during this period covered broad areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.321" offset="3327098">For example, there was one factor that governs the entire Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area, which includes Montgomery County, Fairfax County, it includes a variety of areas in which economic conditions are quite different from each other, and the factor may as an overall matter be working just fine for most of the projects that are located in that region.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.189" offset="3410586">But for particular projects, it might be quite out of line, and it was to deal with that particularized problem that HUD adopted the comparability survey technique, it was not as a method of circumventing or abandoning the factors as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.775" offset="3468891">The Ninth Circuit seemed to read it that way, but the record really doesn't support any such claim, and there really has never been a claim in this case that HUD on a wholesale basis disavowed factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.411" offset="3519464">It continues to publish them, and it's attempting to perfect them all the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="862.998" offset="3585815">But again, I don't think that the respondents have ever claimed that at any point HUD ceased to publish the factors.</text>

            <text syncTime="879.820" offset="3653106">Now, in the alternative, and only if this Court concludes, contrary to the language of the contract, that the Ninth Circuit is somehow correct and what HUD was required to do was not apply the comparability survey directly but to work it into the factors, or to revise the factors in response to a comparability survey, then our alternative submission is that section 801 of the HUD Reform Act does not substantially impair the rights that the respondents had under their contracts.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="930.706" offset="3856652">Justice Kennedy, to my knowledge the Ninth Circuit was the only Federal court, the only court to rule on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.796" offset="3889044">There have since the passage of section 801 been three other courts... the Court of Federal Claims and two district courts... that have analyzed the constitutionality of section 801, and all three of those courts found that, as we submit, the owners never had a contract-based right to adjustment-formula increases free from comparability caps, and they therefore terminated the constitutional analysis at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.050" offset="4006073">When Congress confronted the situation, Rainier View was the only Federal court to have ever held that comparability caps could not be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.828" offset="4045152">The district court in that very case had agreed with HUD that comparability caps could be used, but had held that HUD hadn't implemented them properly, there hadn't been national standards... all of those were administrative law claims which the district court conceptualized under the guise of the Due Process Clause, but the basic thrust was, HUD hadn't done it right.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.913" offset="4125505">The Ninth Circuit, on the basis of its reading of the contract language against the background of the statute, announced for the first time that no, HUD, you may not use comparability studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.908" offset="4169495">Where that left HUD was in an anomalous position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.767" offset="4184855">HUD had not, over the years, changed adjustment factors to respond to imbalances that it discovered when it did comparability studies, and under the Ninth Circuit's ruling, the owners were in a position to claim the full adjustment factor increase for each year, the full measure of it, with no comparability constraint, because HUD had misunderstood the way that comparability had to be used, at least as the Ninth Circuit saw it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.551" offset="4288091">So Congress confronted a situation in which a program that had always been designed to keep rents in line with the market, subject to these adjustment procedures, now had projects in it that could claim the benefit of adjustments that would put it far in excess of the market, and these adjustments would amount to windfalls in the truest sense, because they resulted only because the agency had misunderstood what its financial obligations were under the contracts when it readjusted rents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.789" offset="4408986">Faced with that situation, and faced with the fact that the Rainier View decision was on the books, this Court had denied certiorari, the program had to function effectively as a Nationwide program, and it was now subject to disparate standards, Congress enacted section 801 as a mechanism to restore the basis for adjusting rents going forward and to try to rectify the problems it had identified going backward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.373" offset="4515356">Now, retroactively, what Congress did was to raise the rents of the section 8 project owners who had been limited by comparability studies or who had not actually requested rental adjustments because they feared that they would get negative adjustments through comparability studies, and HUD said that as to... Congress said that as to those owners, the full factor shall be applied to increase their rents, but only to the portion of the rents not used for debt services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.408" offset="4627474">So Congress determined to adjust their rents upward to the extent that those rents were affected by operating cost increases, but not to the extent that they were used to cover debt service, which of course hadn't gone up during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.481" offset="4675748">They may well have gone down, since refinancing is an option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.106" offset="4690272">Congress also provided a floor of 30 percent of the full factor adjustment to make sure that no project owner was really left with just a nominal supplementary payment, and again, Congress did that as a means of rectifying what it perceived as well-founded criticisms of the comparability process, yet at the same time, Congress was unwilling to sanction a full windfall adjustment factor as the owners saw it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.563" offset="4796120">Simultaneously, Congress decided to reform the program going forward on a prospective basis by requiring HUD to do, in essence, as the first level response to rent problems, rent adjustment problems, to do what the Ninth Circuit said... adjust the factors if you can, construct a modified adjustment factor based on a smaller market area than the large, original going-in adjustment factor, and use comparability studies to achieve that result, and that surely is not an impairment of the contract right even as respondents claim it, because that's what the Ninth Circuit said HUD was supposed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.063" offset="4950138">Only if that fails, and HUD determines that it cannot construct a modified adjustment factor, or even if it does so, the adjustment factor that it constructs fails to achieve the goal of comparability, HUD is then authorized to use another means of employing comparability studies to get to its ultimate objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.650" offset="5028401">At most, in our view, that is a tinkering with the process and procedure that does not constitute a substantial impairment, because it leaves the owners' financial rights intact and it changes only the way that a comparability study can be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.254" offset="5098827">HUD always had the right to conduct a comparability study.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.019" offset="5109903">The Ninth Circuit never disagreed with that, so there's no additional procedural burden put upon the owners by having to be involved in a comparability study.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.655" offset="5140414">The only question is whether HUD can properly use that study as a second-level response in order to make sure that the factors are achieving the goal of comparability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.042" offset="5182001">The final issue in this case arises only if the Court were to find that there is a contract right and a substantial impairment of that right, and that is the question of whether, notwithstanding those two findings, both of which we would disagree with, the impairment is sufficiently substantial to warrant its invalidation under the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.171" offset="5286491">This Court has not, since the 1930's, invalidated a Federal law on the ground that it had impaired contract rights between the Government and a private party under the Due Process Clause, and we submit that this is not an occasion on which that very strong medicine is warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.773" offset="5364963">The section 8 program is, at its base, designed to use public funds in order to provide low-income housing through the mechanism of private owners providing the housing and receiving subsidies from HUD.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.439" offset="5419611">Two features of this program are critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.438" offset="5435598">The first is that owners are to get rent adjustments each year in order to accommodate changes in the market, and the second feature is that the system was never designed to give the owners above-market rents that would reward them for in effect not being as efficient as the private sector in providing the housing, again subject to the condition that initial differences in the setting of the rents would not be abolished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.536" offset="5543954">Now, the Ninth Circuit's ruling upset the statutory scheme in two distinct ways, and we've discuss them both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.097" offset="5570181">The first is that it made it impossible to have a Nationwide, uniform system for adjusting rents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.328" offset="5595154">Neither Congress nor HUD was willing to acquiesce in what it believed was a wrong decision and bad public policy, and therefore neither Congress nor HUD wanted to extend the Rainier View approach to the entire Nation, so you had a result of a Nationwide system that was no longer functioning under uniform, sound criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.116" offset="5670282">And the second feature of the legal terrain that Congress objected to was that, even where factor-based increases could not achieve the goal that Congress had set for them... namely, providing fair, reasonable increases each year that were not in excess of comparable rents... HUD would have been required to grant such increases, and those results were simply unacceptable in the context of a social welfare program that had the purpose of providing subsidized housing for low-income tenants, not to give windfalls to their landlords, and section 801 responded to the situation to put the program back on track.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.131" offset="5834331">It restored uniformity to the program's operation, and as we've discussed it did that in large measure by accepting the owners' complaints about the way in which comparability studies were conducted, and it required HUD to put out regulations that would rectify prior deficiencies, and it also reinstated and made applicable retroactively the market rent premise of the program so that owners would not be the beneficiaries of HUD's mistake... HUD's failure to recalibrate the factors to the local submarkets in light of comparability, a mistake that would not have been appreciated before the Ninth Circuit's ruling, and HUD did not appreciate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.256" offset="5994827">In our view, those purposes are legitimate and substantial and, in light of the relatively modest impairments that could be said to occur in this case, the rent adjustment mechanisms of section 801 do not infringe the Due Process owners' rights and the constitutionality of section 801 should be upheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="1499.054" offset="6130037">No, Justice Scalia, we don't, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.334" offset="6139128">First, that the case... the United States v. Seckinger, from which that test is drawn, requires that the alternative readings both be reasonable and practicable as well as finding the existence of an ambiguity in the contract, and in our view it would not be a reasonable and practicable alternative to require HUD to adjust the adjustment factors in light of comparability studies if in fact adequate data does not exist to allow HUD to do that, and the result would be the contradiction of the statutory mandate of comparability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.478" offset="6259709">So first of all, we don't think that the bare bones of that particular canon are satisfied, even assuming ambiguity, which we disagree with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.867" offset="6289279">The second reason is that this is not simply a naked commercial contract in which the Government went out to purchase widgets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.082" offset="6318119">It is a contract that's enacted against the background of a regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.253" offset="6334837">In large measure, the contracts parallel the statutory language, the statutes have been implemented through regulations, the owners knew that this was a program administered by an administrative agency, and in the comparable case of United States v. Fulton, this Court gave deference first to the agency's construction of the statute, and then it applied the same meaning to identical language that was incorporated into a contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1704.706" offset="6952685">One of those promises, and the reason why we are here today, was a written promise of annual rent adjustments based on factors published annually in the Federal Register together with the basis for those factors, so that all you had to do was look in the Federal Register, you got your factor, if it was 5 percent you multiplied that by last year's rents, and there you were for the coming year.</text>

            <text syncTime="3071.847" offset="12421263">The City of Fulton, however, is not applicable for two or three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.657" offset="12440489">Number 1, it seems, Your Honor, that the contract did nothing more than mirror that statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3089.637" offset="12492421">It has a choice in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.728" offset="12500780">Number 2, in Fulton, they said that there was no other evidence of what the parties' intent was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.460" offset="12523663">Here there is other evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.132" offset="12530350">We haveaffidavits, we have their position, we have the regulations on the thing, and thirdly, Your Honor, you'd have to ask what... deference to what?</text>

            <text syncTime="3166.637" offset="12800352">They... in '81 they made some other changes to the thing that really cut... they made it a limited dividend program, for instance, and they... then they did start to also furnish some mortgages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.664" offset="12840476">It becomes a tax shelter program which was not the program that it started out to be and not the program under which this contract was drafted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.160" offset="12870465">Well, as long as I still have a couple of minutes here, I will go on with the... on the constitutional side, they asked on... was there a substantial impairment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.154" offset="12926471">That is a mixed question of law and fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.795" offset="12940995">That's something that's determined at the trial level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.826" offset="12949146">We put in affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.341" offset="12955206">If they had some complaints about that, if they had some objection to that, they should have objected at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.150" offset="12978403">We could have had a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.338" offset="12983209">For instance, in the U.S. Trust v. New Jersey, they had an extensive trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.491" offset="13003794">You build a record as to whether or not it is substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.395" offset="13023438">We claim it's substantial because it was not only a material inducement, it was a critical inducement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.143" offset="13046426">That seems to be the rule under Worthen v. Kavanaugh, under the El Paso-Simmons case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.750" offset="13068786">How substantial is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.813" offset="13077041">I don't think the Government could contest the fact that these owners would simply not have entered into this contract without this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.339" offset="13115180">Finally, on purpose, we think that whatever the level of scrutiny, we think it should be careful, at least, because the Government is here dealing with its own contracts, but on... even on a rational basis analysis, the Government cannot do this simply to save money, and that is basically their only reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.191" offset="13190621">The only other reason they now give is uniformity, which is a euphemism for saying that we want to be able to break our contract with everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.109" offset="13222282">If there are no further questions, I thank this Court very much.</text>
