            <text syncTime="9.296" offset="118920">Well, this case comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.369" offset="139295">It does not lend itself easily to announcement from the Bench and perhaps it suffices to say that it concerns the income tax deductibility of an item called "paid subscribers" that a newspaper publisher acquired in the acquisition of another news organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.075" offset="222051">The Internal Revenue Services regarded this asset as indistinguishable from goodwill and disallowed any deduction for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.479" offset="259668">When suit was instituted in the District in New Jersey, however, judgment was given for the taxpayer petitioner and the Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.053" offset="310032">It held that even though the asset may have a limited useful life that can be ascertain with reasonable accuracy, its value was not distinguishable from goodwill.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.442" offset="367501">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse that judgment and hold that this particular taxpayer may depreciate the item in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.946" offset="409610">We conclude that this taxpayer has successfully borne its very substantial burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.614" offset="436255">Justice Souter has filed a dissenting opinion and has joined therein by the Chief Justice and by Justices White and Scalia.</text>
