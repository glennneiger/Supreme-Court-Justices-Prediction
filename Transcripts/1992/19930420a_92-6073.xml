            <text syncTime="35.125" offset="273942">The issue in this case is whether the Eighth Amendment and specifically the Excessive Fines Clause applies to the concept of... applies to the civil forfeiture under 21 U.S.C., section 881(a)(4) and (a)(7).</text>
            <text syncTime="49.545" offset="331621">Mr. Richard Lyle Austin is the owner of the Garretson Body Shop and also the 1972 mobile home that were seized by the Government under the... these appropriate statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.235" offset="382403">The facts of the case show that he transferred 2 grams of cocaine to someone in the body shop, and that he obtained this from the mobile home.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.699" offset="416257">A subsequent search of the mobile home and body shop indicated there were small amounts of cocaine, some paraphernalia, and some small amounts of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.006" offset="449485">Mr. Austin pled guilty in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.598" offset="459830">He was sentenced to 7 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.078" offset="465786">The Government seized his mobile home and his body shop, which was his livelihood, and he had been in the auto body shop for about 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.074" offset="501730">The affidavit in the record indicates he intended to return to that job, that type of living, the body-shop living, when he got out of prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.059" offset="533704">The district court granted summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.461" offset="547288">The court of appeals reluctantly affirmed indicating that the technical legal distinctions regarding in personam and in rem prohibited it from reaching the issue of the Eighth Amendment applicability.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.258" offset="594517">It also indicated that clear court decisions by this Court and other courts do not require proportionality in the civil proceedings for the forfeiture of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.564" offset="631715">I want to make three points in this oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.428" offset="647180">First is that where the Government stands to gain monetarily the Excessive Fines Clause should apply and Eighth Amendment proportionality should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.033" offset="681557">Secondly, the in rem fiction shouldn't bar the application of the excessive fines/proportionality analysis when the civil forfeitures are quasi-criminal or punishment in actual character.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.312" offset="730667">Thirdly, under this Court's decisions in Halper and Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, those tests actually show that this civil forfeiture is punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.719" offset="776329">First of all, regarding the first point, the Court's decision in Browning v. Ferris provides a basis for applying the Eighth Amendment Excessive Fines Clause to civil actions and to forfeitures.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.633" offset="851980">You indicated that you rejected the application to actions between private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.574" offset="875804">You left open the possibility that when the Government is involved, that the Excessive Fines Clause could also be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.330" offset="906732">And, in fact, you suggested in, I think, a footnote quoting Halper that it might give rise to the Eighth Amendment analysis when the Government stood to gain punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.416" offset="947170">And in Justice O'Connor's concurring and dissenting opinion, there was a substantial analysis of the historical development of the Excessive Fines Clause and the fact that fines and forfeitures are equivalent, and that, in fact, the Eighth Amendment should apply to civil actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.970" offset="1025328">Your quote in Browning v. Ferris regarding the court of Vermont also indicated... the Supreme Court of Vermont also indicated that in certain circumstances you felt that the Excessive Fines Clause or the Eighth Amendment could be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.919" offset="1089172">In your case Harmelin v. Michigan, Justice Scalia's footnote also indicated that it makes sense to scrutinize governmental action more closely when the state stands to benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.309" offset="1142670">It's clear that under 21 U.S.C. 881(a)(4) and (a)(7), the Government has stood to benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.704" offset="1176316">We cite in our brief an article from Newsweek which indicates that since 1985 the Government has obtained about $2.6 billion through this forfeiture proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.472" offset="1223337">There's also a quote by the Director of the Asset Forfeiture Branch of the Attorney General's Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.948" offset="1253221">It says that civil forfeiture is the goose that laid the golden egg.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.028" offset="1265550">There's another quote also that we indicate from a American Criminal Law Review article in which it indicates that in August of 1990, the U.S. Attorney General warned U.S. attorneys that the Department was far short of its projected $470 million in forfeiture deposits and urged them to increase the efforts in order to make the budget goal during fiscal year 1990.</text>

            <text syncTime="1874.860" offset="7632845">Both Halper and the case of Bell v. Wolfish, which is cited, do what is in essence an as-applied challenge to a specific Government conduct; that is a claim that even though a statute is civil in the usual case, as applied in the case, it should be considered forbidden punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.589" offset="7751859">But in the type of as-applied challenge, both Halper and Bell concentrated on the seventh Mendoza-Martinez factor, which is whether the Government conduct seems excessive in relation to the nonpunitive purpose as being claimed for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.485" offset="7839421">The theory of both cases, which was a theory that won in Halper and lost in Bell v. Wolfish, was that if the Government exaction in the specific case is so patently out of kilter with the stated nonpunitive purpose, then the court may safely infer that the true purpose was something else, i.e., the desire to use the sanction in the specific case, not to further the purpose of the statute, but to inflict what is, in essence, punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.409" offset="7991141">Halper makes very clear that the road to that level of... lack of rationality is very long and there are very few cases in which the specific invocation of--</text>

            <text syncTime="2569.394" offset="10411020">That was a case in which a ship had been wrecked on the coast of Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.808" offset="10432649">The goods were taken to the coast, and the Government brought a forfeiture action claiming that shortly after the ship was shipwrecked, the goods had been found in Delaware without tax stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.489" offset="10491372">The Government lost that case, Chief Justice Marshall saying what seemed to be a statement of the common law of forfeiture, that a forfeiture wouldn't lie at common law in a case where there was nothing that the person, on whom the forfeiture would work, could have done to keep it from happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.851" offset="10580816">And we would take that as being part of the common law of forfeiture.</text>

            <text syncTime="3288.755" offset="13288460">That very likely could be the case, but again, that's a... it's a... an analysis that has to be determined I think by the court in the first instance, by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.140" offset="13322001">In other words, all the factors have to be taken into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.341" offset="13330778">The third factor is whether it comes into play on a finding of scienter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.104" offset="13353870">In this case, the statutes themselves indicate that scienter is a factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.619" offset="13379888">In other words, if the owner does not know of the drug use, then it's a defense.</text>
