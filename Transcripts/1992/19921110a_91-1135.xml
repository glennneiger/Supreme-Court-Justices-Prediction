            <text syncTime="24.465" offset="234443">Now, the Ledger paid 68 million dollars for the subscriber relationships of those eight papers when it acquired them, and there were... these were enormously valuable, 460,000 subscribers, because of the subscription income they produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.260" offset="309676">Now, these assets, the subscriber relationships, are wasting assets because they have limited lives, and for that reason Ledger seeks to depreciate them.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.174" offset="1449242">For example, if you had... one of the more illogical contentions in this case by the Third Circuit and by the Government is that we could depreciate the subscriber relationships if they were in fixed-term contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.068" offset="1516847">Now, I hope this goes to the question we're discussing.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.920" offset="1532311">Assume that Newark Morning Ledger had 460,000 fixed-term contracts with its subscribers.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.609" offset="1571077">Those, the Government will admit, could be capitalized and depreciated.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.727" offset="1591452">Then, Newark Morning Ledger begins to expend moneys and effort to get new subscribers under fixed-term contracts.</text>

            <text syncTime="390.044" offset="1696778">Those are a different asset all together, so there's no question of a double deduction or anything of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.282" offset="1721751">They purchased and capitalized the existing subscriber relationships as they tried to get new subscriber relationships, those were expensed under 173... different assets all together.</text>

            <text syncTime="461.140" offset="1981199">For example, couldn't people have gone out and surveyed the people buying papers at the newsstand and found, based on their answers, that, you know, most of them buy the paper 5 days a week and have done so for the last 20 years, or whatever the case may be, and if you got a sufficient factual base, couldn't the same kind of prediction be made?</text>

            <text syncTime="505.585" offset="2158937">In fact, that's a healthy development, because then you would know that they had limited lives and that you would have a wasting asset, and you would depreciate it, which fits the basic premise of the tax code of matching your expenses with your revenue to come up with net income, so if it were possible to do these additional things, that would be good from the point of view of the tax code.</text>

            <text syncTime="915.635" offset="3799113">You see, the fact is that this regulation we're dealing with now first came into effect in a slightly different form in 1919, not in 1927, as the Government says, and it said that if an intangible asset is known from experience to be of value for only a limited period, the length of which can be estimated from experience with reasonable certainty, such intangible asset may be the subject of a depreciation allowance, and I think this becomes important.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.070" offset="3920843">Then it said, there can be no such allowance in respect of goodwill, trade names, trademarks, trade brands, secret formulae, or processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.510" offset="3958669">Now, every one of those is an intangible with no limited life.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.097" offset="3972984">Now, when Prohibition was upon us, the IRS thought that the goodwill of a brewery or a distiller had a limited life, because Prohibition was going to cut the business off.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.757" offset="4035573">The court later said that it still wasn't... goodwill still couldn't be depreciated because it didn't fit the statute in terms of being exhausted or worn out, it was cut off by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.362" offset="4074025">But the IRS, when it allowed for the time being the depreciation of goodwill, said that the principle of depreciating assets whose... depreciating intangibles whose life is limited overrides the statement in the regulation that goodwill is not depreciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.776" offset="4159707">The rule of limited life requiring depreciability was said to be controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.113" offset="4177052">Now... and in fact the current revenue regulation... ruling states that it was issued to remove any implication that customer and subscription lists are as a matter of law indistinguishable from goodwill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.973" offset="4244448">It further states that the depreciability of assets of this nature is factual issue, so what we have here is a continuing course of a code, a regulation beginning in 1919 and up to date, a revenue ruling which is now in force, all of which contradict the Government's per se approach in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2025.250" offset="8237630">Now, the value in what petitioner refers to as its customer relationships, the property that petitioner has... because it's only property that under 167... section 167 of the code... that can be depreciated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.843" offset="8303981">The property is not the tangible property in the persons of the subscribers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2734.268" offset="11073692">The commissioner's regulations, the most recent regulations on goodwill, which happened not to be in effect at the time of this acquisition but which petitioner relied on in his opening brief, we describe in some detail in footnote 23 on page 27 of our brief, and we show that under the regulations it's the Class III assets which are the ones that are residual after goodwill and going-concern value are allocated, so they have to have a meaning other than residual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.951" offset="11272432">In the commissioner's own regulations, the terms of the commissioner's regulations show that the residual way of defining what goodwill is is inconsistent with the terms of the regulations as we point out in our analysis of the regulations and in the last sentence of that footnote, and petitioner did not choose to respond to that in petitioner's reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.434" offset="11382355">Goodwill is looked upon that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.053" offset="11396775">I think it might be illuminating if I could give the Court some rather simply hypothetical examples of purchases of businesses which show that the actual expectancy of continued patronage will be roughly the same, even though the circumstances of the business vary dramatically and the rate of customer turnover that would be expected, and one example that I could give would be three separate purchases of three separate, similar, prospering fast-food restaurants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.332" offset="11577960">In case A, the restaurant is in a residential area of a small to medium-size city such as these newspapers are published in, with a relatively stable population, and the customers consist in large part of young to middle-aged parents with their children, of young adults and teenagers who come in on their own, and the expectancy would be that, in another 10 or 15 years, many of these teenagers would be coming in as parents with their own children, many of the children presently coming in with their parents would be coming in as teenagers or young adults on their own, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.538" offset="11806793">Case B would be a similar prospering fast-food restaurant located directly across the street from a college campus with dormitories, and it can be shown that more than 90 percent of the existing customers will turn over within a 4-year time, yet the purchaser's expectancy would be that 5 years from now he would have roughly the same number of college students eating in the restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.461" offset="11946391">Case C would be a similar fast-food restaurant prospering that is located in a service area along an interstate highway or at an airport, or across the street from the entrance to a resort such as Disney World.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.088" offset="12020892">Most of the customers are seen for the last time when they walk out the door, or will come back only very seldom, but the expectancy is that the business will go on much as it has historically.</text>

            <text syncTime="3076.938" offset="12444390">I mean, of course it's less daunting for the purchaser of a business to be faced only with the task of maintaining an existing level of patronage than to try to build up a level of patronage that is not already existing in the business.</text>
