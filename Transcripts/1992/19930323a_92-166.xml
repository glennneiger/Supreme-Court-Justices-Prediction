            <text syncTime="8.578" offset="169310">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.191" offset="183729">This case involves the meaning of 28 U.S.C. section 1500, which says that the Court of Federal Claims shall not have jurisdiction over a claim against the United States if the plaintiff has pending in another court another case against the Government or its agents for or in respect to that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.353" offset="264395">The Federal circuit, expressly repudiating long-settled precedent, held that section 1500 automatically requires dismissal whenever the plaintiff had pending sometime during its suit another action growing out of the same transaction or operative facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="48.885" offset="330537">When you say, repudiating long-standing precedent, Mr. Taranto, you mean Federal circuit or Court of Claims precedent, right?</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_g_taranto" startTime="59.623" stopTime="147.131">
            <label>Mr. Richard G. Taranto</label>

            <text syncTime="59.813" offset="374214">Yes, that's right, and it required dismissal even if the actions had to be pursued separately, and even if the other action is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.478" offset="408905">Based on this new rule, petitioner came and had its cases dismissed after 10 years of pretrial proceedings were completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.713" offset="441819">Denying Keene a hearing on its claims based on the Government's sale of asbestos, its requirement of asbestos in products it's purchased, and its manner of operating shipyards.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.062" offset="487272">Our position is that the Federal circuit misconstrued section 1500 in two respects, and that two longstanding constructions of 1500 should be reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.818" offset="526247">First, two suits are not for or in respect to the same claim where Congress has insisted that the claims in the two suits are different by demanding that they must be brought separately, and second, by its plain terms, the statute does not apply after the plaintiff no longer has pending any other suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.671" offset="609630">Now, on the first position, I want to make four points.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.524" offset="625094">The first is that it was settled law in the Court of Claims and the Federal circuit, two of the only courts, aside from this Court, that could ever address this question, for more than a quarter of a century, that when Congress has declared that two separate rights of action must be litigated in two different courts, the court should not turn around and read 1500 as saying that the two suits are really for and in respect to the same claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="147.131" offset="723524">On what general principle of law do you base this argument, Mr. Taranto?</text>
            <text syncTime="151.121" offset="739510">I mean, we don't ordinarily review Court of Claims or Federal circuit precedent.</text>

            <text syncTime="157.048" offset="763125">I think that... well, stare decisis in its strict terms perhaps applies only to this Court's review of its own precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.034" offset="799070">Nevertheless, because stare decisis is a policy-based doctrine the same--</text>

            <text syncTime="171.189" offset="819759">We wouldn't take a case here, I don't think, to hear it argued that the Ninth Circuit had failed to follow stare decisis in connection with a Ninth Circuit precedent.</text>

            <text syncTime="180.755" offset="858002">--No, I think that's right, but this, I think, presents two unique circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.799" offset="874198">One is that the issue of 1500's interpretation is unique to the Federal circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.671" offset="897708">There can't be a lower court conflict, and as a consequence, all of the reliant's interest both of litigants like Keene and of Congress in legislating in the area, must necessarily look to established law in that circuit to guide litigants and guide Congress, and it's for that reason that we think that cases like the Casman line of cases demand special respect.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="215.349" offset="996346">But I... you would still say that even if there hadn't been a precedent until this one, that the court of appeals just had it wrong.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="229.960" offset="1054861">And since it would be the only court to construe that statute, you couldn't wait for a conflict.</text>

            <text syncTime="241.818" offset="1102299">The reading that the Court of Claims and the Federal circuit gave to the statute for a quarter of a century in fact we think reflects the most natural reading of 1500's language.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="252.885" offset="1146498">Are you in any position to make an argument that Congress might be deemed to have accepted that interpretation?</text>
            <text syncTime="258.230" offset="1167919">Was there any reenactment or amendment that might have picked it up if we accepted the theory that, given the peculiarities of claims in the Fed circuit jurisdiction, Congress might be deemed to accept that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_g_taranto" startTime="270.170" stopTime="320.303">
            <label>Mr. Richard G. Taranto</label>
            <text syncTime="270.170" offset="1215670">Yes, we do have a version of that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.270" offset="1228105">In 1982, Congress took a broad look at the whole set of statutes governing what was then the Court of Claims, transformed that court into a trial court, claims court and the Federal circuit, and reenacted 1500, merely changing the name of the court to which it applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.851" offset="1298426">By that time, the statute had been consistently construed in both of the ways that we suggest, and we think it is an appropriate inference that had it been construed otherwise, its quite draconian consequences would in fact have led Congress to take a second look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.154" offset="1371569">The fact that it had been construed so as not to deprive litigants of rights is I think the best explanation for why no real issue was made of 1500 when it was reenacted in 1982.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="320.303" offset="1416186">Well, did Congress overhaul the statutes governing the Court of Claims and the Federal circuit in 1982 other than just do what was necessary to create the new court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_g_taranto" startTime="335.012" stopTime="371.968">
            <label>Mr. Richard G. Taranto</label>
            <text syncTime="335.012" offset="1475014">It did make a number of substantive amendments in looking through the entire range of statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.997" offset="1506988">It added certain limited jurisdiction to the... now the claims court to provide certain kinds of equitable relief that it couldn't have provided before.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.022" offset="1543037">It provided a special transfer statute to ensure against precisely the kind of loss of rights for filing in the wrong court that is at issue here, and it also made a number of substantive amendments that governed other aspects of what used to be the Court of Claims and also the court of customs and--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="371.968" offset="1622867">Amendments you say that weren't occasioned by the creation of the new court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard G. Taranto</label>
            <text syncTime="375.938" offset="1638750">--Yes, that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.010" offset="1643034">It was a more general review in 1982 of the statutory regime governing suits against the United States, and in particular in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.706" offset="1677829">When the statute asks if a second suit is for and respect to the claim in a first suit, it is naturally understood, we think, as targeting repetitive litigation, situations where two suits are brought when there really should be one, but that is not the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.927" offset="1742717">There is no repetition when two suits are brought on different legal rights that Congress has said must be litigated separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.560" offset="1769257">This is exactly the rule of claim preclusion law, which we think is the obvious place to turn to in defining when two suits should be treated as for or in respect to the same claim.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="420.317" offset="1816278">But you wouldn't need a special statute, would you, if all Congress wanted was the application of claim preclusion law?</text>
            <text syncTime="427.293" offset="1844177">That would apply without any statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.496" offset="1852954">Certainly other courts throughout the country apply it without having a special statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="434.631" offset="1873538">What 1500 does is apply before any judgment is reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.452" offset="1892764">Claim preclusion law only kicks in once there is a judgment in a first suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.737" offset="1909901">What 1500 does is to say a plaintiff cannot proceed in two different forums up to the time of judgment, which claim preclusion would say nothing about.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.732" offset="1949920">It protects the Government against that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.583" offset="1961310">So 1500 performs a role in addition to claim preclusion law, but we never--</text>

            <text syncTime="461.830" offset="1982312">But would that interpretation that you've just explained have satisfied the congressional concern with the cotton litigation that prompted this statute?</text>

            <text syncTime="471.704" offset="2021809">Let me say first that I think that it would be a mistake, in any event, whatever that 1868 legislative history concerning the cotton claim said, to carry that forward to the new statute in a new legal landscape to control the interpretation of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.296" offset="2088160">But even on its own terms, the only thing that one can tell from the 1868 history is that Congress wanted to relax one condition of claim preclusion law, and that is the condition of mutuality of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.735" offset="2137897">Nothing about the 1868 history suggested that two claims, aside from mutuality of the parties that would otherwise be the same, would be within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.554" offset="2181156">The cotton claims would, under the best view that we can discover of 19th Century res judicata law, in fact have been the same had they been against the same defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.159" offset="2223579">One of the tests for establishing sameness of claims was the so-called same evidence rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.302" offset="2244164">If the evidence in one case would be enough to support the claim in the other case, the same evidence would suffice in the claims, it would be treated the same, and a common law conversion claim would under that test be the same as the statutory conversion claim which added simply the element of loyalty, because the same evidence that proved loyalty in conversion would, as with a lesser included offense, prove conversion.</text>

            <text syncTime="860.920" offset="3578707">And these functions are obviously modest, but as I say, the Justice Department explained why 1500 should be kept, when it opposed repeal to Congress by reference only to those functions and not to the much more draconian function that it suggests today of sequencing merely related suits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1134.440" offset="4672715">In fact, the court said the case should go forward once that defect is cured.</text>

            <text syncTime="1478.396" offset="6048533">It was a provision about what should happen in the filing and the prosecution of a claim, and there I think the language helps us considerably, because one would not ordinarily think that a rule like that should automatically carry the rigid dismissal result as a matter of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.380" offset="6124497">There would still be an open question about what the remedy is for the violation of a filing rule, and it's that flexibility as to remedy that in fact the Court of Claims itself regularly applied, starting in the 1960's, time and time again to merely require a stay of the case, or a suspension of the case, and that rule says two things: 1) what is at issue here, which is that the case goes forward once the defect is no longer present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.070" offset="6247272">The other thing that it says, which is not present here, is that even at the time the defect is present, dismissal is not required, mere suspension will do, and I should note that in the Pennsylvania Railroad case, that is exactly what this Court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.489" offset="6300980">It reversed a Court of Claims dismissal of the case and ordered the Court of Claims merely to suspend the proceeding while another case in district court was proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1652.649" offset="6745584">The text of section 1500 speaks in the language of subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.807" offset="6778185">It unmistakably excludes a certain category of cases from the subject matter jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.553" offset="6825205">That court's sole function is to hear claims against the United States for monetary awards and occasionally certain ancillary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.822" offset="6882257">These are claims against the sovereign, and just as waivers of sovereign immunity are to be strictly construed, an express exclusion from the waiver of sovereign immunity that Congress has enacted should be fairly construed to accomplish its purpose of restricting the waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.722" offset="7001897">So much of the argument that has been made on behalf of the petitioner in this case that claims that Congress has authorized might be foreclosed by this provision overlooks the fact that this provision is an exclusion on the waiver of sovereign immunity, and to the extent this provision applies, the claims are not authorized against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.463" offset="7120807">From the beginning in 1868, when the predecessor statute was enacted, the central purpose was clear, and that was to prevent simultaneous litigation of related claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1972.279" offset="8024121">The one significant change that was made in the statute was made to carry this function forward after the enactment of the Federal Tort Claims Act in 1946, in which these suits, the tort claims that formally had to be made against officers could now be made against the United States, and so in the 1948 addition of the Judicial Code, as the revisers redrafted this, they added suits against the United States in any other court to the original language that referred only to suits against officers in any other court, so the substance was being carried forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.027" offset="8235086">In fact, the revisers' note said this was nothing but a change in phraseology, but the substance of precluding putting the Government to simultaneous defense of the tort suit in the district court and the claim in the then Court of Claims was carried forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.915" offset="8334665">The plaintiff could not force that choice upon the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.879" offset="8366534">Now, in the rehearing petition that the Government filed in this case in the Federal circuit, I think the Government articulated two important, telling points that I believe led the court in the Federal circuit to reexamine its series of precedents in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.679" offset="8489728">The first point that I want to recount to the Court has to do with the purpose of the rule, and why the rule applied to the situation that Keene had presented to the Court, and as the Government put it in the rehearing petition, the rule propounded by the panel whereby if the claimant dismissed its district court case before the Court of Federal Claims ruled on the motion to dismiss, then it would have been all right for the two suits to go forward simultaneously, one of the alternative grounds proposed by petitioner today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.610" offset="8665375">What we said in the rehearing petition was, the rule propounded by the panel would permit a claimant to tie up Government resources in two courts simultaneously for an indefinite period of time while the claimant continues to assess its relative chances of recovery in one forum or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.226" offset="8759938">As long as the claimant bails out of the district court before the claims court actually rules on the section 1500 motion, the claimant can do, as plaintiffs did here, precisely what Congress intended to preclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.726" offset="8825871">Now, in this particular case, the suit that was initially pending in the district court was a third-party complaint against the United States involving just one of these asbestos claims, but we have to be aware that even though the suit in the... later brought in the Court of Federal Claims against the Government was an omnibus suit involving many similar claims, we have to be aware that modern rules of collateral estoppel would allow an individual suit of that sort to be used as a stalking horse, and if it looked as if that suit would succeed, it could go forward and then be used for its possible collateral estoppel effect against the Government under this Court's decision in United States against Stauffer Chemical Company.</text>

            <text syncTime="3395.414" offset="13716621">The first is that Keene certainly relied on what was a clear rule, whatever the type of relief, in separately filing its tort and contract actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3475.106" offset="14035419">First, on the has pending question, that's a separate line of authority under which it was absolutely clear and without any kind of dispute that once the other suit was over, the Court of Claims action proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.245" offset="14084007">We win our case under that exception without regard to the scope of claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.587" offset="14101352">As to the scope of claim, Casman enunciated a principle that said if different types of relief are sought, they're not the same claim because the cases have to be brought in different forums.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.026" offset="14155060">It then extended that principle to its natural scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.658" offset="14173659">Whenever two different claims had to be brought in different forums, they were not the same, and I don't know of a single case in which it was restricted to claims involving different types of relief.</text>
