            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="132663">We'll hear argument now in number 91-7580, Gary Graham v. James A. Collins.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.936" offset="168399">Mr. Tigar.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael E. Tigar</label>
            <text syncTime="9.798" offset="171847">Mr. Chief Justice of the United States, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.613" offset="199014">Gary Graham was 17 years old and the product of a profoundly troubled family background when he struggled with, shot, and killed Bobby Grant Lambert in the supermarket parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.720" offset="247497">His case, and the issues presented today, must be resolved, we suggest, by reference to precedent, experience, and tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.406" offset="290234">Precedent, in the guise of Locket and Eddings, yes, and Stanford v. Kentucky, in which the Court has repeated over and over again the powerful mitigating force of youth, and yes, precedent in the sense of Penry v. Lynaugh, because this case, we submit, is stronger for us than Penry's was for him because of the role of youth in this Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence and because of the presence here, as in Eddings, of the potentiating force of the family background coupled with the evidence of youth.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.752" offset="451670">And it is weaker for the respondent than their position was in Penry, not simply because Penry has in the interim been decided, not simply because the prosecutor here, as in Penry, sought to make the second Texas special issue into a double-edged sword by arguing that the condition in fact made the defendant more dangerous, but also because in this case the trial judge told the jury over and over again in voir dire, or voir dire, whatever one prefers, that they were to consider the special issue language in ways that cabined, confined, and constricted those special issues, cabined and confined them so there was no chance that the promise of Jurek could be redeemed.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.097" offset="656993">Jurek was premised on a promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.481" offset="666501">The Court said that it appeared the State... that the jury could consider certain things and the Court said that right after a paragraph in which it enumerated age as among the things it thought of constitutional significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.458" offset="714462">That's the promise that has not been redeemed.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.882" offset="728150">That is why Judge Higginbotham in the court below said that this case is governed by precedent, so I turn to the issues that the jury had before it, those special issues 1 and 2, because those are the significant ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.540" offset="790740">Special issue number 1 has to do with deliberateness, and yet the trial judge told the jury that that meant nothing more than intentionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.217" offset="837447">That is to say, the same element of the offense of which Gary Graham then stood convicted, because that's the element under 6.02(a) of the Texas Penal Code that is a part of first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.995" offset="884572">Special issue 2, future dangerousness... here, as in Penry, both double-edged and under-inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.831" offset="915919">It's double-edged because Gary Graham is 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.632" offset="931174">He has a longer time before he got old enough to outgrow the kinds of behavior the trial judge said satisfied future dangerousness: doing wheelies with your Harley on a lawn, pouring paint on a car... those sorts of relatively trivial offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.043" offset="1000764">Double-edged because there is in this court's cases a deep and, we say, rationally-based social consensus that youth is mitigating in and of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.711" offset="1047471">That is to say, that it's mitigating beyond what it may have in terms of predictive ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.388" offset="1090207">The prosecutor emphasized the double-edged point by saying as the seed is planted so grows the sprout, as the twig is bent, so grows the tree.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="250.116" stopTime="271.791">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="250.116" offset="1133048">If we accept that, do we have to overrule Jurek, because Jurek was premised on the fact that the moral significance could theoretically at least be considered within the framework of the questions, and I'm not sure that the youth consideration could meet the test, as you describe it, unless we overrule Jurek?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_e_tigar" startTime="271.791" stopTime="328.439">
            <label>Mr. Michael E. Tigar</label>
            <text syncTime="271.791" offset="1219775">No, Justice Souter, we do not ask you to overrule Jurek, any more than the State asks you to overrule Penry.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.935" offset="1244330">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.746" offset="1247569">Penry said there would have to be an additional instruction beyond the special issue, and all Jurek says is that the jury may be asked to consider whatever evidence of mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.777" offset="1299710">Jurek didn't say that it had to be within the special issues, and the problem, Justice Souter, is created by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which in Black v. State says, we will not retreat a millimeter back from the language of the special issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.963" offset="1352477">We won't authorize giving any extra instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.715" offset="1363448">It's futile to ask for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.227" offset="1369509">So no, we don't think that Jurek should be overruled, and in fact the Court's opinion in Franklin stands as a testament that under certain circumstances, perhaps many, Jurek and what this Court said in Jurek, what it said in later cases, can live quite happily together without questioning Jurek.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="328.439" offset="1446413">Well, it seems, Mr. Tigar, that in almost any case there's going to be some evidence of troubled background, positive character traits, so I'm not sure where the limits of your rule are.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.669" offset="1511301">I have the same experience as Mr. Justice Souter does.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.802" offset="1523840">It seems to me that in order to rule for you we have to overrule, if not Jurek, certainly Franklin--</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael E. Tigar</label>
            <text syncTime="356.068" offset="1556859">--At the margin, there are surely cases in which these issues are raised... for example, in Boyd v. California or Franklin itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.935" offset="1592385">This is a case of a 17-year-old whose mother was in and out of mental hospitals 20 or 30 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.219" offset="1617463">So I look to Eddings, which is the closest case, and see if maybe there's an opinion for the majority of the Court that answers your question, and I think it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.015" offset="1652676">The Court there identified two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.565" offset="1662916">First, factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.735" offset="1667514">The Eighth Amendment mandates that certain factors shall be considered as mitigating, and youth is surely among them if we take Stanford.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.942" offset="1700428">A troubled family background surely is among them.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.874" offset="1712131">Then the question is, if the factor has been identified, what evidence, and the Eighth Amendment also mandates that the defendant be able to put on evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.178" offset="1749329">Now, surely, once the State has done that job as it has done in the three statutes that the State in this case clings to as good ones... Saffle, Blystone, and Boyde... then we say that there can be a question, the threshold question, as to whether the evidence proffered entitles the defendant to an instruction that as whether the evidence goes to or sufficiently relates to one of the constitutionally identified mitigating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.628" offset="1867089">That's a common question in all kinds of criminal cases in those not involving the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.712" offset="1891435">The Court started its opinion in Jacobson, for example, by noting that if the evidence has been different, Jacobson, quote, would not even have been entitled to an instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.986" offset="1924559">The Court's been wrestling with that threshold issue ever since the 19th Century, and we suggest that those standards could be applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.070" offset="1948905">But the third way, and this is... in which the evidence is under-inclusive is precisely because of Eddings, that very powerful analysis, particularly in footnote 11, about the consensus that adolescents tend to be dangerous, particularly in the teenage years, that there's a sense that it maybe society's fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.714" offset="2031452">Not that that's dispositive, or that you or I or any of us would say that it is in a particular case, but that the sentencer, in the words of Eddings, Locket requires the sentencer to listen.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.214" offset="2077427">That comes back to the Jurek point.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.088" offset="2096967">Penry says you need an additional instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.210" offset="2105430">That's consistent with Jurek, and why?</text>
            <text syncTime="496.001" offset="2116611">Because of what the Court said in Griffin, which is not a capital punishment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.736" offset="2135523">In Griffin the Court said juror intuition takes care of a lot of problems about what the facts are, but we certainly do not expect juror intuition to be able to deal with what the law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.472" offset="2182544">That won't... their intuition can't save them from the failure of the Court to instruct correctly on the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.206" offset="2205427">And another analogy that we draw that we think is powerful is last term's decision in Morgan v. Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.589" offset="2230923">If seating one juror who says, I ain't following those mitigating instructions, is an error, how much more of an error is it if the judge says in effect to the jurors, you can't consider the mitigating evidence, which is what was said here?</text>
            <text syncTime="541.532" offset="2298736">Because when the judge had finished with his constricted view of the law, the last thing he said to this jury before they deliberated the fate of this 17-year-old young man was, you take your law from me.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.607" offset="2339070">Your other judge is the facts, but you take your law from me.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.989" offset="2352549">Beyond, then, the issue of precedent, it seems to us that the Fifth Circuit has missed the Eddings point Interestingly, the respondent doesn't embrace the Fifth Circuit's opinion we deal with in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.414" offset="2430289">It seems to us that the Fifth Circuit has mistaken a reweighing of evidence for this constitutional duty under Eddings to look at the factors that are mitigating and make sure the jury hears about the factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.250" offset="2481594">The second element, if the Court please, is experience, and by experience I mean the power that this Court has traditionally recognized attaches to evidence of youth, and that runs through many of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.252" offset="2553587">Gary Graham was 17 when he killed Bobby Grant Lambert.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.595" offset="2566962">Nathan Leopold was 18 when he killed his victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.467" offset="2578456">And Gary Graham doesn't say he has a constitutional right to Leopold's result any more than he has the right to an advocate as eloquent as Leopold's advocate, but he does have the right to have his sentencer free to consider the power of this mitigating evidence that this Court has repeatedly identified as powerful in the way that this Court's decisions teach.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.680" offset="2663301">The whole life of childhood, said Leopold's counsel, is a dream and an illusion, and whether they take one shape or another depends not upon the dreamy boy but upon what surrounds him, evidence that evokes what Justice Powell said for the Court in footnote 11 in Eddings.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.201" offset="2729443">I suggest they want you to forget as justices that which you know as lawyers who have tried and presided over cases, that which you know as men and women, and that that Judge Higginbotham in his dissent identified as the power of this evidence based on his experience as an able trial lawyer and a trial judge before he went on the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.474" offset="2810527">And of course, beyond experience there is tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.307" offset="2833829">That's one reason I say that the case is stronger for us than Penry's.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.192" offset="2853368">The mitigating power of youth is recognized in our legal tradition for at least 2,200 years, and we can trace it back that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.231" offset="2909584">In Stanford v. Kentucky this Court called out the roll call of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.895" offset="2940199">It began by saying that one sure guide to the Eighth Amendment duty of the Court is to look at statutes passed by society's elected representatives, and then the Court called out in this roll call 29 States that expressly make youth a mitigating factor... 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.641" offset="3031210">And then, having done that, it's clear from Stanford and from reading the statutes of the other States that if they don't mention youth expressly that they all have one of these catch-all clauses, catch-all mitigating clauses that the Court has sustained in such cases as Boyde and Blystone and Saffle that permit the lawyers to argue it without being headed off at the pass by prosecutorial or judicial argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.060" offset="3148865">Now, in response to these contentions that we make, the State does a number of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.011" offset="3208634">It has some statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.852" offset="3220023">We didn't bother to answer those in our reply brief because they formed no part of the record below and we think that the Court ought not to consider them, that had they... not having been subjected to adversary scrutiny, they don't belong in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.643" offset="3279164">But it's interesting to note that if you move the age from 23 to 24, that the alleged disparity shrinks to.5 percent instead of whatever they say it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.987" offset="3320542">It's interesting to note that there are 82, not 81 youths that got the life sentence, so their arithmetic is off, and it's also interesting to note that if you run the elementary statistical test of the null hypothesis, that the results cannot be attributed to anything more significant than chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.277" offset="3377698">But as I say, I don't think that the Court needs to reach that.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.671" offset="3395252">The question might also arise in the Court's decision, well, what should we do about marginal cases?</text>
            <text syncTime="824.296" offset="3429839">What does age mean, because that's in the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.709" offset="3443422">Our contention is this: that age means that at least the teenage years as identified in Eddings, that the Fifth Circuit says 22, the State is willing to say 23, and that time enough to resolve that question, because the States are answering it.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.419" offset="3518237">This is a case of a 17-year-old, and as to 17-year-olds, as to the mitigating force of youth for them, after Penry, Oregon and Texas stood alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.768" offset="3563690">Oregon quickly changed its practice and then its statute, and as we point out in our brief, Texas then amended its statute with the aid of lawyers from the Attorney General's Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.158" offset="3613218">Indeed, the reason for that amendment is not hard to find when one reads the stunning concession at page 28 of the Attorney General's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.351" offset="3649999">That is to say, the statutory terms at issue relate to matters that might support affirmative answers to the special issues, i.e., aggravating factors that have no logical connection to the inquiry as to whether a rational jury could give effect to Graham's mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.742" offset="3719589">In short, the State seems to be saying that the factors are probably on their face more adapted to the aggravators, and that additional instructions as required in Penry might be the answer to redeeming the Jurek promise, that under those circumstances, particularly when you have the instructions in an as-applied way constricted and confined by the trial judge's instructions and by the prosecutor's argument, there's no chance that the mitigating force of this evidence could have been appreciated by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.607" offset="3867024">If we are to go back, then, to that most objective and reliable indicium... that is to say, what the States have done... it is clear that this is a little like Coker v. Georgia, where, as the Court noted in Stanford, Georgia stood alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.409" offset="3938286">Here, Texas stands alone, but within its own house it is divided against itself, for by its legislative enactment it has recognized that the mitigating evidence that could not be considered under the former statute must now be given a chance to be heard by the sentencer.</text>

            <text syncTime="997.357" offset="4122083">Yes, Justice O'Connor, that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.380" offset="4130129">We were asking the Court to illuminate what it means by the word character in the character on record and then circumstances of the offense language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.835" offset="4167954">Character evidence is... of course, is not receivable unless it passes some minimal threshold of relevance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.733" offset="4203585">That comes back, we believe, to the factors evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.815" offset="4211840">Here, the positive character traits must be considered... again, Eddings I think is our best case... because these positive character traits existed despite the troubled family background.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.011" offset="4264607">That is, some... I don't think that Hitchcock comes out as it does just because Mr. Hitchcock is a kind uncle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.117" offset="4293029">I think Mr. Hitchcock's kind uncleness is important because, after a lifetime of adversity, he still manages to do that, and here Mr. Graham loves the Lord, cares for the children that he had, and shows these traits despite what's happened to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.337" offset="4353946">So we say that whatever the threshold is, we meet it, but also looking to such cases as Boyde, in which the Court has quite frankly assessed the relevance of the evidence to a factor already identified and said that there might be some threshold that somebody would have to meet, that that standard, or that analysis would permit the Court to draw a line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.454" offset="4458436">Our view is that wherever the line is drawn, we have to disagree with the Fifth Circuit, because on this record the combination of circumstances is even more powerful than the Eddings combination as to which the Court said you had to look at it as a whole and that the sentencer there was not authorized to just focus on you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1109.762" offset="4571703">You mention in your brief that there is perhaps a theoretical flaw, or at least a theoretical inadequacy in placing great reliance on the second Texas question, the prediction of future dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.150" offset="4629172">Because that is basically... by its very nature it is a predictive inquiry, whereas the judgment which must be expressed consistent with Eddings and Locket is a moral judgment about the individual and the act, if we accept the view that the second question, the predictive question is in fact not a moral question, let's say in a utilitarian sense or a moral inquiry in a utilitarian sense, does it follow from your argument, if we accept it, that there will for practical purposes always have to be a Penry kind of catch-all question?</text>

            <text syncTime="1165.228" offset="4793535">No, it does not, Justice Souter, and I think Franklin is the answer to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.802" offset="4819866">Franklin did not contend that his evidence, however characterized, did more than help the jury answer no to the second question, so that there is a case in which the Court said, it's adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.382" offset="4878172">The concession the State makes at page 28 of its brief, however, troubles me, as your question troubles me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.858" offset="4908056">I suggest to the Court that the problem is this, that maybe it's true, and the Court could conclude that the second question simply isn't adequate to that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.317" offset="4957897">That is, in this calculus of which you speak, it really is an aggravator only, as the State seems to suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.713" offset="4987468">Then all that would mean, however, is that in order to redeem the promise of Jurek, the State Court of Criminal Appeals would have to moderate its language a little bit, and instead of saying things like, we will never retreat, it would have to pay attention to what this Court made the quid pro quo for upholding the statute on its face in Jurek.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.916" offset="5076284">That is to say, to accommodate the statute to circumstances that are presented to it, the State had this opportunity and has repeatedly refused to avail itself of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.254" offset="5117662">It was one reason why the claim couldn't conceivably be procedurally defaulted, because it was so cleared of futility, but I hope I've answered your question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1312.749" offset="5383589">One would think that if Graham's mitigating evidence were as compelling as he suggests, that it would be included in the join appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.343" offset="5413995">It is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.153" offset="5421205">The joint appendix consists of 612 pages, 434 of which are devoted to voir dire, a matter that to my mind at least does not bear on the question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.779" offset="5459762">Graham's punishment phase evidence, by contrast, is quite scant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.853" offset="5476062">It may be found in the record at volume 20, pages 474 to 86.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.595" offset="5494975">It occupies 13 pages of the record, and would have occupied 7 pages of the joint appendix, yet it is not included.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.570" offset="5526844">Examination of the record reveals, I believe, the reason for this omission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.274" offset="5545757">For instance, Graham tells us that he worked a job to support his two children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.379" offset="5570103">The basis for this assertion is six lines of hearsay testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.612" offset="5591105">There is absolutely no competent evidence in the record that Graham was gainfully employed or that he supported his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.526" offset="5618691">In the same theme, Graham's assertion that his 17 years had been characterized by religious devotion, again, the only basis for this assertion is four lines of his grandmother's testimony that he attended church with her between the ages of 3 and 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.836" offset="5683997">She admitted that she had no knowledge of his activities after the age of 11, and there is absolutely no other evidence of his supposedly religious nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.943" offset="5720359">As to Graham's troubled childhood, the only basis for this assertion is 15 lines of testimony from the grandmother.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.330" offset="5757976">There is no evidence that Graham was mistreated in any way as a child, and there is absolutely no showing that any event of his childhood contributed to make him the extremely violent person he had become at the age of 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.547" offset="5806772">In addition, Graham misconstrues the record of the voir dire examination at his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.141" offset="5829133">While the judge and counsel for both the State and Graham offered varying definitions of the word, deliberately, the trial court did not in fact define that word for the venir members so as to reduce the State's burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.853" offset="5908023">The record shows that the trial court repeatedly advised the venir members that the term would not be defined at trial and they were to use their own common sense interpretation of what the word deliberately means in answering the first special issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.746" offset="5975628">To support that statement, I would refer the Court to the joint appendix at pages 90, 169, 205, 291, 353, and 419.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.012" offset="6024634">Finally, Graham's assertion that the trial court's definition of the term, criminal acts of violence, somehow reduced the State's burden of proof on the second special issue is likewise reputed by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.843" offset="6087954">The examples offered by the trial court of relatively minor offenses were included in a broad definition of that term, which also referred to robbery, rape, and murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.980" offset="6128496">Again, as with the term, deliberately, the trial court told the venir members that criminal acts of violence would not be defined at their trial, and as with the term, deliberately, the jurors would use their own common sense interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.789" offset="6183772">Not only is Graham's claim factually lacking, it also is untenable as a matter of law under Jurek.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.722" offset="6211461">In Jurek, this Court upheld the constitutionality of the statute at issue here precisely because it allows the jury to consider whatever evidence of mitigating circumstances the defense can bring before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.220" offset="6261512">The Jurek court did not believe that the special issues were so narrow as to foreclose consideration of mitigating evidence, but instead found that they got in focus the jury's consideration of the circumstances of the individual offender and his offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.581" offset="6330893">Jurek controls Graham's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.324" offset="6341865">There, as here, the defendant was a young person at the time of his offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.399" offset="6362240">Both the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and the Fifth Circuit have held that youth includes defendants up to the age of 23 at the time of their offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.175" offset="6405290">Graham acknowledges, as he must under Jurek, that his jury could give mitigating effect to his youth in answering the second special issue, but he claims that it had relevance outside the scope of the Texas statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.724" offset="6471536">As the court of appeals observed, though, to say that youth cannot be considered under the special issues is necessarily to say that any evidence to which a defendant ascribes mitigating value cannot be considered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1599.995" offset="6532559">Are you going to get to his specific argument that in this case he was sufficiently young so that when, for purposes of the second question, future dangerousness, the jurors considered that youth, their likely response would be that he is so young that even after conviction he's still going to remain young, and it's going to be quite some time before he outgrows the impulsiveness, violence, whatever the case may be, and therefore, considering youth, it really must be considered as an aggravating factor rather than a mitigating one, with the result, unless there is a special Penry kind of circuit-breaker here, that there would be no way to consider the youth as a mitigating factor?</text>

            <text syncTime="1650.999" offset="6736627">My response is, Your Honor, that examination of the trial record reveals that youth was offered for one purpose only, and that was to show that Graham would not be a future danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.315" offset="6773825">Although Graham introduced no evidence of his age at the time of the offense, he was tried 5 months after the offense, and the jury was able to observe his apparent age at the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.834" offset="6823981">In addition, defense counsel stated without objection that Graham had been 17 at the time of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.458" offset="6846446">Defense counsel argued that because of his youth Graham had, and I'm essentially paraphrasing his closing argument, had redeeming value, that he could be rehabilitated, that he would change, would slow down, if his life were spared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.466" offset="6902452">The record is devoid of any suggestion that Graham wished for his youth to be considered for any other purpose at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.839" offset="6931919">The trial court was not requested to give the supplemental instruction to which Graham claims he is now entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.584" offset="6958981">Perhaps most damaging to Graham, rather than whatever aggravating quality might be attached to his youth is the fact that the State proved that he was a demonstrably violent person, as evidenced by the number of extraneous offenses they introduced at the punishment phase of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.777" offset="7039752">The State, as recited in our brief, proved up a number of robberies and rapes committed by Graham over a 1-week period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.684" offset="7071308">In addition, they offered the testimony of a juvenile probation officer that Graham's reputation for being a peaceful and law-abiding citizen is bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.398" offset="7110178">Her evidence... her testimony obviously supports the inference that prior to this 1 week in May of 1981 he had not been a model citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.027" offset="7144764">If, however, Your Honor, we accept the definition of youth as given by the Court of Criminal Appeals in the Fifth Circuit, we have to consider it as going all the way up to 23, in which case it falls apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.277" offset="7217698">A 23-year-old defendant cannot make the same argument as Graham can.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.319" offset="7229923">Indeed, a 17-year-old defendant who is... obtains a reversal of his conviction, is retried at the age of 24, cannot make that argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="2471.094" offset="10016980">I think that much can be gleaned from Graham's brief in this case where he lists the qualities of youth that are deemed to be mitigating, and among them is impulsiveness, the inability to think rationally or maturely before acting, obviously deliberate is going to be the converse of impulsive, and if a quality of youth is impulsiveness, then just as obviously the deliberateness inquiry will encompass that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.383" offset="10134113">As I was saying moments ago, the class is narrowed at the guilt phase, then we have the punishment phase at which the State bears the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on all of the special issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="2537.627" offset="10283115">The defendant is allowed to introduce whatever evidence he wishes in mitigation, and the jury normally is instructed, as it was in Graham's case at page 10 of the joint appendix, that it is to consider all the evidence presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.468" offset="10338495">Not only is there no instruction limiting the jury's consideration of that evidence, but it is in fact instructed to consider all of the evidence introduced at both phases of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.034" offset="10380709">Penry simply held, we believe, that supplemental instructions were required in that case to allow the jury to give effect to his mental retardation and childhood abuse as mitigating factors, and that holding followed from the recognition that although Penry's evidence had mitigating quality, that it was essentially aggravating as to the future dangerousness inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2833.040" offset="11464790">As an initial matter, I would note that it is incorrect, as Graham asserts at footnote 11 of his reply brief, that the Office of the Attorney General drafted and sponsored the new statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.868" offset="11512124">In fact, the statute that was passed is not the one that was drafted and supported by our office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.723" offset="11539501">That matter aside, it can hardly be doubted the legislature acted prudently in responding to the Penry court's concerns, and in amending the statute they necessarily did so broadly enough to encompass the class of Penry excludables.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.853" offset="11600000">Their action in doing so, however, should not be taken as a concession as to the validity of the 360 remaining convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.598" offset="11638975">I think this assertion is perhaps supported by the fact that there have been 21 executions that have taken place since Penry, all under the old statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael E. Tigar</label>
            <text syncTime="2983.020" offset="12064666">We have a watershed difference here about what the jury was told in this case as to special issue number 1 and the intent element of the offense, and something of a difference about Texas law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.398" offset="12114194">I'd like to try to resolve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.158" offset="12121195">At pages 6 and 7 of our brief, quoting from the joint appendix, we have extensive quotations from the voir dire as to what the jurors were told: deliberately means that in my mind anyway it is a person's intention to do something, and other remarks to the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.669" offset="12183262">At joint appendix 5, we have the jury instructions given in the guilt phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.340" offset="12201966">Intentionally, or with intent with respect to the nature of his conduct, or to a result of his conduct when it is his conscious objective or desire to engage in the conduct or cause the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.309" offset="12249822">Now, all that complicated language does is read out section 6.02(a) of the Texas Penal Code, which differs from the model penal code quadripartite intent elements only in that Texas chooses to use the word intention rather than purposefulness, which is the more preferred model penal code formulation, but then when it's defined, it's the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.047" offset="12360790">It's in terms of this conscious objective or desire, so there can't be any doubt that the trial judge conflated these two standards and thus took care of any mitigating force that might have been in special issue number 1.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="3071.357" offset="12418051">Well, is the jury entitled to consider the strength of the State's evidence on intent?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael E. Tigar</label>
            <text syncTime="3076.901" offset="12440203">The standard of proof, Justice Kennedy, is the same with respect to both of the elements, so that there really isn't any opportunity for the jury to do other than look again to the same things they looked at plus, of course, to the additional aggravating evidence when they get on to the punishment phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.175" offset="12533303">That's the difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.568" offset="12546887">Then we look at Black v. State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.101" offset="12560993">Now, that's a post-Penry decision, and there's a defendant up in--</text>

            <text syncTime="3111.044" offset="12576771">Mr. Tigar, your argument that you just made that in this case the judge conflated this and that, I suppose that doesn't go to the facial validity of the Texas statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3132.547" offset="12662766">And so you might win this case, but if the trial judge had spoken differently you might lose it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3138.500" offset="12686590">--That's correct, Justice White, and we might lose... might have lost this case if the defendant were 25 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.516" offset="12714697">I mean, if the case were a different one than it was at the margin as opposed to right in the center, then there'd be a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.522" offset="12742701">That's the meaning of an as-applied challenge, and if I may interrupt my Black v. State discussion, that's what we think is wrong with the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.455" offset="12778436">The court of appeals turns Penry on its head, because it doesn't look at this question of youth in its relationship to the very thing that the Court identified in Eddings as central.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.975" offset="12832562">Instead, it goes off on this future dangerousness thing and analyzes it in that regard and then gets to the result that it gets to.</text>

            <text syncTime="3181.399" offset="12858162">Mr. Tigar, your opponent says that claims have been raised in Texas now since Penry that being a sociopath is in effect a mitigating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.335" offset="12897972">If you prevail here, do you think that would have to be regarded as a mitigating evidence?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael E. Tigar</label>
            <text syncTime="3196.339" offset="12917930">Of course not, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.160" offset="12925244">Of course not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.102" offset="12929006">I mean, this Court said in Eddings how this is to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.543" offset="12946769">There are these constitutionally mitigating factors, and then there's an assessment of the evidence standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.287" offset="12969757">The opinion for the Court in Boyde v. California should teach anyone foolhardy enough to come up here what's going to happen to them if they make an argument of that kind, so I don't think that the Court needs to worry about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.086" offset="13029003">The problem is that, of course, the Court of Criminal Appeals will decide those cases and presumably the Court won't... won't want to hear them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.043" offset="13060767">The problem with the Court of Criminal Appeals in this Black case is that at page 364 they say, unless your name is Penry and you took the same IQ test, what they say we will not retreat means no additional jury instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.973" offset="13120536">It's futile to ask for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.413" offset="13126283">No procedural bar.</text>

            <text syncTime="3249.795" offset="13131821">Well, it could be that mental retardation is such a... so likely in every case to affect somebody's control that you just have a per se rule about it that you have to have a separate instruction, but just being useful, maybe it ought to be decided on a case-to-case basis, which arguably, at least Texas argues, is amply taken care of in issue 1.</text>

            <text syncTime="3290.942" offset="13296392">Well, they promised in Jurek they were going to do it and then they didn't, and that, it seems to me, is the difference between the facial and as-applied challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.017" offset="13332650">To look at it more broadly, in Stanford v. Kentucky the Court wrote an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.088" offset="13348950">You counted the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.250" offset="13353652">You looked at the 29 States that said, let's put youth in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.272" offset="13369744">29 is surely more of a constitutional consensus than that found inadequate in Stanford and yet not quite so much as the one you had in Coker, so I think that it's a fair question whether you have to say youth or whether under one of these catch-all statutes it would be adequate to those purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.364" offset="13442051">And the final observation I would make is that we are told that mitigating evidence didn't take up very many pages in the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.051" offset="13480816">The Fifth Circuit accepted it for what it was, so that issue has been resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.064" offset="13496908">The hearsay point, I wonder where trial counsel for the State was, or for the district attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.218" offset="13521463">It wasn't objected to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.467" offset="13526479">The point about youth is that it only takes a word in the transcript... he's 17... and the evocative power of it in our law life for 2,200 years of recorded legal history has been enough for sentencers to say, oh, he is?</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.719" offset="13595442">That's mitigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.422" offset="13602338">And that, if the Court please, is our respectful submission.</text>
