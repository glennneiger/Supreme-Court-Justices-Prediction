            <text syncTime="61.303" offset="380987">This Court has repeatedly held in conformance with common law that absolute immunity to public officials is exceedingly rare under section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.540" offset="429993">This case presents the question of whether prosecutors who direct and participate in a yearlong prearrest and preindictment investigation, who participate in manufacturing bootprint evidence, in interrogating witnesses, and in conducting a prejudicial publicity campaign, which includes a postindictment press conference which strayed far beyond the announcement of that particular indictment, whether those particular functions and acts by a prosecutor should be afforded such immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.525" offset="589862">Common law, public policy, and this Court's prior decisions in Imbler, in Burns, and also in Harlow particularly dictate that such absolute prosecutorial immunity should not be afforded for these particular acts of these respondents.</text>

            <text syncTime="159.136" offset="772301">In terms of the acts that I just outlined, it would not in any way cause a limitation on the holding in Imbler.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.420" offset="801454">Common law, with regard to this particular set of acts and prosecutors and quasi-judicial immunity does not support the grant of absolute immunity here.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.373" offset="877314">Narrowly, you look at these acts and you see whether common law prior to and at 1871, which is, of course, when the statute was passed, when we have to look at it, that there was no exception for prosecutors or anyone else for these kinds of acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="449.956" offset="1935586">However, if it does, we're confident that the Court would find that we do... have made several interrelated claims not only with regard to the investigative acts, such as the fabrication of the bootprint evidence and the coercive statements, but also with regard to the prejudicial publicity claim that the Government has challenged.</text>

            <text syncTime="1644.690" offset="6714532">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.414" offset="6741490">I would like to begin by focusing on the prosecutor's participation in acts which occurred prior to the indictment, specifically in terms of interrogations and the selection of expert witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.353" offset="6789242">I'd like to conclude by discussing the petitioner's unfair trial claim against Prosecutor Fitzsimmons arising from the announcement of his criminal indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.158" offset="6820484">Your Honors, we simply ask the Court to apply a rule which immunizes, accords absolute immunity to prosecutors who are accused of engaging in out-of-court investigation which culminates in constitutional wrongs only as a result of the decision to prosecute and to present evidence to judicial bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.721" offset="6898643">We acknowledge that in other cases investigative conduct is amply protected by the protections of qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.524" offset="6925914">We believe that the distinction can be drawn in a given case, in particular in this case, by simply focusing on the prosecutorial function to be inhibited or deterred if the suit is allowed to proceed and immunity is withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.843" offset="6975129">Applying that test to this case reveals quite readily that the petitioner's claims arising from the investigation are solely based upon the prosecutor's decision to present testimony to the grand jury and again at the petitioner's criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.162" offset="7032494">He has conceded that the only claims he has are... occurred as a result of those decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.839" offset="7079201">Mr. Sotos, do you draw a distinction between, case one, the prosecutor fabricates evidence by filing the firing pin on the pistol and it gets... and then he introduces it; case two, it isn't the prosecutor that does it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.323" offset="7149105">You'd say in case one that he's immune.</text>

            <text syncTime="1763.599" offset="7190169">It's the arresting officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.051" offset="7196021">He has a grudge against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.410" offset="7209395">So, he fabricates it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.872" offset="7215247">The prosecutor, either way, either innocently or knowing of the fabrication, introduces it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.797" offset="7247012">Is the arresting officer immune?</text>

            <text syncTime="1780.050" offset="7255998">The arresting officer would not be immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.891" offset="7263416">There would be a distinction in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.252" offset="7272821">We are not claiming that the prosecutor again has immunity for the act of manufacturing the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.087" offset="7300197">It is his decision to introduce the evidence into the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.788" offset="7314930">Now, under this Court's functional approach, it's often said that we have to focus on the act and not the actor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.744" offset="7338754">And that's true, but it can be misleading because the key to the functional approach really is to focus on the nature of the prosecutorial function to be deterred if the suit is allowed to proceed.</text>

          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1811.199" stopTime="1824.287">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="1811.199" offset="7380550">Well, but there are two acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.341" offset="7385147">There's the act of introduction, and there's the act of fabrication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.303" offset="7397059">Just as you can get the arresting officer separately for that separate act, why shouldn't you be able to get the prosecutor separately for that separate act?</text>

          <turn speaker="james_g_sotos" startTime="1824.287" stopTime="1911.776">
            <label>Mr. James G. Sotos</label>
            <text syncTime="1824.287" offset="7432899">Because the prosecutor has to be protected from exposure to liability in that earlier act to the extent that he would be inhibited in terms of introducing that information into the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.114" offset="7472292">This Court actually addressed that distinction in Malley where the police officer sought to analogize his position in seeking an arrest warrant to a prosecutor's efforts to obtaining a warrant... to obtain an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.263" offset="7520879">This Court specifically rejected that analogy and stated that to expose the prosecutor to liability for even the initial phase of his prosecutorial work could interfere with his exercise of independent judgment at every phase of his work so that the prosecutor might come to see later decisions in terms of their effect on his potential liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.646" offset="7602381">So, again, under the functional approach, you look at the... the prosecutor exercises the functions that are essential to the operation of the criminal judicial process, the decision to prosecute, the decision to introduce testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.334" offset="7649088">And to the extent that liability on a claim that may have initially arose as a result of his involvement in the investigative process would impact on those decisions, the immunity has to apply to that claim as opposed to just focusing on the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.863" offset="7703214">If you simply focus on the preparatory act, then you run the risk of turning Imbler into a pleading rule which could be circumvented in every instance if a criminal defendant simply focuses on a preparatory act and uses that as the linchpin or the hook upon which to relitigate the criminal prosecution, which we believe is exactly what's happening here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1911.776" offset="7782940">Mr. Sotos, what if what we have was the prosecutor manufacturing the evidence and obtaining an arrest warrant, the prosecution is later dismissed, but the defendant is arrested?</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.675" offset="7846470">Now, what kind of immunity does the prosecutor have--</text>

            <text syncTime="1930.926" offset="7859531">Under Burns v. Reed, the prosecutor would only be entitled to qualified immunity under that scenario.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.491" offset="7877816">That function of participating in seeking an arrest is not so intimately associated with the prosecutor's decision to prosecute that it would be entitled to the rarer protection of absolute immunity.</text>

            <label>Mr. James G. Sotos</label>
            <text syncTime="1960.208" offset="7976664">--We believe that's the reason that the petitioner's false arrest claim should not be permitted to circumvent absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.980" offset="7999756">Typically if the prosecutor again is participating in seeking an arrest warrant outside the grand jury, there would be no immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.305" offset="8029013">But again, under Illinois law, the judiciary is required to issue an arrest warrant immediately upon the return of an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.870" offset="8055240">And we know from several cases that a prosecutor is absolutely immune for his actions before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.333" offset="8077183">So, to the extent that the false arrest claim could be allowed to circumvent immunity in this case, again Imbler would just be turned into a pleading rule because in every case where a criminal defendant was indicted, he would simply sue the prosecutor for false arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2029.753" offset="8254816">So, we would claim only the qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.434" offset="8265578">The prosecutor would only be qualified immunity under that scenario.</text>

            <text syncTime="2045.682" offset="8318554">You see, again, the difference between that scenario and what we have here is that the petitioner seeks to use the announcement of the criminal indictment as a way to litigate an unfair trial claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.799" offset="8358992">And it's our position that in the same way that this Court has given prosecutors absolute immunity from malicious prosecution claims, regardless of what the triggering act is, it's that claim that he's immune from because it by nature targets the decision to indict in the same way an unfair trial claim by nature targets the prosecutor's conduct of the criminal trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2093.121" offset="8508308">Because to properly apply the functional approach, Justice White, the Court should focus on the entire claim, not just the act because, again, that runs the risk of Imbler being a pleading rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.491" offset="8549790">And this claim is two-dimensional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.421" offset="8557523">There's a claim that the press conference deprived him of a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.973" offset="8571733">Now, we concede that with respect to the press conference, that that's an administrative act for which the prosecutor would typically only be entitled to administrative immunity under Justice Kennedy's hypothetical concerning a loss of job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.834" offset="8623142">But in order to prove this claim, he has to show that he was deprived of a fair trial, and to expose the prosecutor to an unfair trial claim... by illustration, if that prosecutor was wrestling with the decision of whether to go forward and present the case to the jury, if he was denied immunity on this type of claim, his thinking would be something like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.525" offset="8701927">If I don't go forward, I can't be sued because I haven't done anything to this point to violate anyone's constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.152" offset="8732438">But if I do go forward with this case and I don't get a conviction or if the case ends in a hung jury, then I can be sued for deprivation of a fair trial if the petitioner uses the announcement of the press conference as the linchpin on which to achieve the relitigation of the criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.872" offset="8799312">And, Justice, I think I can give you a more specific example of how allowing this type of claim to go forward would interfere with the--</text>

            <text syncTime="2203.026" offset="8947896">In a high profile, highly charged case like this, a criminal defendant's motion to transfer venue is a typical and a common occurrence in a criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.793" offset="8986976">At the time that motion is made, that prosecutor has to decide whether to oppose that motion or to concede to a transfer to a different venue, and that decision is supposed to be made based upon his independent evaluation as to the extent to which the publicity has infected the trial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.732" offset="9054685">If immunity were withheld, when the prosecutor was sitting down to make that decision, he would be more inclined to just concede to a transfer because of a fear that if he successfully opposed the motion, but didn't win the trial, that he could be sued for deprivation of a fair trial for opposing the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.719" offset="9142665">And when you really look at this claim, that's what the petitioner is doing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.578" offset="9158130">He's suing the prosecutor for opposing his motion to transfer venue at the criminal trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2569.755" offset="10414829">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.446" offset="10469581">I would like to turn first to petitioner's contention that the prosecutors are subject to a section 1983 damages action based on the preindictment activities, such as evaluation of the evidence and selection of expert witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.013" offset="10523812">This Court's decision in Imbler squarely holds that a prosecutor is immune for actions taken in initiating a prosecution and in presenting the State's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.050" offset="10564040">The prosecutor's preindictment actions in evaluating the evidence is part of that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.594" offset="10586192">Indeed, his evaluation is an essential step in determining whether to bring a prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.087" offset="10608135">It follows that a prosecutor cannot be sued on the basis of his review of the evidence and selection of expert witnesses where the only injury the plaintiff alleges is the commencement of a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.403" offset="10649408">At bottom, the issue here does not differ at all, or at least in no significant respect, from the issue in Imbler.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.047" offset="10675949">The petitioner seeks damages for what he alleges was a wrongful prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.392" offset="10693398">Petitioner attempts to distinguish his suit by characterizing his claim as a challenge to the prosecutor's investigation, but he does not allege that this investigation injured him in any way apart from what happened in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.691" offset="10750554">Imbler, accordingly, bars his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.313" offset="10761003">As the court of appeals put it, it would be a hoax to proclaim immunity for presentation of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.916" offset="10783469">In court the person aggrieved by that testimony may attack its preparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.768" offset="10802904">Immunity is not limited to unprepared events at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.849" offset="10815234">Yet, that is exactly the result that petitioner urges here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.332" offset="10829131">Indeed, the plaintiff in Imbler made very similar claims with respect to the prosecutor's preparation of his case in that particular instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.859" offset="10867270">This Court, nevertheless, held that the prosecutor was immune in Imbler.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.501" offset="10885764">The court of appeals was also correct in concluding that the former prosecutor Fitzsimmons is not subject to suit for his out-of-court public statements that allegedly injured petitioner in the subsequent criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.532" offset="10941980">We will not characterize that issue, however, as a matter of absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.154" offset="10960370">Petitioner's suit is defective because it fails to state a cognizable section 1983 claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.508" offset="10981790">Taking petitioner's factual allegations as true, Fitzsimmons' public statements did not, as a matter of law, deprive petitioner of any constitutional right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2878.067" offset="11648122">Now, turning to what actually happened in this case, Fitzsimmons' statements plainly provide no basis for petitioner's Fourth Amendment claim because the grand jury indicted petitioner prior to the press conference, and the indictment itself provided probable cause for the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.280" offset="11712905">Second, Fitzsimmons' statements cannot support petitioner's defamation claim because, as this Court has repeatedly held, mere injury to reputation by itself does not amount to a constitutional injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.375" offset="11753343">With respect to Fitzsimmons' statements and how they affected the claim relating to pretrial release, petitioner, to be sure, has a liberty interest in freedom from confinement, but his interest is invaded only if he is detained without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.388" offset="11821366">Here an Illinois court detained petitioner pursuant to Illinois bail law, and petitioner has not alleged that the Illinois court's bail decision violated the due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2985.869" offset="12079247">The jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict, and the resulting mistrial did not curtail petitioner's liberty interest in any constitutional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.963" offset="12107668">In any event, petitioner again cannot state a due process claim against anyone without a colorable challenge to the Illinois procedures, such as voir dire and change of venue rules, that are available to prevent prejudice from pretrial publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.252" offset="12160853">Petitioner has made no claim that the Illinois procedures are defective, and as a result, he has failed to satisfy the requirements for stating a due process claim.</text>

            <label>Mr. George F. Taylor, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3027.737" offset="12246744">When the question of two prosecutors, or police doing the act rather than the prosecutor, comes up in both of the contexts of both the manufacture of the evidence, the interrogation of the witnesses, and the prejudicial publicity, we see the basic fallacy of their argument because what they're doing here and what the court of appeals is doing is... has a premise and a principle which extends prosecutorial immunity to all those kinds of actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.591" offset="12390208">And that is the premise that's faulty here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.283" offset="12400971">Now, the court of appeals... he says that he... excuse me... the Government says that they agree with the court of appeals decision in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.517" offset="12433885">Well, they can't agree with it in part in terms of the injury analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.480" offset="12449767">They're saying that they're conceding that it's only qualified immunity for the press conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.264" offset="12472860">Well, but they're saying that it's absolute immunity with regard to the other, the manufacture of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.337" offset="12501176">Well, both of those are premised on the idea that the injury happened within the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.721" offset="12522701">That's what Judge Easterbrook premised his analysis on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.123" offset="12536285">So, if you... you have to see absolute immunity for both or absolute immunity for neither.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.637" offset="12558332">The Government's argument is completely inconsistent on that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.061" offset="12576096">And it also shows the basic mistake of that court of appeals decision, that its overreaching nature of looking at the injury rather than the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.807" offset="12626982">And that is the basic mistake of that decision, and that's how it distorts Imbler and allows one to ignore the holding there which the... is that the act has to be intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.171" offset="12696468">And that is why we say that the Seventh Circuit was in error and that, in fact, qualified immunity should be afforded here rather than absolute immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3152.958" offset="12747668">Mr. Taylor, I thought that the concession of qualified immunity liability with respect to the press conference was a concession of qualified immunity as to injuries other than the injuries that are produced through the trial, that is, qualified immunity for any libel.</text>

            <text syncTime="3172.662" offset="12826453">That's not the way they stated it in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.553" offset="12842022">They stated it in an absolute way both in their summary of argument and in their argument itself that it's not a question of absolute immunity, and I think they say specifically that it's because it's not intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.712" offset="12898656">And so, in that sense, that concession... they may not... they may have backed up from it a bit after we filed our reply brief, but it is clear what that concession entails in the... in their original amicus brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.633" offset="12958319">And I... their statement that it was passed on by the court of appeals is... borders on the ridiculous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.148" offset="12988412">If you go and look at those pages, the court of appeals, as far as it extended immunity, was not dealing with constitutional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.314" offset="13017043">It was never an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.334" offset="13025088">The defendants have never raised it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.017" offset="13031880">They have... they still concede that, in fact, there were constitutional violations alleged here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.021" offset="13055913">The court did not need to reach it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.771" offset="13062914">It wasn't briefed, and it wasn't argued, and it wasn't decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.135" offset="13080363">And if you look most recently at this Court's decision in Bray v. Alexandria, it was a very similar situation where the respondent wanted to argue an additional claim on reargument I believe, and this Court rejected that because of those factors.</text>
