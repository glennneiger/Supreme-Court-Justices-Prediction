            <text syncTime="1271.009" offset="5218808">So it was not an instance in which because of B&amp;W's conduct the fellow members of the oligopolist would ruin their 50 years of supracompetitive pricing by starting to lower their regular-brand prices.</text>

            <text syncTime="1408.610" offset="5769260">If there is a violation... the reason we find a violation is because there is injury to the rival which will ultimately redound to the injury of consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.229" offset="5819729">I mean that's why we have a rule against predatory pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.274" offset="5827879">So if there is a violation, then the plaintiff's injury flows from the reason for finding the violation, and therefore there is antitrust injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.662" offset="5861420">The principal issue in the case, if I haven't emphasized it enough, is that there was a jury verdict below.</text>

            <text syncTime="1655.557" offset="6757002">And... and furthermore, they relied heavily upon the document called the final proposal that Brown &amp; Williamson made to its parent corporation just before entering generics, after Doral had been introduced by RJR.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.956" offset="6826593">And, indeed, that final proposal is a crucial document here, and I think they were quite correct to rely upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.110" offset="6851252">But I wanted to meet first the assertion that there is a jury verdict here which must be respected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.388" offset="6876330">The facts here are such that even if the jury had answered special interrogatories finding all of the things that Liggett says they found, I think j.n.o.v. would have been proper because there are no facts to back up... there would be no facts to back up such a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.850" offset="6946233">But in fact, as we've said in our brief and I won't dwell upon it at length, these instructions the judge gave clearly permit the jury to find liability solely on the basis of the intent of bad intent, generalized bad intent in Brown &amp; Williamson documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.045" offset="7034945">And, indeed, that's what Liggett argued to the judge, that bad intent plus injury to Liggett was enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="1768.871" offset="7210279">The point I'm making here is you can infer nothing from the jury verdict because of the instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.430" offset="7232535">That is the jury was given an impermissible route to find B&amp;W liable, and that route was simply aggressive or bad statements in pre-Doral documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.910" offset="7278406">And instructions 16, 18, and 29 clearly offer the jury that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.000" offset="7306828">And moreover, when the jury, on the eighth day of its deliberations, said the written instructions it had before were kind of confusing and it needed help on the question of competitive injury, the judge gave an off-the-cuff oral statement in which he stressed bad intent and a generic submarket, which, of course, he later said shouldn't have been in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.881" offset="7402331">So that it seems to me almost probable that the jury found B&amp;W guilty for some aggressive statements in its documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.673" offset="7449456">We had a... we requested instruction that we had to sell below cost, intend to sell below cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.733" offset="7477773">The judge agreed, but didn't give... and the jury could have found, if you look at those instructions, that B&amp;W is liable on the basis of pre-Doral bad statements in documents, without finding any oligopolistic coordination, without finding any below cost pricing, without finding any prospect of recoupment, and in reliance on a nonexistent generic submarket.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.036" offset="7586965">But let me get on to the... the merits of the case, because I said that there's... the jury verdict really tells us nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.764" offset="7637851">And, in fact, the case should be reversed for that reason alone, because a jury which is allowed to find liability solely on bad intent, I think has just... I think that violates this court's ruling in Spectrum Sports.</text>

            <text syncTime="1976.145" offset="8039406">But I wanted to get onto the theories of injury from price discrimination here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.315" offset="8068036">I think Professor Areeda said that using price discrimination facilitates predation because the predator doesn't have to spend as much money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.684" offset="8113593">It is also true that the alleged victim doesn't have to spend as much money, so the price discrimination facilitates resistance to predation in the same amounts as it facilitates the predation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.492" offset="8168764">There is simply no injury here from price discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.974" offset="8186736">But this case, I think it is profitable to compare it to Matsushita because this case, our case, Brown &amp; Williamson's case, satisfies both the majority rationale in that case and the dissent's rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.451" offset="8256640">The economic theory here is utterly implausible and, in addition, the facts refute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.588" offset="8289136">Unlike Matsushita, there was here no expert witness talking from facts of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.787" offset="8321946">The expert witness here was an advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.350" offset="8332186">He stated the facts sometimes in contradiction to Liggett's executives, and he... the facts he assumed have no basis in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.690" offset="8377535">Also unlike Matsushita, this is not a summary judgment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.079" offset="8391118">The district court here let this case go to trial, heard all of the evidence, reread it for 5 months, and then wrote a very thoughtful j.n.o.v. opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.183" offset="8435526">So that I think primarily both courts below rested upon factual determinations that there's simply, even favorably viewed to Liggett, no substantial evidence to back up their case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2168.661" offset="8809495">And if you take a look at the final proposal... that is Liggett put in evidence the document that destroys its own case... you will not find before the final proposal any plan to do all the things Liggett says B&amp;W planned to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.152" offset="8899461">It's expressed nowhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.525" offset="8904895">In the final proposal itself, which is at Appendix 127, every one of Liggett's claims about our plans is contradicted, and this is the last planning document there is before we went in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.895" offset="8966335">For example, Liggett says we were going to save $350 million of lost branded profits by attacking them in generics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.016" offset="9010847">If you'll look at the final proposal, Brown &amp; Williamson is saying that it's going to lose $350 million to generics, without relation to anything that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.635" offset="9061316">And it proposes entering generics not to discipline Liggett, there's not a word of that... entering generics to make some profits in generics to replace some of the profits it's losing on brandeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.131" offset="9111366">Now, the proposal also states that given RJR's repricing of Doral as a generic... and RJR, of course, is one of the industry giants... there is no reason for B&amp;W to be concerned about expanding the generic... generic segment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.654" offset="9185450">The segment is going to expand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.263" offset="9191824">It also states in that proposal that RJR has shown its willingness to accept low Doral prices indefinitely, which is hardly a sign that they expect somebody to manage prices up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.429" offset="9252532">They said the economy or generic segment of the market is established and will be a major part of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.222" offset="9283670">The proposal assumes that the current percentage gap between generic and full price cigarette prices is at 35 percent and will continue throughout the 5-year planning period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.763" offset="9341871">It assumes... it speculates as to what other companies will do, and they will have differing responses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.448" offset="9372591">There is some speculation that some of them might try to manage prices up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.805" offset="9390041">That's the ordinary thing, you try to think about your competitors and what they might do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.835" offset="9410103">But the document recognized that RJR was willing to accept low prices on Doral indefinitely and predicted that the 35 percent price gap would continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.392" offset="9456392">So when that document, which is the crucial document in this case... and which the Fourth Circuit emphasized because, as the Fourth Circuit said, Liggett heavily relied upon this document.</text>

            <text syncTime="2424.558" offset="9833077">There can be no doubt that Brown &amp; Williamson intended to expand the generic segment when it entered it, because it is undisputed that Brown &amp; Williamson offered black-and-white cigarettes to 1,000 wholesalers who had never carried them before.</text>

            <text syncTime="2971.840" offset="12022139">This is Liggett's chart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.400" offset="12056411">And Liggett has been saying that in December 1983 the gap stood at 40... or almost 41 percent, and it came down to just about 27 percent by June of '89.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.360" offset="12120255">If you look at the chart, they have chosen the two most extreme figures there are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.750" offset="12141779">And if you come along, start from... in May 1980, the top left, when Liggett was alone in the field the gap was 29.9, it dropped about a point in November and then it began rising.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.289" offset="12215967">So the gap rose and it stayed above... it stayed above where it was in 1980 up until June of 1989.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.220" offset="12271660">So if we were narrowing the gap, we did a very poor job of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.640" offset="12289319">We didn't narrow the gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.594" offset="12293185">Also, notice the prices there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.576" offset="12309068">Liggett was raising prices steadily from the beginning of the generics, from 1980, up through the period when we entered.</text>

            <text syncTime="3070.253" offset="12415856">And there's one other thing about this chart.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.519" offset="12420872">Liggett has compared only its black-and-whites with generic... with brandeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.078" offset="12439157">Philip Morris and RJR were selling black-and-whites by the time of the trial at over 50 percent off the price of brandeds, some narrowing of the gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.575" offset="12477087">Moreover, Liggett doesn't mention that it was selling a branded generic, Pyramid, at 50 percent off the price of brandeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.243" offset="12515748">So there was no plan to narrow the gap and there was no narrowing of the gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.303" offset="12532049">The gap fluctuated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.069" offset="12539050">That's about all I can say, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.222" offset="12563709">The fact is the district court specifically found, at page 36a of the petition,</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.062" offset="12595056">"No substantial record evidence supports Burnett's alignment of interest theory. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.857" offset="12614282">that's the oligopolistic theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.404" offset="12620447">"Even before B&amp;W began selling black-and-white cigarettes, RJR had entered the generic segment by repositioning Doral at generic prices. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.494" offset="12660780">"Burnett conceded that RJR had no anticompetitive intent and that Doral's entry expanded the generic segment. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.100" offset="12691187">The court noted that they tried to sell a lot of cigarettes to replace Philip Morris as number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.660" offset="12709473">Furthermore, the court said there is no evidence that any of the other major cigarette companies had an interest in slowing the growth of generics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.531" offset="12744895">Then five of the six companies sold generics, today all six do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.186" offset="12763598">We started with 2.8 billion cigarettes being sold in generics, that jumped to 80 billion, and today it's about twice that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.635" offset="12805394">So there's been no slowing of the growth of generics, but rather quite the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.523" offset="12832875">This is a lawsuit by one full-line competitor against another full-line competitor, both of whom were profitable throughout the period of predation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.629" offset="12873313">And I think the only inference one can draw, after looking at the facts and seeing that there was no plan to do what Liggett accuses us of and that no such things happened in the market, is that this was a lawsuit designed initially just to keep Brown &amp; Williamson out of black-and-white cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.074" offset="12947082">You have to be very careful with a lawsuit like this, because there's potential for--</text>

            <text syncTime="3236.106" offset="13079262">One was the 12 percent market share of Brown &amp; Williams, on which the court built its theoretical suspicions, and the other was the growth of the generic sector, which the court below thought confirmed its theoretical suspicions.</text>
