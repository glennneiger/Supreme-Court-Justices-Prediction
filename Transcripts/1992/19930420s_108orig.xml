            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="5.384" offset="103300">The first of these is Nebraska versus Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.593" offset="124093">It is an original action concerning interstate water rights to the North Platte River.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.058" offset="153977">That River rises is in Colorado and flaws northward through Wyoming and to Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.279" offset="178846">In 1945, this Court entered a decree establishing certain interstate priorities on the North Platte.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.984" offset="209671">The Court equitably apportioned between Wyoming and Nebraska the waters in a 40-mile stretch known as the "pivotal reach".</text>
            <text syncTime="41.454" offset="247496">In 1986, Nebraska came back to this Court seeking enforcement of that 1945 decree and seeking injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.636" offset="288247">We granted Nebraska the lead to file its petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.590" offset="304129">Wyoming counterclaimed Colorado and the United States, United States which operates several reservoirs and canals on the river were made parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.175" offset="346448">We referred the matter to a Special Master, Master Owen Olpin who was managed the litigations since 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.587" offset="380093">And before us now are the Special Master's recommended dispositions of several summary judgment motions together with the exceptions filed to the Special Master's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.186" offset="430457">For reasons explained in an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we agree with the Special Master's recommendations and we overrule the exceptions to those recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.935" offset="481448">Summary judgment is granted to Nebraska and the United States on the question of the priority of the Inland Lakes in Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.990" offset="513631">We agree with the Master that a 1904 priority date was determined in the 1945 proceedings and that Wyoming's post decree acquiescence in administration of the lakes precludes that from challenging that priority now.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.050" offset="577893">Neither Wyoming nor Nebraska is entitled to summary judgment on the issues, concerning Wyoming's construction of new storage and diversion facilities on two North Platte tributaries, Deer Creek and the Laramie River.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.587" offset="636093">We agree with the Master that further proceedings are warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.863" offset="653125">Because the Court did not establish rights to the disputed tributary waters in 1945, however, we note that injunctive relief would constitute a modification of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.521" offset="703803">To prevail therefore, Nebraska must make a showing that the new projects will cause Nebraska's substantial injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.781" offset="732851">Finally, we deny the parties request for several rulings with respect to the water rights of users below the Tri-State Dam in Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.285" offset="766915">Most of these issues are insufficiently developed to lend themselves to a summary judgment at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.736" offset="792619">We do, however, grant Nebraska partial summary judgment on its request for a determination that the 1945 decree does not impose absolute ceilings on the amount of water that canals in the pivotal reach may divert.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.773" offset="852805">The Court is uninamous.</text>
