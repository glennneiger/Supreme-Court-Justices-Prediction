            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="136237">We'll hear argument now in Number 91-1393, A.L. Lockhart v. Bobby Ray Fretwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.939" offset="175943">General Bryant.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="winston_bryant" startTime="12.308" stopTime="200.731">
            <label>Mr. Winston Bryant</label>
            <text syncTime="12.308" offset="185452">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.176" offset="196841">The petitioner believes the general issue in this case to be whether counsel for Mr. Fretwell was ineffective under the Sixth Amendment when he failed to raise a double-counting issue that may have benefited him at the time of the trial but which has subsequently been shown by a decision of this Court to be without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.541" offset="290359">I would like to recite a few of the facts in this case, because their order is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.112" offset="316586">In April of 1985, Fretwell lied in wait, entered the home of the victim, stole his money at gunpoint, and shot the victim in the head and killed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.587" offset="366533">Fretwell and two companions fled in the victim's pickup truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.455" offset="381997">Fretwell was tried in August of 1985, and the jury convicted him of capital felony murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.310" offset="409373">The case was bifurcated into a guilt-innocence phase and a penalty phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.048" offset="432361">After conviction, the court instructed the jury on two aggravating circumstances: 1) murder committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing an arrest, and 2) murder committed for pecuniary gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.558" offset="490457">The jury found only murder for pecuniary gain as an aggravating circumstance, and found no mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.812" offset="523476">Fretwell's counsel failed to object to the submission of pecuniary gain to the jury despite the fact that the Eighth Circuit had handed down Collins v. Lockhart in January of the same year, in 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.923" offset="587842">Collins held that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the use of pecuniary gain as an aggravating circumstance in capital felony murder trials where murder... where robbery-murder is the capital offense at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.366" offset="653670">Fretwell then appealed his conviction to the Arkansas Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.337" offset="669553">The issue of double counting was raised, but the court, the supreme court, decided... declined to decide the issue because it had not been raised at the trial level.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.894" offset="719813">Then in April of '87 the Arkansas Supreme Court denied Fretwell's application for post-judgment relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.850" offset="755548">Then in May of that year, 1987, he filed a habeas petition in Federal district court claiming ineffective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.308" offset="797448">Now, in January of 1988, shortly after he filed his habeas petition, this Court handed down Lowenfield v. Phelps.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.664" offset="838826">Lowenfield held that a death sentence does not violate the Eighth Amendment simply because an aggravating circumstance found by the jury duplicated an element of the underlying criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.356" offset="901625">To pass constitutional muster, a capital sentencing scheme must genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="200.731" stopTime="219.026">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="200.731" offset="939137">General Bryant, the question you present in your petition for certiorari seems to me to assume that the Collins case was properly overruled by the Eighth Circuit on the basis of Lowenfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.539" offset="990337">I don't see that we have here any issue as to whether that overruling was correct or not.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="winston_bryant" startTime="219.026" stopTime="341.555">
            <label>Mr. Winston Bryant</label>
            <text syncTime="219.026" offset="1012279">That is correct, Chief Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.828" offset="1023460">It was overruled by the Perry case... well, actually, the Lowenfield case prior to the Perry case... but the issue before this Court in the opinion of the State is whether or not the ineffective assistance of counsel claim under the Sixth Amendment has been met, and the State's position is that when Lowenfield was decided it was based on a decision by this Court in Jurek v. Texas, decided in 1976, and therefore was not new law that applied to the Fretwell situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.222" offset="1193047">After Lowenfield was decided, the Eighth Circuit in the Perry case, Perry v. Lockhart, which overruled Collins, specifically considered the death sentencing scheme in Arkansas and said that it was not indistinguishable from that in the Lowenfield decision, which talked about the death penalty sentencing scheme in the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.122" offset="1296701">But after that, the Federal district court in Little Rock issued a decision and rejected all claims that Fretwell had made in his habeas petition, except to the extent that the court found that the was ineffective assistance of counsel because the pecuniary gain as an aggravating circumstance had not been objected to at the trial court level, and then the district court directed that Mr. Fretwell either be resentenced or his conviction reduced to life without parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.478" offset="1442046">And then in September of 1991 the Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision with one exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.918" offset="1475901">They directed that Mr. Fretwell's sentence be reduced to life without parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.222" offset="1501083">So--</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="341.555" offset="1502441">Well, just to follow up on the question by the Chief Justice, is it open to the respondent to argue that the Eighth Circuit case, Collins, improperly... was improperly overruled, that it was right all the time?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="winston_bryant" startTime="359.699" stopTime="364.301">

            <text syncTime="365.587" offset="1598572">--The issue is before the Court, the Collins decision, simply because that was the basis for Fretwell's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.074" offset="1624485">It's the position of the State that Collins was bad law at the time, and even if you do not accept that theory, under the Lowenfield decision it was overruled and under our concept, the prejudice prong of the Strickland test, the reviewing court must consider whether or not the prejudice occurred at the time of the reviewing... the reviewing court makes its decision, and not at the time the alleged errors of counsel were made.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="410.882" offset="1779757">Do you think that position is entirely consistent with Teague, that you generally look at the law at the time of trial, the legal rules?</text>

          <turn speaker="winston_bryant" startTime="418.905" stopTime="443.003">
            <label>Mr. Winston Bryant</label>
            <text syncTime="418.905" offset="1811835">It's our position that if you look at the performance prong of the Strickland test that you look at the alleged errors at the time they were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.081" offset="1868469">If you look at the prejudice prong of the Strickland test, it's our position that the reviewing court should look at it at the time the review is made.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="443.003" stopTime="468.320">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="443.003" offset="1908175">Would it be the same... would you give the same view if instead of being an overruling there had been a statutory change, say that an objection might have been proper at the time of trial and then by the time it gets to review and habeas corpus the legislature changes some rule and you no longer could make that objection?</text>
            <text syncTime="459.299" offset="1973377">Would the ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to make the objection also be judged, in your view, by the time after the legislation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="winston_bryant" startTime="468.320" stopTime="484.680">
            <label>Mr. Winston Bryant</label>
            <text syncTime="468.320" offset="2009426">Quite frankly, I have not considered that question, but I think that there would be... you could argue more forcefully for the ineffective assistance of counsel claim in that instance, because the legislative act would occur after the fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="484.680" offset="2074941">Well, your position is basically that the defendant shouldn't have a windfall, isn't it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Winston Bryant</label>
            <text syncTime="494.370" offset="2113706">And if... that is the reason why that we think the Eighth Circuit should be overruled, because the Eighth Circuit's decision really stops... when they consider the prejudice prong of the Strickland test, they stop at the time the alleged counsel's errors were made, and we think that is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.054" offset="2232407">We think the prejudice prong should be considered at the time of the reviewing court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.626" offset="2258738">In addition to that, the Eighth Circuit Court used as a basis for its decision the supremacy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.136" offset="2316730">In this particular case, the Eighth Circuit in the Fretwell decision held that the trial court should have followed Collins because Collins had been decided by the Eighth Circuit in January before the trial occurred in August.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.728" offset="2375140">Using the supremacy clause as a basis, the Eighth Circuit directed that the Arkansas Court should have followed Collins.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.716" offset="2407009">It's our position that the supremacy clause does not apply in this case, and in fact the great weight of authority is that the State courts are not bound to follow decisions of the lower Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.774" offset="2463329">They're co-equal parts of the judicial system, and so the Arkansas court was not bound to follow Collins.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.896" offset="2499796">And in fact, had the issue come up and the attorney for Fretwell had made an objection to the use of pecuniary gain as an aggravating circumstance, we think that the better rule for the court to have followed... the court would have been bound to have followed the Jurek v. Texas decision which was already on the books, and so for that reason we think that the decision by the Eighth Circuit is, quite frankly, incorrect in its applications.</text>

            <text syncTime="1250.888" offset="5139731">The second reason that respondent's claim fails is that the habeas corpus statute itself, 28 U.S.C. 2254(a), provides that a person is entitled to habeas relief only if he shows that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or of the laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.551" offset="5222382">Respondent could not make that showing, because as of the time that the court granted habeas relief, there was no constitutional defect in the procedures used to sentence him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2871.034" offset="11620293">The definition of the offense of capital felony murder in Arkansas is so broad that it brings in defendants who have a variety of mental states, as well as some who manifest no culpable mental state whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.674" offset="11670866">It's difficult to conceive of a broader class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.960" offset="11680061">If any mental state is described in Arkansas, and it can be argued that none is, it's contained in the language which states that the crime was committed under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.303" offset="11741396">This language doesn't say anything about what a defendant's mental state may have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.105" offset="11760622">The Louisiana statute, on the other hand, as well as Texas, described culpable mental states of specific intent and knowing and intentional respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.360" offset="11797612">It should be noted that in Arkansas the trial court provides no definition of that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.578" offset="11814539">Under the Arkansas model instructions for criminal law, there is no instruction which defines or narrows the statutory language at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.101" offset="11852573">The Court should also note that the same statutory language in Arkansas appears in our definition of the offense of first degree murder, which is a noncapital offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.124" offset="11888727">If, as the petitioner argues, that language is sufficient standing alone to warrant the imposition of the death penalty, then his position is inconsistent with that of the State legislature.</text>

State, the appellant, relying on Collins, asserted that he was denied due process and the Arkansas court in responding to that claim basically said that, as was the case with Louisiana's death penalty law which was considered in Lowenfield, the duplicative nature of Arkansas' statutory aggravating circumstances did not render appellant's sentencing infirm and the Constitution requires no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.243" offset="13969119">So the Arkansas court has considered the Lowenfield issue, the double-counting issue, and in addition to that the Eighth Circuit in Perry also approved the Arkansas capital sentencing scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.919" offset="14027842">In view of Lowenfield comparing the Arkansas statute with Louisiana statute as well as the Texas statute under Jurek, Arkansas does narrow those eligible for the death penalty at the guilt phase of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.178" offset="14088864">Reference has been made to Stringer v. Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.313" offset="14101403">That case is not applicable to our situation because Stringer v. Black involved an aggravating circumstance that was too broad and was not specific enough, and this Court said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.752" offset="14147169">We do not have a problem in Fretwell with an aggravating circumstance that is too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.989" offset="14168172">Quite the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.889" offset="14171724">I don't think there's ever been any allegation made that pecuniary gain is too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.012" offset="14196279">It is specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.095" offset="14204534">One other point that I would make is that, as Justice Souter pointed out, pecuniary gain in Arkansas is not a necessary element of the criminal offense of robbery.</text>

            <text syncTime="3535.057" offset="14276423">Yes, that has been held by the Arkansas Supreme Court in a number of decisions, which is pointed out in our reply brief, and so because of that, because it's only a motive, it's not necessary that pecuniary gain be proven, so in that regard it is not a duplicate element of the initial offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.755" offset="14375166">However, in the State's view that is not relevant anyway, because we do sufficiently narrow at the guilt phase, and that is all that is required under this Court's rulings in the past.</text>
