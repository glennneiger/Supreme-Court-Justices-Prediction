            <text syncTime="56.648" offset="350555">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="59.479" offset="361840">The issue in this case today is a single one, whether or not Mr. McNeil can have his day in court on the merits in the case he alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.855" offset="391410">His suit alleges experimentation for AIDS and hepatitis purposes without his consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.659" offset="414607">The Government answered agreeing that it had funded the research on male prisoners, but claims that the research was done on him voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.685" offset="450761">We believe the Court can answer the question presented in this case without reaching all of the many questions presented in the briefs in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.192" offset="488690">In particular, we believe the case can be answered on the argument that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure rule 15(d) means that he perfected his March, 1989 filing by the August, 1989 letter for filing that he sent to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.751" offset="554937">That appears in the Joint Appendix on page 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.402" offset="565595">The case is not about exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.174" offset="576671">Mr. McNeil clearly exhausted the Federal administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.749" offset="594957">Indeed, we think he at least exhausted it twice, but certainly he exhausted it once and got a letter from the Federal Government saying that he had a right to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.494" offset="629961">However, the case is rather complicated on its facts and I would like to run through a number of those major facts to show the events.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.960" offset="663815">The case began when he filed, in at least January of 1989, an administrative claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.504" offset="694013">In that same month, a letter was sent by the administrative agency saying that his administrative claim, which it was labeled, was being sent to a claims officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.052" offset="736227">And he was told that if the case was not settled, he would have to bring a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.144" offset="756498">In February of 1989, he received another letter from that same administrative agency, this letter saying that no records could be found to indicate that such experimentation had been conducted with the Federal Government being involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.404" offset="813549">After those two letters, Mr. McNeil believed, apparently, that he had an obligation to sue or his rights would be lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.809" offset="847195">He brought suit in March of 1989 and included with that suit a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.633" offset="874467">In 1989 in May--</text>

            <text syncTime="1685.353" offset="6865389">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.778" offset="6887123">We believe that the question in this case is resolved by the language of section 2675(a), which has received little attention thus far this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.292" offset="6925157">As the court of appeals found, that statute is plain and it is unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.218" offset="6944801">It states that a plaintiff may not institute an FTCA action unless he first files an administrative claim and that claim is finally denied by the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.292" offset="6985134">Petitioner failed to meet that condition and the district court was therefore correct to dismiss his complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.246" offset="7008958">Now, my colleague, Mr. Shoenberger, has made much of the August 7th letter to the court and the rule 15 he seeks to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.524" offset="7050023">Our position is that a prematurely filed complaint that is barred by the terms of section 2675(a) cannot be rescued by a supplemental pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.603" offset="7098401">To do so would be squarely inconsistent with the terms of an Act of Congress, something that rule 15 simply cannot authorize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.096" offset="7128390">Rule 15 does not speak in terms of permitting an action to be filed that otherwise could not be; it speaks in terms of correcting a defect in the original complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="1882.252" offset="7652929">--Well, a plaintiff who files a case prematurely, Your Honor, has disserved the court, in effect, and used its resources when he wasn't entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.267" offset="7685007">But this is somewhat beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.269" offset="7697023">I would on... just further on the August 7th letter, as I've said, I don't think that a rule 15 supplemental pleading argument would work, for the reason that it would be barred by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.728" offset="7746865">The letter also cannot be treated as a new complaint, we believe, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.254" offset="7769017">One, the terms of the letter, I think, are insufficient to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.496" offset="7781974">But more importantly for this Court's purposes, Mr. McNeil did not make that argument in the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.089" offset="7804334">And, in fact, the opinion of the court of appeals noted that he disclaimed that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.312" offset="7817187">Moreover, that argument simply was not presented in the question presented in the cert petition and, in fact, it's quite inconsistent with the question that petitioner presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.548" offset="7862117">It would be extraordinary to present a question on which the circuits are in conflict, that is directly inconsistent with an argument you wish later to make, to get the Court to grant certiorari, and then later seek reversal on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.106" offset="7908406">We don't believe that that argument is properly before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.597" offset="7918333">And in any event, it is far afield from the legal issue that has divided the circuits and on which we believe this Court's ruling is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.093" offset="7952292">Now, also without much mention in my colleague's argument was the Court's decision in Hallstrom against Tillamook County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.508" offset="7986042">There the Court concluded that the language of the statute at issue meant what it said, and we believe here, as well, the Court should enforce the terms of section 2675(a) as they are written.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.254" offset="8025017">And those terms simply do not permit a plaintiff to file an FTCA action unless he first complies with the administrative process and that process is completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.442" offset="8065768">Now, the rest of the FTCA confirms that that reading is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.925" offset="8083636">Section 2675(a) itself provides exceptions for certain kinds of pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.516" offset="8102026">Conspicuously absent from that are pleadings under rule 15(d), and we believe that the provision of some exceptions and not others should exclude the remaining exceptions that petitioner has sought to have this Court adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.446" offset="8157719">Similarly, the Westfall Act amendments in 1988 were enacted on the premise that section 2675(a) requires an action that is prematurely filed to be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.624" offset="8202441">Section 2679(d)(5) deals with the situation where the United States is substituted as the defendant in an action that is originally brought against a Government employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.240" offset="8244968">Rather than permitting the administrative claim process to be done away with, or rather than having the action stayed pending an administrative claim, the act extends the statute of limitations to permit a plaintiff to file an administrative claim after his cause of action is dismissed, and later to file a new cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.253" offset="8320932">So we think the FTCA as a whole confirms our reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.856" offset="8335352">Now, the Court should also not overlook the extent to which it is disruptive to the administrative process to file a lawsuit prematurely under the FTCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.284" offset="8385089">The administrative process is very valuable and very important... a great many cases are settled... and it would very much disrupt the system to permit plaintiffs to go to court prematurely and vitiate the effectiveness of that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.501" offset="8433990">As the Court stated in Hallstrom, positions become hardened once litigation is initiated, and settlement becomes less likely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.808" offset="8471188">More practically, FTCA cases for the Government are litigated typically by the U.S. Attorneys offices, and the administrative claims process is cut off by the filing of a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.094" offset="8516328">The statute itself provides that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.497" offset="8525941">Section 2672 gives the head of the concerned agency the authority to settle a case prior to litigation being filed, subject to regulations promulgated by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.415" offset="8573588">Section 2677 lodges that authority to settle in the Attorney General after a lawsuit is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.478" offset="8601905">It is entirely a separate process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.492" offset="8621967">An agency cannot, on its own, settle a case after a... after the lawsuit is filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2129.236" offset="8640880">Does that mean that at the time this man wrote his letter to the agency, the agency really didn't have any authority to settle?</text>

            <text syncTime="2136.559" offset="8670241">Well, on... these facts are somewhat unusual, Justice Stevens, because the agency did not have notice that the lawsuit had been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.054" offset="8696155">I suppose, as an abstract matter, that would be correct, although the Attorney General's regulations respecting settlement of administrative claims do not specifically state that they may not settle claims after a lawsuit is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.593" offset="8754356">The structure of the statute suggests that and in the administrative process the way it works, as a practical matter, is that once a case is filed and we know... typically, we're served when a complaint is filed; we were not here... the agency simply cannot do it by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.023" offset="8816109">But I don't believe that we would be forced to say that a settlement of this case administratively would have been unauthorized.</text>

            <text syncTime="2216.564" offset="8990189">And we believe, frankly, it is plain... it should be plain to a layperson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.715" offset="8998862">Mr. McNeil, as is reflected by his prose pleadings, is not someone who is completely unfamiliar with the legal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.369" offset="9025402">And I would actually have to say that he did a pretty good job as a prose litigant in terms of his pleadings; he cited the right statutes, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.934" offset="9063750">And he... he made a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.335" offset="9073259">Now, section 2678 of the statute, which deals with the extent of allowed attorneys fees in these cases, which is reprinted in the appendix to our brief, also confirms that there is a big difference between pre-litigation settlement and post-litigation settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.380" offset="9157477">Under that statute, a settlement pursuant to section 2672, that is the pre-litigation settlement by the agency, is... allows an attorney to collect a contingency fee of up to 25 percent of the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.139" offset="9220485">That section also says, however, that once a lawsuit is filed and a case is settled pursuant to section 2677, the percentage of the allowable attorneys fee is reduced to 20 percent, and that is a criminal penalty if a lawyer violates that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.928" offset="9275655">So this all goes to the point that it's important to have a bright line here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.113" offset="9292374">We believe that it is important to know when a lawsuit may be instituted and when one actually is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.047" offset="9324139">Petitioner offers no line, much less one that is clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="2322.423" offset="9413686">It's 25 percent if you go to court, and we don't think the difference between 20 percent, if you can settle out of court, and 25 percent is enough to encourage attorneys to go ahead and try to avoid the administrative process, as a practical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.181" offset="9468648">In this case, Judge Ripple quite clearly didn't understand, in the Seventh Circuit, that the August filing could be treated as a separate and new complaint.</text>
