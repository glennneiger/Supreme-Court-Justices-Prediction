            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="140633">We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 91-1326, the District of Columbia v. The Greater Washington Board of Trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.606" offset="183056">Ms. Murasky.</text>

            <label>Ms. Donna M. Murasky</label>
            <text syncTime="16.093" offset="204999">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.628" offset="215134">When State Workers Compensation laws were enacted beginning some 80 years ago, an active employee's compensation consisted principally if not exclusively of wages for hours worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.519" offset="258706">Times have changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.985" offset="264558">In recent years, an increasingly important component of an employee's compensation is comprised of benefits in lieu of higher wages, including health insurance benefits for employees and their families.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.493" offset="306563">In 1974, Congress recognized the importance of nonwage benefits when it enacted the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.516" offset="342612">In ERISA, Congress imposed a modest level of regulation on virtually all employers who provide nonwage benefits to employees, and it preempted State laws relating to such regulated plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.156" offset="397155">At the same time, however, Congress expressly declined to regulate employers insofar as they had benefit plans maintained solely to comply with State Workers Compensation unemployment compensation and disability insurance laws, and Congress allowed State regulation of such plans to continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.654" offset="471239">The issue in this case concerns the intersection of ERISA's preemption and Workers Compensation provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.308" offset="497779">The case arises because the District of Columbia amended its Workers Compensation law in 1990 to take into account modern compensation practices by providing some level of protection to employees and their families against a loss of health insurance when employees are killed or injured on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.352" offset="573952">The Equity Amendment Act requires all employers who provide health insurance benefits to their active workers to provide equivalent health insurance benefits for up to 52 weeks when their employees are eligible to receive Workers Compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.981" offset="636542">The court below ruled that although ERISA permits the States to require health insurance as part of Workers Compensation, ERISA does not permit the States to regulate those benefits in the usual Workers Compensation way by pegging them to benefits employees receive as active workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.442" offset="710311">The District of Columbia believes that this decision is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.910" offset="724209">It believes that the traditional loss replacement method it has adopted for determining health insurance benefits in its Workers Compensation law no more implicates the concerns of ERISA than with the freestanding law that the court below correctly ruled would clearly be permissible under this Court's decision in Shaw v. Delta Air Lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.141" offset="809159">In Shaw, this Court unanimously ruled that a State disability insurance benefits law was not preempted by ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.295" offset="837789">In that ruling, the Court explained the relates-to language of the ERISA preemption provision in two ways: first, the Court said that relates-to ordinarily means a reference to or a benefit or a connection with an employee benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.673" offset="899229">On the other hand, the court said that there may be some State actions that affect ERISA-covered plans in two remote peripheral or tenuous a way to warrant a finding that the law relates to the ERISA-covered plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.914" offset="952205">For the reasons that follow, we do not believe that the Equity Amendment Act relates to ERISA-covered plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.235" offset="977492">The act does not refer to ERISA-covered plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.502" offset="990553">Instead, its reference is employees and benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.906" offset="1012182">It applies to all employers in the District, including employers who are not subject to ERISA at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.977" offset="1040499">It does not regulate the content or administration of ERISA... covered plans, and it does not require employers to alter in any way their ERISA-covered plans.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="234.868" offset="1080101">Is that because you can provide health insurance coverage without having an ERISA plan?</text>
            <text syncTime="242.106" offset="1109044">You simply buy a policy, group policy for your employees, and that's not ERISA-covered.</text>

            <text syncTime="249.544" offset="1138720">My understanding is that Governments and churches are exempt from ERISA coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.317" offset="1173828">All private employers are not exempt from ERISA.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.971" offset="1196502">So if an employer, say, having 15 people simply wants to cover his employees with health insurance and buys a group insurance policy, that's covered by ERISA.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="279.231" offset="1257524">Well then, it does seem that the statutory scheme here does impinge on ERISA-covered plans in almost all cases in that the employer's liability must be determined by the contents of the plan, and any time he changes or she changes the plan in any way, the extent of liability under the statute changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.333" offset="1377897">It seems to me that in effect incorporates an ERISA plan into your statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="316.170" offset="1405273">--I don't believe it does, I think for essentially two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.622" offset="1423036">First, let us assume that instead of ERISA being passed in 1974 and the Equity Amendment Act being passed in 1990 the reverse was true, and for 16 years the Board of Trade, for example, has been paying health insurance as Workers Compensation because the Board of Trade otherwise voluntarily provides the benefits to his employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.022" offset="1532646">ERISA then is passed, say, in 1990, and suddenly the Board of Trade has responsibilities to the Federal Government, reporting, disclosure, and fiduciary responsibilities insofar as his health insurance benefits for active workers are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.234" offset="1601505">But I think this illustrates that although there is some kind of connection, if you will, between our law, because it governs health plans--</text>

            <text syncTime="719.738" offset="3019536">Well, it is measured by whatever benefits employers provide to their employers, whether or not these employers are otherwise subject to ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.178" offset="3053286">But to go back to the Workers... the common law analogy I was giving you, I think this would... will make very distinct the difference between the common law action that our statute is trying to replace and the common law action at issue in Ingersoll-Rand.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.188" offset="3109293">Let's look at a State such as Texas, in which Workers Compensation is not mandatory and employers may opt out of the Workers Compensation system but they're otherwise subject to the common law tort remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.864" offset="3176062">Everybody who has filed a brief in this case agrees that in a case in which the employer is subject to the common law that Workers Compensation basically replaces, that worker may require, if he's injured on the job, not only his wages but all lost benefits, including health insurance benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.944" offset="3256310">Everybody agrees upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.813" offset="3263833">Our statute, what it does, I think, is to make liability attach when there is a work-related injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.871" offset="3312107">Remedy is measured separately, but just as in the common law Workers Compensation law liability attaches if there's negligence, here it simply attaches if there's a work... related injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.844" offset="3359964">We're just measuring a remedy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.796" offset="3379817">Now, if I could follow up, there was a recent district court decision, I think, that may help to answer your question and also illustrate some of the problems that the States are facing in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.437" offset="3434360">This is a case from Texas... I think it's called Urene against Wyatt Cafeterias... in which you had an employer who opted out of the Workers Compensation plan... Workers Compensation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.662" offset="3475216">The law did impose some requirements on employers who opted out.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.030" offset="3492666">An employee of Wyatt had a slip and fall and was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.600" offset="3510951">She brought a negligence action against Wyatt Cafeterias and the court... the employer argued that the common law cause of action was preempted by ERISA because the employer had included in its ERISA-covered plan a provision that governed job-related injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.947" offset="3600395">The trial court in that case first concluded that this little ERISA plan in effect preempted... preempted the Workers Compensation alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.822" offset="3647833">On reconsideration, what the court did was to say, look, this is... you know, since the employer has opted out of the Workers Compensation system, this case is no different from an ordinary tort case and the fact that the employer has tried to, I guess, evade its responsibilities under Workers Compensation law by passing this modest provision in its ERISA-covered plan isn't enough to take it... you know, the State law still applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.174" offset="3769250">What the court did on I-consideration also was to say that the plan benefits could be considered, but only as an offset to the damages remedies, but that employers cannot set up grounds for the purpose of evading lawful State requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.825" offset="3871859">But to go back to what I was saying, the Court has never held a law like this one preempted, and it seems to me that the Court should not attribute to Congress, when everyone I think concedes except for the United States... attribute to Congress an intention of permitting employers to require health benefit... permitting employers to require health benefits as part of Workers Compensation but then saying that the only way you can do it is in a way that is administratively difficult and that doesn't comport with traditional Workers Compensation principles, and that's what the D.C. circuit has held here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1858.931" offset="7576336">So that any State law that specifically deals with a covered ERISA plan... I mean, Congress made a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.851" offset="7604026">If they wanted to say, look, any time there's a conflict Workers Compensation always prevails over the ERISA plan, it would have been very easy, they could have just stuck it in to section 514(b), but instead they made a conscious decision, we're going to let Workers Compensation out of our reporting requirements, out of our fiduciary requirements, which made sense because Workers Comp usually has their own laws that regulate those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.200" offset="7697335">But they would not go so far as to allow them to relate to a covered ERISA plan, because to do that would then discourage the employers to give those covered benefits to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.906" offset="7740176">And I think it's... that result is unavoidable from the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.043" offset="7764731">I think as your questioning makes clear, the problem with Shaw is that 1) the Shaw statute did not relate to a covered ERISA plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.899" offset="7800153">It dealt with a disability law and it did not in any way relate to a covered ERISA plan, so it's simply not applicable, and even if the Court would uphold that as Justice Scalia noted, there's nothing in the statute that allows for any type of exception, if you will, to the relates-to language, and again, if Congress wanted to do that, it could have put Workers Compensation in section 514(b), and it did not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3453.935" offset="13956274">First of all, I'd like to point out that the Equity Amendment Act does not single out ERISA-covered plans for special treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.541" offset="13990755">It treats ERISA-exempt and ERISA-covered plans in the same fashion, and in this respect it does differ from the statute that this Court considered in Mackey, or the exemption to the garnishment statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.599" offset="14043000">The only place in which our Worker's Compensation law does mention ERISA-covered plans is of course in the provision of our law that permits Worker's Compensation benefits to be integrated with benefits provided under ERISA-covered plans, and that statute is cited at page 9, note 9 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.295" offset="14129727">No one has suggested that this aspect of the statute, which does specifically refer to ERISA-covered plans, is preempted by ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.003" offset="14172568">2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.938" offset="14180300">I think in this case the Board of Trade is using ERISA as a sword to invalidate valid Worker's Compensation laws and not as a shield.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.245" offset="14233590">If we were to abolish our Worker's Compensation system and allow employers to be sued based on a showing simply of negligence, and we could even eliminate the affirmative defenses that an employer otherwise would have, all employees who could... who were injured on the job in the District of Columbia and who could establish negligence, or I suppose we could even employee a standard of strict liability, each one of those employees could recover as part of his damages not only wages lost and the cost of treating the injury or illness, but the value of health benefits lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.656" offset="14391160">Our Worker's Compensation merely reflects that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.024" offset="14404640">It imposes liability when there's a work-related injury, and the remedy is measured by what an employee otherwise receives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.564" offset="14442883">The last point I would like to... two other points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.266" offset="14453645">There's some suggestion here that somehow our law is invalid, our amendment is invalid because it's somewhat innovative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.022" offset="14484679">The Court rejected a similar argument not only in Metropolitan Life but in the 1988 case of Goodyear Atomic Corporation against Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.828" offset="14527937">That case is also interesting because it involves a Worker's Compensation law and an unusual one that was applied to the United States itself pursuant to a congressional enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.285" offset="14577675">I think that case establishes two things: Congress' great deference to the States in managing their own worker's Compensation plans, and that innovative Worker's Compensation laws are not prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.028" offset="14636711">Finally, if I could just mention COBRA for a moment, the United States has argued that COBRA affects this Court's analysis in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.003" offset="14676626">One is on the relates... to point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.205" offset="14685404">It says that because COBRA affects ERISA-covered plans by this continuation of coverage--</text>
