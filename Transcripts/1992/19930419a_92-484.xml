            <text syncTime="13.886" offset="195396">Mr. Wright.</text>

            <label>Mr. Christopher J. Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="15.307" offset="201039">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.682" offset="210547">This unusual case arose out of a dispute concerning the proper construction of section 92 of the banking laws, a provision that authorizes banks in small towns to sell insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.754" offset="254851">No question was raised about the validity of section 92.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.924" offset="271569">In fact, the Insurance Agents pointed out that at this late date, they thought there was no real question about whether section 92 remained in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.890" offset="307409">They pointed out that the Controller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Board has assumed its continued existence for more than 70 years; that the banking industry and the insurance industry had relied on section 92; and that Congress and... and the courts had... had as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.633" offset="378358">But the D.C. Circuit, nevertheless, held that section 92 had been repealed by Congress in 1918.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.911" offset="407510">And that's the question presented to this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.941" offset="419631">The dispute between the parties has necessarily turned on a few phrases and some quotation marks in... in a number of documents that were written more than 70 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.499" offset="465816">And I'd like to direct the Court's attention to those documents this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.059" offset="484101">But before I do so, I... I'd like to say two things about what I think close analysis of these documents shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.369" offset="509388">The first thing it shows is that Congress did not intend to repeal section 92.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.757" offset="530913">The Second Circuit has issued a decision on this issue since the D.C. Circuit handed down the judgment in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.535" offset="557976">And the Second Circuit, in... in holding that section 92 had not been repealed, stressed the clarity of the evidence showing that this is not what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.657" offset="594443">And, indeed, the Insurance Agents, while they are now defending the D.C. Circuit's decision that... that section 92 has been repealed, they do not claim, as I understand it anyway, that Congress intended to repeal section 92.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.306" offset="657136">But I don't want to give what I think is the false impression that this case presents some sort of clash between Congress's intent and... and the text that Congress enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.724" offset="706769">The second point that I think that a close analysis of the documents that I want to direct the Court's attention to this morning shows is that in fact the text of those documents supports the conclusion that section 92 was not repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.203" offset="760686">And... and I... and I hope to show that the only thing that's really on the Insurance Agents' side of this dispute is some quotation marks.</text>

            <text syncTime="218.256" offset="1012924">That is to say, the... in fact, the 1926 edition of the U.S. Code was the very first edition of the U.S. Code--</text>

            <text syncTime="247.682" offset="1130580">And... and apparently decided that it'd stayed in effect since... since Congress has twice, in the last 11 years, actually amended section 92.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.786" offset="1171017">Of course, the holding that section 92 was repealed makes those congressional enactments totally superfluous.</text>

            <text syncTime="292.898" offset="1311452">--But the... a... a... as I say, the regulations governing sales of insurance by banks in small towns have been in effect since 1916, have continued in effect to this day.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.250" offset="1380833">This case just involved an interpretation of... of... of whether... of to whom banks in small towns may sell insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.074" offset="1412180">And as I say, even the insurance industry thought that there was no question about the continued existence of section 92.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.401" offset="1437466">And as Judge Pratt emphasized in his District Court opinion, you know, the banking industry has... had relied on this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.646" offset="1470485">A lot of banks in small towns have made substantial investments in... in the insurance business.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.615" offset="1490338">And... and... and have relied on the Controller and everyone else's assumption in the operation of their business to... that section 92 exists.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.607" offset="1554286">I... there are many versions of them printed.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.731" offset="1566825">I... I have the... the bank's cert petition in front of me and... and I was hoping to direct the Court's attention to page... page 77a of that... of the appendix to that petition, which... which, on that single page, presents two of the critical statutes that are... that are involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.392" offset="1669434">The dispute between the parties re... really boils down to was this provision, section 92, was it added to revise statute section 5202 or was it added to section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="397.261" offset="1728888">And both of those provisions are actually printed on this page of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.181" offset="1744562">Section 5202 is up at the top of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.336" offset="1757205">And I'd just like to make a... a brief note about that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.039" offset="1772043">It had actually been in effect in some form or another since 1863.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.552" offset="1790119">It... and it had always dealt with the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.129" offset="1800359">It... it... it involves the excess indebtedness that national banks may... may incur.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.815" offset="1823138">And the version that's printed in the bank's appendix here is the way section 5202 looked before section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act was enacted in 1913.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.451" offset="1865665">Now, right under that, about halfway down the page, is section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act just the way it was printed in 1913, the... the... which is when the Federal Reserve Act was enacted for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.445" offset="1917597">So everything in this provision basically is new, with one exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.974" offset="1935778">And I'd like to direct the Court's attention to that exception which appears on page 79a of the appendix.</text>

            <text syncTime="460.674" offset="1982590">However, near the bottom of page 79 of the appendix, you'll see a paragraph that begins:</text>
            <text syncTime="466.781" offset="2006936">"Section 5202 of the revised statutes of the United States is hereby amended so as to read as follows. "</text>
            <text syncTime="474.823" offset="2039119">And it then reprints section 5202, the provision we were just looking at, almost exactly the way it existed before 1913, with one addition.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.742" offset="2078825">And that addition appears on page 80a of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.524" offset="2090005">It's the line that begins fifth, and says that liabilities incurred under the provisions of... of the Federal Reserve Act, that banks may also incur those in excess of their... of their capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.880" offset="2131383">This is a... a strange provision, at least today, a peculiar practice, that section 5202 was amended as part of the Federal Reserve Act, right in the middle of a number of other provisions amending the Federal Reserve Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.498" offset="2197839">This appendix doesn't show it, but we've just been looking at the 1913 vers... I mean of section 13, the... section 12 of the Federal Reserve Act is right before what's printed here, section 14 of the Federal Reserve Act is what comes right after what's printed here, and... and in fact it goes 1 through 16 around this.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.147" offset="2272444">But at that time Congress had the peculiar habit of occasionally amending the revised statutes as part of an act.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.440" offset="2309643">I'd also like to direct the Court's attention to the very next paragraph on... on page 80a, a paragraph that I think is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.670" offset="2342557">It's... it's the key to... to our textual argument here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.997" offset="2359798">It involves the re-discount authority of... of... of Federal Reserve Banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.401" offset="2381427">That provision was clearly part of section 13 of the... of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.820" offset="2411102">And... and that's shown by... by a couple of things, one of which is reading the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.302" offset="2441091">It very logically belongs in the Federal Reserve Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.051" offset="2452062">This provision grants the Federal Reserve Board authority over the rediscounting practices of Federal Reserve Banks, and it logically belongs in the Federal Reserve Act for that reason, rather than in some other provision of the banking statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.248" offset="2512875">Another thing about this provision is that it includes the phrase, "this act".</text>
            <text syncTime="600.275" offset="2540983">"This act" are the last... last word of the third line and the first word of the fourth line.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.790" offset="2559060">It is undisputed that "this act" means the Federal Reserve Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.865" offset="2575360">The Insurance Agents agree with us on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.147" offset="2584451">We say that it refers to the Federal Reserve Act as this act for the straightforward reason that it was part of the Federal Reserve Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="676.619" offset="2846302">Let me... let me point out, right at the top of that page the title of this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.274" offset="2868976">It says it's an act to amend certain sections of the act entitled Federal Reserve Act approved December 23rd, 1913.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.068" offset="2900114">Now, that title doesn't have controlling authority, but as we pointed out in more detail in our brief, the practice at that time was that Congress had two kinds of titles.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.360" offset="2941283">One was a descriptive title, you know, an act to improve the Federal banking system or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.735" offset="2962808">The other sort of title Congress used was this sort of title.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.670" offset="2978586">It identified the acts that were being amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.996" offset="2987886">Now, what it did when it listed the acts that were being amended, it had some awfully long titles because they listed everything that was being amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.197" offset="3016621">This one lists the Federal Reserve Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.680" offset="3030622">It says nothing about revised statute 5202 being amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.099" offset="3048281">And that's important because we don't think section 5202 was amended in 1916, and the Insurance Agents think it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.268" offset="3080882">Now, towards the bottom of page 67a comes an indentation, and then it says section 13... that section 13b and is hereby amended so as to read as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.389" offset="3129365">So Congress is mending... is amending section 13, which we were looking at a minute ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.966" offset="3147755">And the... the bank, in the appendix, has added these little numbers in the parenthesis.</text>

            <text syncTime="783.655" offset="3274501">But when you get to page 70a and you get to that paragraph that begins number 7, that's where... that's where there is some disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.870" offset="3307311">We contend that 7, 8, 9, and 10 are all part of section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.570" offset="3334165">The Insurance Agents say that they were all moved into... into revised statute 5202.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.162" offset="3360496">And that's important to their argument because they're going to say... they then say that when revised statute 5202 was amended in 1918 and Congress didn't... didn't include the paragraphs numbered 8, 9 and 10, those paragraphs all got repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.234" offset="3420787">Now, I'd like to... I'd like to focus again on paragraph number 8, which is at the bottom of page 70a.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.403" offset="3457463">That's the paragraph I was looking at just a minute ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.324" offset="3465195">It is almost identical... it's the rediscounting paragraph... it's almost identical to the paragraph the way it existed in 1913.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.632" offset="3498423">Just a couple of words were changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.459" offset="3505737">And I'd like to make the two points again that I made before.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.459" offset="3517649">First, it refers to "this act".</text>
            <text syncTime="846.771" offset="3526949">We say it refers to "this act" because it was part of the Federal Reserve Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.471" offset="3545757">And if we're right on that, we win this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.299" offset="3561012">The second thing is that it again, just as in 1913, grants the Federal Reserve Board authority over re-discounting practices of Federal Reserve Banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.762" offset="3606883">This provision belongs in the Federal Reserve Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.512" offset="3617959">Now, the argument to the contrary relies on... on these quotation marks that you'll see if you look closely at... at the 1916 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.740" offset="3670831">In paragraph 7, following that introductory phrase about section 5202 of the revised statute's being amended, there's a colon, and then there are some open quotation marks.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.454" offset="3713672">No closed quotation marks appear again until after the paragraph marked number 10, which precedes an amendment to section 14 of the Federal Reserve Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.575" offset="3758185">The Insurance Agents argue, on the basis of those quotation marks, that Congress actually moved that re-discounting paragraph out of section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act and into section 5202 in 1916, and then, in 1918, omitted it altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.817" offset="3831119">And that's important in this case because they contend that the same thing happened to the paragraph numbered 9 here.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.814" offset="3859122">And that paragraph numbered 9 is the... is the paragraph that's ultimately at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.047" offset="3880020">Nine is the one that grants banks in small towns the authority to sell insurance.</text>

            <text syncTime="978.967" offset="4055772">So there was a separate section 5202 and it was amended, and Congress knew that people were going to... were going to draw out section 5202 of the revised statutes from time to time and look at this provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1027.587" offset="4250227">What happened... and this is detailed in the lodging that was filed by the bank if you follow through all the documents... when Congress... the original bill in 1916 included some quotation marks, it did not include these confusing quotation marks that were ultimately on... in... that ultimately appeared in the statutes at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.047" offset="4344059">The quotation marks that were on the original bill just started at the beginning of section 13 is hereby amended, and ended at the end.</text>

            <text syncTime="3125.185" offset="12640549">It's an official Senate document.</text>

            <text syncTime="3138.882" offset="12695406">This is Senate document 412, and it's cited in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.022" offset="12707945">In 1917, what the Controller thought had happened in 1916 was that section 92 appeared twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.800" offset="12747024">It appears in the Federal Reserve Act and it appears in the National Banking Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.736" offset="12762802">Now, this is another... this is... and this is actually I think the more significant document... it's also cited... this is the 1920 compilation, after everything that's most relevant had happened, at the end of the day, the Senate published another collection of the banking laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.320" offset="12837094">It was also compiled by the Controller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.351" offset="12853290">The Controller thought that section 92 was still in existence, and it was still in existence in only one place, in section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.847" offset="12891220">And, as Justice Souter said, one explanation... in fact, the explanation that flows most logically from the D.C. Circuit's reasoning is that Congress may well have thought that two versions of... two versions of section 92 were one too many, and it cured that in 1918.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.388" offset="12957362">And after 1918, there was one and only one version of section 92 and it was located in the Federal Reserve Act, until 1926, when the first compilers of the U.S. Code moved it to 12 USC, section 92.</text>

            <text syncTime="3256.819" offset="13167177">But the 1920 compilation shows it once, and for 70 years everyone has assumed that... everyone has operated on the assumption that section 92 is in existence.</text>
