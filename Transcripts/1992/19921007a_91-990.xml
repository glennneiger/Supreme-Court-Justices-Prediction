            <text syncTime="11.808" offset="188625">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.541" offset="199492">In Carey v. Piphus this Court held that procedural due process is so important to organized society that it is actionable even without a showing of actual damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.900" offset="248916">In this case a jury found that the respondent had knowingly violated Joseph Farrar's constitutional rights to procedural due process essentially by obtaining a closing of this school for incorrigible delinquent children without prior administrative proceedings and hearings to which he was entitled under state law and by the process of a state court proceeding that didn't involve a fair and unbiased judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.301" offset="354555">In all events the Fifth Circuit in 1985 concluded on the basis of that jury verdict that the petitioner was entitled at least to nominal damages, it having been found by the jury that his rights to procedural due process have been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.744" offset="420279">They found that notwithstanding the fact that that same jury had also found that Dr. Farrar had been unable to prove that he had sustained actual damages, but of course under Carey against Piphus that was essentially irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.035" offset="465523">He was entitled to an award of nominal damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.170" offset="478062">The question in this case is does that final determination of entitlement to a judgment for nominal damages, not more than $1.00, in a case involving the deprivation of procedural due process entitle the plaintiff who recovered that judgment to also recover reasonable attorneys' fees under 42 United States Code Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.269" offset="570431">We submit that the question, that the answer to that question can be found in four separate places.</text>

            <text syncTime="240.689" offset="1104060">That's something that occurred in a trial that occurred 10 years after the fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="320.141" offset="1421918">Then Lieutenant Governor Hobby, despite the fact that he had no relationship to the closing of the school, actually went to the hearing in Liberty County, which was an ex parte hearing, the theory that was presented to the jury being that that was to bring political pressure to bear on the fact finder to make him not an impartial fact finder in the procedural due process sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="467.920" offset="2013017">Let me direct first the question of de minimis.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.070" offset="2021585">The term de minimis refers to a type of injury which is so trifling that the law can't take it into account, the law can't do anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.276" offset="2054500">That's what the phrase de minimis non curat lex means, the law can't do anything about it because it is so trifling.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.216" offset="2086160">In fact Carey against Piphus specifically says that the law can, will, and indeed must do something about procedural due process violations, namely give a judgment, albeit for $1.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.107" offset="2137778">That means that the law will, in fact this is the phrase that comes out repeatedly both in Carey and of course in Memphis Community Schools v. Stachura, vindicate the right to procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.997" offset="2181350">Procedural due process rights are intrinsically non-pecuniar.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.116" offset="2201830">They are the type of things that don't necessarily result in money damages occurring.</text>

            <text syncTime="2146.976" offset="8729203">Well, Your Honor, that goes to what I'm going to respectfully suggest to you as the third part of my argument, and that is where Your Honors ought to go with this case as far as establishing the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.949" offset="8773089">While I hope it's not presumptuous, I do have some respectful suggestions to make to you in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.770" offset="8796390">But Your Honors in TSTA v. Garland and Hewitt v. Helms went to great lengths to establish very, very carefully a standard, that's the way you describe it, and you set forth the various tests or prongs that one needs to go through in order to determine whether that standard has been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.324" offset="8930660">And we would respectfully say that when you look at this case, not an isolated part of the case like one jury finding, but when you look at the whole case one comes to the conclusion that the plaintiff has not gotten over any of the four hurdles, and he certainly has not gotten over the last of those four hurdles, or the second of the hurdles for that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.809" offset="9032537">The first hurdle is the one where the plaintiff comes close to getting over the hurdle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.011" offset="9049360">And the first aspect of the hurdle is whether or not the plaintiff has achieved success on a significant issue in the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.985" offset="9093246">And civil rights are so important, and Your Honors' regard for those civil rights is so important that it can be certainly argued that in this case the jury finding creates success on the significant issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.959" offset="9149148">We would say here, however, that if you look at the entire jury verdict and if you look at the jury verdict in the light of the pleadings and the facts, the plaintiff has not even established success on a significant issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.403" offset="9206931">And that is true for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.338" offset="9214663">Hobby was one of only multiple defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.223" offset="9230232">Hobby was accused, along with the others, of being a member of a conspiracy to deprive Farrar of his civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.430" offset="9271087">The jury found that all of the other defendants were conspirators, but that Hobby was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.536" offset="9307450">If Hobby had been found a member of the conspiracy we wouldn't be here today because they would have never reached the issue that was decided against Hobby.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.428" offset="9355097">The jury went on to find, however, that the conspiracy did not cause these plaintiffs any damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.450" offset="9387176">In response to a conditioned question they found that Hobby had committed an action under state law which deprived the plaintiff of his civil right, but that that was not the cause of any damage to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.126" offset="9445899">Now, in the light of the pleadings and the evidence that Hobby did nothing alone, there was no evidence that Hobby did anything by himself, the jury's finding is senseless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.601" offset="9495740">It just doesn't make any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.903" offset="9508906">In the light of the jury's finding that the plaintiffs had proved no damage, it is clear in the light of the evidence, which was largely undisputed, that these defendants did not cause the plaintiffs any damage and that the Farrar's own conduct was the cause of their rather considerable pecuniary damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.168" offset="9605977">And they had considerable pecuniary damage which was constantly emphasized during the trial of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.940" offset="9637115">So we contend first of all that if you look at the case as a whole, not just a single jury verdict, that the plaintiffs didn't get over the first hurdle of proving significant success on the material issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.515" offset="9687375">The second prong of the test is even more clearly applicable to our test, and that is that the plaintiff in the language of Garland received some of the relief which he sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.107" offset="9749755">Here, as I think my friend Mr. Birnberg clearly admits, the plaintiff sought only considerable monetary compensable damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.601" offset="9799701">He got not one penny of compensatory damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="3135.769" offset="12684456">I'm sure, Your Honor, if that's what, that's the way you read our brief that's the way it should be read.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.471" offset="12707234">But one, another thing that our adversary and I agree on is the importance of Carey v. Piphus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.576" offset="12735656">Carey v. Piphus we, with respectful for Your Honors, is frequently miscited or overstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.646" offset="12759897">What the plaintiff was attempting to establish in Carey v. Piphus was that constitutional rights were so different from usual rights that the plaintiff was entitled to an award of compensatory damages even if he hadn't proved any.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.538" offset="12807545">That approach was rejected, and it was rejected by Justice Powell saying this, rights, constitutional and otherwise, do not exist in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.096" offset="12849758">Their purpose is to protect persons from injuries, to protect particular interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.915" offset="12877030">Our legal system's concept of damages reflects this view of legal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.801" offset="12896570">The cardinal principle of damages in Anglo-American law is that of compensation for the injury caused to plaintiff by defendant's breach of duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.009" offset="12937425">And we say to Your Honors that the key fact in this case is that the jury's verdict says loud and clear that these defendants and their conduct did not cause any injury to these plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.269" offset="12994372">And in the light of that, Your Honor, we say it would be inconceivable that the plaintiffs could, using ordinary, standard, common sense language be deemed to be prevailing parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.759" offset="13048394">Thank you very much.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gerald M. Birnberg</label>
            <text syncTime="3232.330" offset="13070650">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.948" offset="13081099">Let me address that very last point first as a matter of fact and try to clarify, and I think Justice Scalia was particularly interested in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.371" offset="13110878">The specific jury question about the compensatory damages was this, do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that such act or acts were a proximate cause of any damages to plaintiff Joseph Davis Farrar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.679" offset="13164064">Now, the jury's instructions, the court's instructions erroneously described proximate cause as requiring foreseeability in the sense that Governor Hobby had to foresee that what he did would cause the type of results that they caused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.521" offset="13219443">So the explanation in this particular case for why the jury found a lack of actual damages actually goes to, and this was litigated in the courts below, the erroneous definition of foreseeability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.996" offset="13265314">And that is what taints that whole suggestion--</text>

            <label>Mr. Gerald M. Birnberg</label>
            <text syncTime="3285.965" offset="13285167">--That is correct, and that's the reason the appellate court didn't address it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.583" offset="13299692">But that does deprive that very jury instruction of its significance.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="3293.219" offset="13314216">Well, just as respondent is stuck with the $1.00 award because it's in the question presented, I don't see what you gain by arguing that there was an improper jury instruction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gerald_m_birnberg" startTime="3303.308" stopTime="3524.119">
            <label>Mr. Gerald M. Birnberg</label>
            <text syncTime="3303.308" offset="13354549">Then, Chief Justice, I shall not anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.427" offset="13363012">I shall move on instead to the next point which is I wanted to correct something my very, that Mr. Cowan, very able counsel, but I think he may be confused about the facts of Hewitt against Helms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.619" offset="13423825">That's the one he said was the on all fours case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.238" offset="13434274">Well, of course in Hewitt against Helms, and it starts with Justice Scalia's comment about the fact this is bizarre, here we have somebody who is claiming to be a prevailing party who had never won anything and lost the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.231" offset="13486310">Hewitt against Helms is the case in which the judgment goes against the plaintiff on qualified immunity grounds and the plaintiff actually won nothing at any time in Hewitt against Helms except an interlocutory declaration by the appellate court that it was okay for him to maintain his lawsuit, that it couldn't be dismissed on 12(b)(6) grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.209" offset="13566140">That certainly is not anything approaching the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.161" offset="13577948">In fact we have got exactly the opposite here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.763" offset="13588397">We've got a case here in which the plaintiff in fact got the judgment and the respondent is saying nonetheless he is not the prevailing party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.619" offset="13619848">It seems to us it's the flip side of the situation that was presented in Hewitt against Helms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.689" offset="13640119">I had started, Justice O'Connor, addressing the two phrases are de minimis and technical, and I think I had addressed the de minimis issue in the context of de minimis non curat lex.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.514" offset="13691424">Technical, there's a very interesting thing about all of the cases that you describe in that opinion, and all of them really, in which you suggest that these might be examples of technical victories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.619" offset="13731861">And every technical victory has this common thread.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.090" offset="13745654">They are all cases in which really there was no concrete justiciable controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.892" offset="13768955">They were all contrived or hypothetical controversies, such as there was the footnote that referred to the old district court opinion where there was a challenge to an ancient curfew law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.016" offset="13809393">Nobody had threatened prosecution under the curfew law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.135" offset="13821932">Yes, they won a finding that the curfew law had unconstitutional aspects to it, but so what, nobody was threatened under that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.240" offset="13854323">All of those cases, I submit to the Court, where there has been something that one could regard as a technical violation, are cases in which in point of fact they were non justiciable to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.279" offset="13898418">The TSTA v. Garland has the example of the one part of the regulation that none of the teachers had ever been denied permission to meet pursuant to, never expected to ask that that particular part of the regulation be implication, and counsel at oral argument conceded that that part of the case did not come across the threshold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.943" offset="13977099">It was a hypothetical, theoretical, not real violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.664" offset="13999982">And that's really the difference here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.966" offset="14009177">What we're dealing with here is, and I think this is the threshold, is an actual deprivation, one that the jury has found actually occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.138" offset="14041883">And in fact the jury instruction, it's not just one, it's two jury questions that find that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.340" offset="14058705">The one that we have referred to before where the jury found that Hobby committed act or acts under color of law that deprived the plaintiff of civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution, but there is also, and I think this is a significant one, the very, the second jury question asked whether Hobby was entitled to qualified immunity, and the jury found that he was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.837" offset="14136655">And when you superimpose that upon the instructions which defined qualified immunity you will find that the qualified immunity instructions required them to find that he knowingly violated a constitutional right, knowing that he had done wrong, and without any good faith or other extenuating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.631" offset="14207917">So... I see the red light is on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.167" offset="14218052">I appreciate, we would ask the Court that this judgment be reversed.</text>
