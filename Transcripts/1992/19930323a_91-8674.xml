            <text syncTime="55.829" offset="352044">John Angus Smith was convicted of a violation of title 18, United States Code, 924(c), when he possessed a firearm and offered it as an item in trade for barter for a small quantity of drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.456" offset="406483">As a result of his conviction, he received 30 years minimum sentence, consecutive to the terms he received on his other counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.272" offset="441800">The issue today is whether the offering of a firearm solely as an item of barter violates 18 United States Code 924(c) for the use of a firearm during and in relation to a Federal drug trafficking crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.623" offset="503240">At the outset, it is important to realize that this statute provides two different methods by which it could be violated: first, by the use of a firearm during and in relation to the Federal drug trafficking crime; and the second way is by carrying the firearm during and in relation to the Federal drug trafficking crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="192.897" offset="900302">There could never be a situation where someone could use a firearm under their definition or under the definition of the majority of the lower courts where one would not be also carrying.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.675" offset="943351">I mean, if you would carry it, you always would use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.887" offset="956204">And the principles... I cannot think of a situation under their definition where it could not occur.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gary Kollin</label>
            <text syncTime="216.383" offset="994238">Under their definition, it's to possess with the intent to facilitate the crime, to possess and the presumption of intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.600" offset="1039064">So, under their definition, any time that one is carrying the firearm, one is always using it in regard to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.456" offset="1078561">And the basic axiomatic rules of construction of this Court is that we should never render a term in a statute to be superfluous and that each word should be given effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.556" offset="1130911">And if we don't narrow the definition of the word use to the definition that we have suggested here, that is, to define that use means the actual use in the active connotation... according to the active connotation of the word use, then the word carry would have no definition.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="269.686" offset="1207397">I mean, we really haven't accomplished a whole lot if carry means what you say it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.871" offset="1228191">Really, I mean, it may be important to this case, but use and carry covers everything in the world then.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.644" offset="1247312">The dispute between you and the Government is that the Government says use carries everything in the world, and you say, no, it's only use or carry that covers everything in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.270" offset="1281794">So, for later cases, this dispute is really not very important I suppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.363" offset="1298199">With due respect, Justice, I disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.406" offset="1310320">And the reason I would disagree is because the decisions that are cited by the Government in its brief and some of the decisions that I cite in our brief is that there are situations that... where somebody has a firearm that is located proximally to where drugs are being held, and those people have been convicted of use, people who have been convicted of use who have firearms that are totally inoperable, that do not have firing pins, do not have ammunition, that are located in remote locations.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.785" offset="1427871">Those people have also been convicted of use under their definition and the majority of the lower courts'.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.828" offset="1452008">In fact, in Justice White's... in Justice Thomas' dissent in Mewks v. United States, that was their concern that this definition of the word use is... becomes an all-encompassing definition and it means possession and presumes the intent to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.159" offset="1525360">So, not only is this important to the case of John Angus Smith, but it is important to countless others who may possess firearms and not have a use.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.506" offset="1566738">Moreover, with this definition that the Government encourages here, both in the lower courts and from this Court, it also encourages the lower courts to engage in psycho journeys into the defendants' minds to try and determine their intent, and it requires situation-by-situation, case-by-case analyses--</text>

            <text syncTime="386.995" offset="1676661">Well, it means to use it, to brandish it, to fire it as an offensive weapon.</text>

            <text syncTime="397.250" offset="1717725">Well, then you're saying that... you're really putting quite a narrow construction on the phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.606" offset="1747087">One doesn't ordinarily think of the kind of drug transactions that the statute is... don't you think of them as being more consensual than involving somebody sticking somebody up and getting drugs from them?</text>

            <label>Mr. Gary Kollin</label>
            <text syncTime="416.933" offset="1796406">Well, also but it's an offensive weapon to protect themselves or... as a weapon in the normal connotation of the way the item is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.129" offset="1833187">As an example, Mr. Chief Justice, let's say a carpenter is carrying a hammer on his side, on his belt.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.514" offset="1862757">And an individual would go up to the carpenter and say may I borrow the hammer.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.007" offset="1880729">Am I... are you using it?</text>
            <text syncTime="440.100" offset="1889089">The carpenter, while he would be carrying the hammer, would say no, I'm not using it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.922" offset="1908419">You may borrow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.204" offset="1913539">Secondly, if the carpenter goes ahead and trades that hammer for a board, similar to John Angus Smith trading the gun for drugs, we would not say the carpenter used the hammer under a normal way of speaking or normal connotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.734" offset="1971636">We would say the carpenter traded the hammer.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.603" offset="1979159">And so, in regard to this statute, I believe that--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="466.817" offset="1995982">You could say the carpenter used the hammer to obtain what he traded it for.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gary Kollin</label>
            <text syncTime="472.991" offset="2020641">--Yes, but I don't think that's the normal connotation of the word use.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.352" offset="2034120">I think similarly to this situation is the problem this Court faced in Public Citizen v. Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.616" offset="2059198">In that case, the Court said that the word utilized... it's a very similar word I think to the word uses... is a wooly verb, its contours left undefined by the statute itself, and went through its analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.396" offset="2118235">And I think similarly the word use here has a certain manner of uncertainty to it, and when it has this manner of uncertainty and ambiguity to it, then we must resort... well, then we have the... we look to the legislative history and also we can look to the rule of lenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.299" offset="2185944">And in looking to the legislative history in regard to this statute, I think that the legislative history supports the position of the petitioner in regard to this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.517" offset="2242787">The original statute... well, the... as this Court has noted in the cases of Simpson and Busic, the legislative history in regard to the statute was rather sparse.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.462" offset="2282597">And in this particular case, as presented in our brief, the original bill in regard to adding this... these provisions of 924(c) was added on the floor by Representative Casey, and in his words, he said that without the words... word carry in it, that it would apply to the actual use of the firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.590" offset="2383012">And then Representative Poff later proposed an amendment, also on the floor... and I noted in both situations there was a quorum present... that Representative Poff said that his amendment to the Casey proposal was not in derogation of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.620" offset="2447169">And so, therefore, in conjunction with the fact that the Senate proposal of Senator Dominick was not accepted, which was instead of using... instead of having the words use or carry, they had the word armed, that we must distinguish between use or carry, and in that situation looking at this legislative history, we see that the meaning of the word would not encompass the word... would go to its actual use in its normal capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.883" offset="2588230">In our brief, we also present what I presented as the pawn ticket hypothetical... and that's at page 15... in which we have an individual who takes a gun and several weeks before he decides to engage in any type of drug activity, takes the gun and pawns it at a pawn shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.639" offset="2695227">Later on, he decides to become involved in... excuse me... a drug trafficking event, and then trades the pawn ticket for the drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.199" offset="2753533">The Government acknowledges at footnote 20 that perhaps this does not fall within the normal understanding of the word use, and I could submit to you that there could be countless other situations like that, for instance, a bill of lading for gun parts that could be assembled into guns that could be traded, or for instance, other situations where an individual brings... is bringing home a quantity of drugs in a large box, and for some reason, the door keeps swinging shut, and there is a gun lying there that had no part in the transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2532.274" offset="10257781">That's true, Your Honor, and again, that might be a reason for a court concluding... we don't think it would be, but it might be a reason for a court concluding in that hypothetical that it's absurd to construe the statute that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.432" offset="10302398">But this case doesn't present that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.281" offset="10309817">This case falls squarely at the core of Congress' concern in adopting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.955" offset="10328520">Petitioner appears to concede that the use of a firearm... that the involvement of the firearm in this case was in relation to the predicate drug offense, and we agree that under any reasonable construction of the in relation to requirement, it has been satisfied in this case, despite the fact, as I said, that the Phelps court in the Ninth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2584.918" offset="10468328">Well, I believe the Court granted certiorari to decide whether this constitutes a use in relation to a drug trafficking crime, and we submit that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.193" offset="10509497">But in order to uphold the conviction, the use has... in order for the conviction to be valid, the use has to have been in relation to--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="2601.097" offset="10533111">Well, the question presented is whether the act of offering a firearm solely as an item of barter in trade for drugs violates 1924(c) for use of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.215" offset="10581595">So, you can say that certainly that question is subsumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.657" offset="10595283">But you would like us to... if you win the case, you would like us also to overrule the Ninth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2620.961" offset="10612524">--That would be nice, Your Honor, but... and I think, as the Chief Justice pointed out, in order to answer the question presented as we would, necessarily the Phelps decision has to be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.317" offset="10654006">In urging a narrower interpretation of section 924(c), petitioner in effect is asking this Court to rewrite the plain language of the statute to construe the term uses a firearm as if it read uses a firearm as a weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.039" offset="10716805">In our view, the statutory text forecloses that approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.772" offset="10731747">Congress specified the limitations it wanted to impose on the scope of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.844" offset="10752122">The use or carrying of a firearm must be during the commission of the predicate offense, and it must be in relation to the predicate offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.337" offset="10782006">Those two limitations do not include the ones sought by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.730" offset="10795590">So, the obvious inference is that Congress did not intend to adopt petitioner's version of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.493" offset="10818682">As I was discussing earlier, petitioner argues that our interpretation of the statute would render the word carries as superfluous, but in fact, that's not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.090" offset="10857030">If anything, it's petitioner's interpretation of the statute that would render a word superfluous because if petitioner is correct that the statute applies only to actual physical uses of firearms as an offensive weapon, it's difficult to see how one can actually use a firearm as an offensive weapon without also carrying it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.052" offset="10928919">And so, it's petitioner's interpretation of the statute that runs afoul of the rule that statutes should not be construed in order to render words superfluous.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gary Kollin</label>
            <text syncTime="2718.856" offset="11004151">As express words are placed in statutes and have to be read in their context, like use or carry, involved in, or used in, and not to make other words superfluous, in these cases with use or carry or involved in or used in, they are not mere iterations of spanning out of different methods of commission of the crimes, and we look at them in the normal parlance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.414" offset="11126405">The bank robbery conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.845" offset="11136122">Yes, I would agree that that is the facilitation of the commission of the crime and the person... other persons would be guilty under the concept of 18 United States Code, subsection... section 2 for aiding and abetting, just as the theory was tried to be made in the Busic case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.566" offset="11198920">I do not believe that the Government has been able to establish any example where someone can carry without using under its definition or the definitions accepted by the majority of the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.474" offset="11246568">The problem with regard to this definition is that it criminalizes the fact that somebody may have drugs that are proximate to a gun even where the guns are inoperable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.122" offset="11293170">There are situations where guns were at remote locations where the drug transactions weren't being committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.537" offset="11322845">This also... this same definition of use in this statute also accomplishes the law enforcement goal because it still allows law enforcement to encourage the person to leave the gun at home because if he is carrying the gun on his way to committing the crime, he is still guilty under the statute, and therefore is the same goal and same purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.911" offset="11420334">And the examples in the later 1984 statute... the versions talk about the methods of using it and they give examples by pointing it out in regard to the bank teller and individuals of that nature.</text>
