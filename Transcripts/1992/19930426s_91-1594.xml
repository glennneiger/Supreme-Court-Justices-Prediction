            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="7.496" offset="111653">As the Chief Justice has indicated this case is called Edenfield versus Fane.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.060" offset="129939">Mr. Scott Fane is a certified public accountant.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.458" offset="147598">He formally practiced in New Jersey where he had a successful practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.488" offset="163689">In 1985, he moved to Florida and he wanted to live there and start his accounting practice there.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.214" offset="194618">He intended to follow the same working pattern that he had had in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.353" offset="223144">He built his practice in New Jersey by soliciting business clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.953" offset="241534">He would call them by telephone and try to arrange a meeting and if he get arranged a face-to-face meeting, he would explain the skills the he had and how he might be a particular assistant to the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.685" offset="296496">But he could not do that in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.179" offset="306422">Florida had an anti-solicitation ban imposed by Florida Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.549" offset="331918">The ban prohibited accountants from in face or personal solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.730" offset="352607">And so it was -- Mr. Fane, brought this suit in the Federal Courts to challenge the constitutionality of this restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.454" offset="387506">He challenged it on the basis that when he was engaging in his speech, he was seeking to communicate truthful and non-deceptive information about a lawful transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.124" offset="450200">And the court has recognized that although this is called commercial speech, it is still entitled to the protection of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.651" offset="484368">We have said that this commercial speech has considerable value in the opinion of today.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.891" offset="505266">They say that the commercial market place like others fears of our social and cultural life by the form or ideas and information flash.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.095" offset="538076">And some of the ideas and information are vital and some are little worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.044" offset="553854">But the general rule is that the speaker and the audience not the government assess the value of the information presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.605" offset="576110">And so, even if a communication that there is no more than proposed the commercial transaction is entitled to protection of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.150" offset="618324">Now, it is true that the State when you have commercial speech, can impose reasonable regulations respecting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.347" offset="651134">Here, the estate advances various interests, its principal argument is that preventing in person solicitation, avoids fraud and over-reaching, avoid circumstances in which accountants are might be tempted to say that they would certify financial statements falsely.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.296" offset="738905">Now, we find for the reasons that we expressed in the opinion today that this justifications and others offered by the estate are not advanced in any direct or material way by this solicitation ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.796" offset="796897">And so, we agree with the District Court and the Court of Appeals that this regulation in the context here, in the business context that Fane posits cannot be applied to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.205" offset="858546">It is lawful speech that is being suppressed by the Constitution and this violates the First and the Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.399" offset="891356">We therefore, affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.258" offset="902745">Justice Blackmun has filed a concurring opinion and Justice O'Connor has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
