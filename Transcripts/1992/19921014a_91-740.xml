            <text syncTime="186.565" offset="890175">Another element by which they tried to control the impeachment and removal power was by providing a two-thirds majority had to be present, and another element we think is very important here and brings us here today is that the Senate must conduct the impeachment trial acting in judicial character as a court.</text>

            <text syncTime="253.030" offset="1156101">An ordinary reading of the clause... the Senate shall have the sole power to try impeachments... sole would simply describe the fact that the Senate has the power to try the case, and no other forum has the power to try the case, and that--</text>

            <text syncTime="275.796" offset="1247112">--Well, of course, that's the way the clause was written as it was initially approved, and it was only in the Committee of Style that the word sole was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.433" offset="1277727">It means that the Senate has the power to determine trial procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.335" offset="1297267">Admission of evidence, there are lots of elements of a Senate trial that do not resemble a court trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="295.931" offset="1327673">The Senate has refused to have a standard of proof, and we don't think that would be reviewable, but what does remain reviewable is whether there was a trial at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="305.619" offset="1366439">Well, would it be reviewable, in your view, if a quorum was not present at all times, and could a Senator vote ultimately who had not heard all of the evidence, in your view?</text>
            <text syncTime="320.968" offset="1427879">I mean, what are you getting... asking the Court to get into?</text>

            <text syncTime="324.611" offset="1442403">Your Honor, those are two different questions, I think, and let me try to answer them separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.304" offset="1457136">The question whether a Senator could vote without having heard all the evidence, my answer to that is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.678" offset="1482632">All that's required is that there be a quorum present, and that by definition means you could have as many as 49 Senators not present and those Senators might well vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.255" offset="1520980">Many Senators in the past have asked to be excused from voting if they didn't hear the evidence, but there's no constitutional issue presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.498" offset="1545953">Your initial question, though, was is there a problem if there as not a quorum present, and my answer to that, I think, has to be yes, that that would be the Senate was not duly constituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.298" offset="1597153">If it is in the record that the Senate was not duly constituted and the Senate recklessly went ahead with the trial anyway over the objection of the accused, that would in fact be reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.516" offset="1638008">There you would have no trial actually being held before the Senate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1646.688" offset="6730736">Rule XI of the United States Senate was adopted in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.596" offset="6766367">That rule permits but it does not require the appointment of a committee for a limited function of gathering evidence, and in crafting that rule the Senate was responding to its own experience, because with the growth in that body's responsibilities, at times evidence was being presented before a virtually empty Senate chamber.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.012" offset="6875977">In fashioning that rule, the Senate was exercising a power that was entrusted to it by the Constitution... by Article 1, section 3, clause 6... which vests sole power in the Senate to try all impeachments.</text>

            <text syncTime="1717.638" offset="7014531">--I think that is quite arguably the case, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.457" offset="7029786">I do think, by the way, that the Senate would see fit not to use that procedure with respect to the impeachment of a President or a justice of this Court, and again, I think it's important to know where did this rule come from and why?</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.460" offset="7097809">It was first suggested in 1904, based on experience, a sense on the part of... a felt sense on the part of Senators, some of whom had served in the House of Representatives, had been impeachment managers themselves, and who were sharply critical of the way in which the process was now working.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.504" offset="7177953">And certainly that has been of concern to the Senate since, in 1985, we had the spectacle of a United States district judge who had been duly convicted of a crime, that conviction had been affirmed on appeal, and a suggestion had been made by the Judicial Conference of the United States that impeachment might be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.729" offset="7274919">We have had, unfortunately, three impeachments in recent years, and the Senate has been concerned, therefore, about the orderliness of the proceedings and yet the fairness of the proceedings.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="1796.128" offset="7328522">But General Starr, when that rule was adopted in 1904 according to your opponent here it was contemplated that it would be voluntary on the part of the person being impeached, and indeed, maybe many of them would prefer to be tried by 12 Senators who were there than by 100 who weren't, so one can see why that would have some attraction.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="1822.223" offset="7432803">Justice Scalia, it's fair to say that the Senate was not of one mind with respect to the constitutionality of Rule XI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.600" offset="7466344">There were clearly some Members of the Senate who thought this was improper, and I think, by the way, that's one of the redeeming aspects of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.465" offset="7497796">The Senate has taken this very seriously, has examined the constitutional questions very seriously, and it is true that, as Mr. Stewart has noted, that Senator Ashurst, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 1935 expressed that view, that he contemplated that it would be an optional procedure, but other Senators didn't agree with that, and that certainly is not what the rule itself contemplates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.452" offset="7605734">It's the judgment of the Senate as to whether it's appropriate or not, and particularly given here, in the modern age, where... and this was referred to by Mr. Stewart... we now live in the age where proceedings are videotaped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.292" offset="7665084">These were videotaped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.624" offset="7670413">They were broadcast live, and a full transcript of the proceedings was made available to all of the Senate, and then... this, I think, in terms of what happened here, the argument has thus far been at the level of the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.722" offset="7726837">Let me, if I may, make one very concrete point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.225" offset="7740839">Judge Nixon appeared before the entire United States Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.929" offset="7759647">He answered questions before the entire United States Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.373" offset="7781486">He faced them as his judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.784" offset="7791099">They are not jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.476" offset="7797891">They are Senators who remain Members of the United States Senate who take a constitutional oath and who sit in judgment, and he and his able counsel argued evidentiary points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.066" offset="7856196">And at no point in those proceedings while their motion for a full trial was there... there was no waiver of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.409" offset="7885557">I'm not suggesting this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.781" offset="7891095">But in terms of what happened in these proceedings, not one word was mentioned with respect to invoking that part of Rule XI which permits the Senate to bring specific witnesses before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.501" offset="7957969">In fact, to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.743" offset="7962984">One of the characters who appeared in this unfortunate drama was a lawyer in Hattiesburg named Carroll Ingram.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.859" offset="7991406">In his closing argument, Mr. Stewart said, look at the videotape of Carroll Ingram.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.164" offset="8024633">you will believe Carroll Ingram.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.538" offset="8034142">The Senate sat there with the quorum, with great dignity, asking questions through written questions promulgated by the presiding officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.955" offset="8087745">Not once was the United States Senate urged to bring a specific witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.169" offset="8112614">In fact, the argument presented to the United States Senate in this case was, we want you to go through this mountain of materials, and you will see so many contradictions and testimony by various and sundry witnesses that the case against Judge Nixon falls apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.412" offset="8185652">Let me come back to the theoretical point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.023" offset="8196101">The theoretical point is what impeachment means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.656" offset="8214596">We don't rest our submission on sole power to try.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.749" offset="8238942">We think that is indicative of the Framers' intent, but our submission rests in part on the structure of the Constitution itself and what impeachment means, as well as the fact that the end result of impeachment of an officer of the executive branch or an officer of the judiciary is a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.434" offset="8329744">And the Constitution by its terms contemplates, says that the President, Vice President and all civil officers shall be removed upon conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.214" offset="8392855">As Justice Kennedy put it, how unthinkable it would be for the conviction of a President of the United States to then be subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.331" offset="8437264">The text itself contemplates finality, but more than that, when we go back to the framing we know that what was in the minds of the Framers was a process of checking the civil officers of Government outside the Article I branch.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Overlock Stewart</label>

            <text syncTime="3445.550" offset="13926113">If I might address only a couple of points, quickly, I'm puzzled by the statement by General Starr that the Senate does not sit as a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.016" offset="13964042">Counsel for the Senate, whose... he's co-counsel in this matter, and whom he represents here today, told the Senate in May of 1989 that it sits both as a jury, as a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.290" offset="14001136">That's in the record, and it seems to me that is unavoidable in this case that the Senate sits as a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.325" offset="14025273">I'd like to also address a final point to Justice Kennedy's question on the presidential impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.388" offset="14049515">I would commend to the Court the Twenty-fifth Amendment, which does talk about what you do in a situation where there is a problem with removal of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.906" offset="14087549">I would agree, the removal of the President by the Senate, even inappropriate or unconstitutional removal, means he is no longer President, but there is an opportunity for that to be remedied in the courts, and it does create unwarranted and unhappy ambiguity, but the Twenty-fifth Amendment contemplates that in the case of presidential incapacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.059" offset="14164245">There's weeks when the Congress can review that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.550" offset="14174171">That ambiguity will proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.662" offset="14186606">We don't embrace it, we would lament it, but neither can the Court shrink from deciding the constitutional issue that would be presented.</text>

            <text syncTime="3519.198" offset="14220774">Mr. Stewart, I suppose after these arguments are over the nine of us could go in the back room and just flip a coin or draw straws as to how the decision should come out and it would be promulgated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.866" offset="14271451">That would be wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.757" offset="14275004">It would be unconstitutional.</text>
