            <text syncTime="54.928" offset="361506">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="60.554" offset="384075">This case concerns Federal appellate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.175" offset="402466">The issue is can the United States, by executing on a favorable currency forfeiture judgment, divest a Federal appellate court of appellate jurisdiction to decide the merits of a timely filed appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.705" offset="460666">The Eleventh Circuit below held that the Government had this power, which holding is contrary to the majority of the circuit courts of appeals which have addressed this very issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.242" offset="498805">It is the Government's position in this case that the Government can bring a civil forfeiture lawsuit, win the case at trial, and then prevent an appellate court from deciding the merits of that appeal by transferring the funds in dispute from the territorial jurisdiction of the trial.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="107.053" offset="570067">I suppose, would its position also be that if pending the, pending the decision of the district court the property was sold and the proceeds were transferred to some other place the district court would lose jurisdiction too, I suppose?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stanley A. Beiley</label>
            <text syncTime="125.666" offset="644464">I believe that would follow from the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.247" offset="654808">That's certainly not the position that we advocate before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.540" offset="667974">The late Judge Vance in his dissent in the Eleventh Circuit's One Lear Jet case, which dissent is now the basis for the rule in the majority of the circuits, referred to the majority opinion which adopted the Government's arguments being made before this Court as follows, and I quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.722" offset="740699">It offends fundamental principles of fairness, it represents a departure from common sense, and it is analytically flawed.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.697" offset="776644">We believe Judge Vance's comments are correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.401" offset="791377">It is the bank's position in this case that the Government should not have the power to defeat a Federal court's appellate jurisdiction by its unilateral act of levying on a forfeiture judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.390" offset="843412">We believe that when the Government or any party brings a lawsuit in Federal court that party, as the plaintiff, submits itself to the court's in personam jurisdiction regardless of the nature of the underlying action.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.588" offset="904121">The bank further submits that the nature of the trial court proceeding, whether you call that proceeding in rem, quasi in rem, or in personam, should have no bearing on the issue of Federal appellate jurisdiction.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="204.098" offset="958247">Well, this would be your view even in a classical admiralty action, Mr. Beiley, where everybody agrees it is a prototypical in rem action, nonetheless the Government there would submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the court?</text>

            <text syncTime="221.401" offset="1027419">It's not only my position, Your Honor, but it has been adopted by this Court in several of the cases cited in our brief in a pure admiralty case, the Feckler case, the British transport case, and several prize cases where the Government has intervened in admiralty in rem cases and then objected to cross claims being filed against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.283" offset="1106936">And this Court had held that when the United States intervenes it takes the position of a private suitor for all purposes for which justice may be done.</text>

            <text syncTime="249.139" offset="1138387">Well, is that the same thing though as an admiralty action say initiated by the Government?</text>

            <text syncTime="254.084" offset="1158136">Our position would be it would be the same, Your Honor, that the Government by initiating an action, as well as any plaintiff that initiates an action, submits itself to the court's in personam jurisdiction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="266.583" stopTime="269.274">

            <text syncTime="273.435" offset="1235563">Sovereign immunity we believe would apply to suits against the Government, not to suits by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.191" offset="1258550">In your hypothetical, and Mr. Chief Justice, you asked about the Government initiating a lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.475" offset="1287703">Well, Mr. Beiley, what about cases like the Brig Ann where the court has stated that the release of the res ends jurisdiction?</text>

            <text syncTime="295.011" offset="1321871">--Justice O'Connor, first, we don't believe that ancient admiralty cases should be relevant to an issue of Federal appellate jurisdiction in a currency forfeiture suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.629" offset="1372340">But even under those old admiralty cases, our reading of the cases, I recognize the Government has a contrary interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.173" offset="1402537">Our reading of the traditional old admiralty cases, which we don't believe to be relevant, is that jurisdiction vests upon the initial seizure and that the continuous seizure or the continuous court control of the res, even in the old admiralty cases, is only required in two circumstances, none of which apply here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="334.327" stopTime="341.313">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="334.327" offset="1479128">Well, for example if a third party absconds with the res, what happens then?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stanley A. Beiley</label>
            <text syncTime="341.313" offset="1507027">In a traditional admiralty case if the only way that the court can fashion meaningful relief to the litigants is to have custody of the res and it's essential that that res be before the court to make a meaningful award, then you have this useless judgment exception, as we referred to it in the rules, and the court will not entertain a suit where it can't fashion any meaningful relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.466" offset="1603680">But that's not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.878" offset="1609323">The Government has the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.009" offset="1613816">The Government has had possession of the money from the time this lawsuit started.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.632" offset="1632310">So we don't believe--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="373.844" offset="1637221">Mr. Beiley, you would say that even in the old admiralty cases, I think you would say this, that if the case had already been decided by the district court and was on appeal, as it is here, and at that point somebody absconded with the ship, the appeal would have proceeded, even in old admiralty cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.045" offset="1721963">Wouldn't you say that?</text>
            <text syncTime="395.556" offset="1724052">Do we have a case where that was the situation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stanley_a_beiley" startTime="398.457" stopTime="430.999">
            <label>Mr. Stanley A. Beiley</label>
            <text syncTime="398.457" offset="1735651">--Our position would be if the absence of the ship in the ancient admiralty cases would make any judgment rendered by the appellate court, or on remand the trial court, meaningless, then the court under concepts of mootness or case in controversy could decline jurisdiction and dismiss the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.342" offset="1819138">But again that's not the situation in this case, when the Government has had the money from the inception of the suit, and even under their position has the money today in the Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.629" offset="1852366">Certainly meaningful relief can be fashioned in this case.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="438.354" offset="1895207">I'm saying the old admiralty cases, Justice Scalia, should not have any relevance to currency cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.307" offset="1915060">To the extent they do I think the principles are the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="447.441" offset="1931569">Well, I'm not sure I agree with you that they shouldn't have any relevance.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.341" offset="1939197">Why shouldn't they have any relevance?</text>
            <text syncTime="450.443" offset="1943586">Doesn't Congress, isn't our normal rule that Congress enacts against the background of the common law and we interpret their statutes against that background?</text>

            <text syncTime="466.475" offset="2007742">We interpret that as a position that procedurally you follow admiralty practice in forfeiture cases, but we do not read that as a declaration by Congress that every rule of substantive law that has ever been developed in admiralty cases ipso facto apply in forfeiture cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="534.344" offset="2279207">And you have the right to do that if you wish to put up a bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.808" offset="2289029">Our point though that that's a financial risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.769" offset="2300941">It shouldn't be converted into a jurisdictional risk as the Government would seek to do in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="616.544" offset="2608036">I think the exception in essence highlights the original rule as we interpret the admiralty cases, which is that jurisdiction is complete upon initial seizure unless the removal would make the court's judgment meaningless and worthless because there's no basis to afford the parties relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2719.934" offset="11021555">What the court was concerned about in that case was that there was a clear violation of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.408" offset="11039422">The bond, appeal bond was posted in that case and the court made a great deal of that and said it was clearly contrary to law for the property to be carried off.</text>

            <text syncTime="2751.068" offset="11146106">Our second point is that the United States did not consent to the entry of a judgment in personam when its agents filed an in rem forfeiture proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.463" offset="11187693">Congress has not authorized the entry of a judgment in personam in petitioner's favor, and there is no in rem exception to sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.659" offset="11228444">Third, petitioner's appeal is barred by the appropriations clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.334" offset="11247148">Proceeds of the sale of the res have been deposited in the Treasury and Congress has not appropriated funds to pay a judgment for petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.567" offset="11276092">And finally, there is nothing unfair or unjust about requiring petitioner to take reasonable steps to preserve the court's jurisdiction on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.714" offset="11308692">Appellants are often required to take such steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.197" offset="11322590">Losing claimants can obtain an automatic stay by posting a bond which protects the Government against the costs of an appeal, including the costs of storing the property, and if a losing claimant cannot afford to post a bond the court has discretion to stay the judgment without requiring a bond.</text>

            <text syncTime="2878.080" offset="11654136">And of course this Court has jurisdiction to decide the jurisdictional question, that's properly before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.457" offset="11683602">Petitioner really doesn't contend that it comes within a recognized exception to the jurisdictional rule, but instead argues that this Court should basically jettison the rule that in rem jurisdiction requires the court to control the res.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.631" offset="11760297">We urge the Court to reject that suggestion, which is a radical one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.985" offset="11777747">The rule that the court must control the res in an in rem proceeding serves the important purpose of preventing Federal courts from issuing unenforceable judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.072" offset="11818080">The rule is regularly applied by the courts of appeals, cases cited in our brief including the cases with the, circuits with the greatest familiarity with admiralty such as the Fifth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit, and the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.032" offset="11877953">Moreover, and this is a central point of our position, Congress has legislated in this area on the assumption that the traditional rules of in rem jurisdiction apply in this area unless modified by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.401" offset="11935422">Congress has provided in 28 USC 2461(b) that forfeiture proceedings shall conform as near as may be to in rem proceedings in admiralty unless otherwise provided by act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.709" offset="11996653">Thus the courts are not at liberty to develop one set of jurisdictional rules for forfeiture proceedings and a different set of rules for admiralty cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.657" offset="12032493">And in addition Congress clearly understands the rules of in rem jurisdiction and has shown that it modifies them when it chooses to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.892" offset="12065408">For example, it modified the traditional rule in a customs statute, 19 USC 1605.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.206" offset="12094665">That's discussed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.718" offset="12100725">The purpose of that modification was to alter the traditional rule that Congress understood would otherwise apply, that the res must remain in the judicial district while the in rem procedure was pending.</text>

            <text syncTime="3332.053" offset="13470064">But there's a sovereign immunity problem, there's an appropriations clause problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.478" offset="13487723">If there were a grave injustice in this case perhaps the Court should strain to change the rule, but Congress has demonstrated that it knows about these rules and will change them if it wants to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.898" offset="13549372">In fact Congress is considering legislation right now that's supported by the administration that would change this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.213" offset="13578629">We think that the decision should be left to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.934" offset="13589600">This is, after all, a rule that would have the effect of expanding the limited jurisdiction of Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.479" offset="13615723">And finally, what happened here was not particularly unfair to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.784" offset="13640905">They could have obtained an automatic stay by posting a bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.976" offset="13653757">They didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.907" offset="13657414">They have not offered any excuse for doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.780" offset="13672983">They are wrong in contending that the bond serves no purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.184" offset="13702554">It serves to compensate the Government for the costs of the appeal and the costs of maintaining property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.899" offset="13729408">A lot of these cases involve boats and airplanes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.800" offset="13741006">The costs are quite significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.601" offset="13748216">And it also deters frivolous appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.042" offset="13757933">There is actually, Congress expressly requires a bond, by the way, when an administrative forfeiture proceeding is converted into a judicial forfeiture proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.720" offset="13796699">So Congress doesn't think that a bond is useless when the Government has the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.003" offset="13813835">There is no merit to petitioner's contention that it didn't have enough time to decide whether to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.916" offset="13841525">It had as much time as any criminal defendant has, and in injunction cases there is no automatic stay at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.680" offset="13868588">So some parties are in a worse position than this and have to act immediately to obtain a stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.616" offset="13896278">The Government finds itself in that position in FOIA cases, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.269" offset="13914877">And there is no basis for the speculation that there will be an avalanche of emergency stay applications if the ordinary established rules in in rem proceedings are allowed to continue in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.807" offset="13965032">These are the rules that apply in the Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits, the circuits that have the most experience with admiralty proceedings, and there has been no avalanche of emergency stays or no problem with courts not ruling on the stays in a timely fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.599" offset="14036190">As this Court said in Halstrom against Hillimuck County, the equities do not weigh in favor of petitioners whose procedural default is caused by their failure to take the minimal steps necessary to preserve their claims.</text>
