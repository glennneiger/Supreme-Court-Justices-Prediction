            <text syncTime="8.367" offset="165999">Ms. McKeown.</text>

          <turn speaker="m_margaret_mckeown" startTime="10.068" stopTime="184.311">
            <label>Ms. M. Margaret McKeown</label>
            <text syncTime="10.068" offset="172791">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.561" offset="186792">The issue before you is whether a court reporter who fails to produce a transcript is entitled to absolute judicial immunity, thus overcoming the presumption of qualified immunity which has been found to be sufficient protection for the vast majority of public and Government officials, ranging from presidential aides to the attorney general, other cabinet officers, governors, police officers, and school board members.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.278" offset="293581">We submit that the Ninth Circuit ruling, that the doctrine of judicial immunity bars Mr. Antoine's suit simply because the court reporter is part and parcel of the judicial process, expands the immunity doctrine beyond the Court's decisions and certainly far beyond its historical scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.800" offset="371739">The case comes here in a situation where over 3-year period the court reporter ignored numerous court orders, failed to file the transcript, and, in fact, violated show cause orders from the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.009" offset="428582">Finally, after 3 years, she was unable to produce a complete transcript and a substitute reporter was able to file a reconstructed transcript which was admittedly deficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.927" offset="476229">We ask the Court to rule that a court reporter's function is not adjudicatory, it is not a judicial function, and she is not entitled to absolute immunity from suit for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.788" offset="531713">The circuits are split on this issue, but the answer can be found in the Court's cases on judicial immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.631" offset="563060">The starting point in the immunity analysis is that the presumption is that there is qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.245" offset="593466">So here it's not a question of absolute immunity or nothing, but rather starting with a presumption of qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.693" offset="627321">And because absolute immunity must be granted so sparingly and has generally been regarded as such an extreme measure, there is a very heavy burden on the respondents to justify elevation from qualified to absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.974" offset="696389">No justification exists here.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.357" offset="709973">Certainly, the court reporter doesn't serve a function so special or so sensitive as to require a total shield from liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.810" offset="747798">Nor is the real purpose of judicial immunity, that is preservation of independent decision making, preventing the chilling of making hard and difficult decisions, served in this particular case because, of course, the court reporter makes no such decisions and has no such discretion to chill.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.745" offset="831494">I would like to turn, then, to a discussion of a judicial act and adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.211" offset="861378">The threshold question--</text>

            <text syncTime="184.311" offset="869738">Well, may I interrupt you?</text>
            <text syncTime="185.403" offset="874126">Do you suppose that a judge would have absolute immunity in certifying a case record for appellate review, for example?</text>

            <label>Ms. M. Margaret McKeown</label>
            <text syncTime="197.461" offset="922400">--Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.812" offset="931804">I believe that a judge certifying a record for appellate review is acting in his judicial capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.837" offset="959808">That is a function normally performed by the judge, and that really is an extension... we're assuming a trial judge... of the decision-making process in which the judge has engaged on the trial level.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="218.314" stopTime="238.667">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="218.314" offset="1005783">Although you could certainly say that's a ministerial sort of act, couldn't you?</text>
            <text syncTime="224.329" offset="1029816">What if the trial judge kept notes during that proceedings that became relevant on appeal and they had to be sent up, do you suppose that's part of the judicial act?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="m_margaret_mckeown" startTime="238.667" stopTime="308.682">
            <label>Ms. M. Margaret McKeown</label>
            <text syncTime="238.667" offset="1087181">Let me answer your first question, and that is whether this judge's certification might be deemed to be ministerial.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.513" offset="1114557">And it might; there is not an absolute line that can always be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.864" offset="1132007">But certainly in the case of a judge, one needs to look to the scope of judge's authority, and it's a fairly broad decision-making authority, in contrast to the very limited authority of the court reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.120" offset="1177042">Taking your second situation, and that is assume that the judge makes notes during the process and those are used in some fashion on appeal, it would appear that those notes would be made as part of the decision-making process, not as a part of recording simply a verbatim transcript of what went on in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.606" offset="1262933">So there's a far bigger distinction there between the note taking by the judge, which might be akin to historical note taking by the judge in which he had absolute immunity and was taking notes so that he could comment on the evidence and summarize matters for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.619" offset="1330955">But surely a court reporter is not taking notes as a part of the decision-making process, but rather simply pursuant to statute and court order.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.594" offset="1370871">--So... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.906" offset="1376095">Suppose the judge knowingly keeps on an inept court reporter who's always late, is having health problems, et cetera, and two or three transcripts are delayed or lost, can the judge be sued?</text>

            <text syncTime="373.745" offset="1627498">Because I would suppose... for example, in Justice Kennedy's case, I mean he's posing an example in which the judge's decision is a decision which is made on the administrative rather than the adjudicative side of the dichotomy in his duties, so that if the... if the reporter is negligent and the judge was negligent in keeping the reporter on, I assume there's going to be... could there be respondeat superior negligence here?</text>

            <text syncTime="407.950" offset="1764275">I mean what if the judge simply has an incompetent court reporter and keeps the incompetent court reporter on, and the reporter then causes damages?</text>

            <text syncTime="1104.543" offset="4550704">The other function that those notes served was when the king would go back to the judge for a recommendation on... in a capital case, to ask the judge to go back and look at his notes and make a recommendation as to what kind of sentence or a judgment ought to be passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.389" offset="4630116">So they were never used in the same function that we know today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.272" offset="4649551">And, of course, the notion of a verbatim transcript was not even mandatory in the Federal courts until 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.777" offset="4683615">What we are suggesting is that the threshold question, when one is looking at judicial immunity, is whether their conduct is, in fact, judicial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1327.511" offset="5442524">At this point in time I have to be candid that my client has not himself alleged a State tort action on... there is an amended complaint that was pending, and the amendment was not granted because the case was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.430" offset="5498218">In looking at what is a judicial act, the language in the partial concurrence in Burns v. Reed is really quite helpful, because there it was written that the touchstone of the application of judicial immunity is the function of resolving disputes between the parties, or that is authoritatively adjudicating private rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.614" offset="5591004">So if you take the situation of what does the court reporter do and does she fall into that description, the answer has to be no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.810" offset="5619739">The court reporter, of course, performs a stenographic function, produces a verbatim transcript according to very clear rules, and it's a skilled, but it's a ministerial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.126" offset="5661013">The scope of that activity is hardly in any respect related to the notion of why we have judicial immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.691" offset="5695285">The court reporter exercises no independent judgement, she performs none of the classic adjudicative functions such as evaluation of evidence, like the jury might do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.499" offset="5738544">She has no discretion over the rights of the parties and she does nothing that is really central to this truth seeking which is part of the justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.656" offset="5775115">The central characteristic, then, that is adjudication, is not present with the court reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.349" offset="5801865">Secondly, you ask is it an act normally performed by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.412" offset="5818165">And clearly in the system as we know it now, that is not part of the judge's normal function, that is to take a verbatim transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.955" offset="5848363">Nor could it be said that somehow the court reporter is the judge's alter ego or performs a function which is really comparable to a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.083" offset="5888800">I think that certainly would be a disservice to the judiciary, to suggest that court reporting is functionally comparable to judging.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.849" offset="5923909">And finally, of course, a necessary but not determinative point is to go back to the historical analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.393" offset="5954106">And since there were no court reporters at common law, and on that point I believe both parties are in agreement, the question is then asked was there any comparable function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.790" offset="5991618">And the fact is that there wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.422" offset="5998201">There really was nothing like a verbatim record at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.234" offset="6013457">The note taking was for judicial summing up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.994" offset="6024533">And even those court clerks who had transcripts, and that was basically just a listing of the pleadings, were entitled to no immunity because they were performing ministerial acts under the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.064" offset="6076778">So with those principles in mind, I'd like to turn then to the Ninth Circuit decision and to suggest why that decision is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.349" offset="6109901">Essentially, what the Ninth Circuit did was to grant absolute judicial immunity to anything which is part and parcel of the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.347" offset="6149920">But what that does, basically, is to ignore Forrester, and it really collapses the judicial immunity analysis into an unprecedented association with the judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.312" offset="6193806">The test ought not to be where you sit but what you do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.297" offset="6213659">Also, this would be a blanket extension of the notion of absolute judicial immunity to the entire judicial branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.121" offset="6248977">And as we've learned from other cases such as Harlow, such an undifferentiated extension cannot be reconciled with the functional approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.369" offset="6289937">What it would do, of course, is to place the judiciary in a situation superior to the other two branches of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.873" offset="6320030">Just as the President's immunity cannot be extended in an undifferentiated fashion to his aides, neither can the judiciary's immunity be extended in an undifferentiated fashion to a court reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.074" offset="6376768">Or similarly, even in the legislative context from the Gravel case, legislative acts are not all encompassing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.217" offset="6405398">Finally, what the Ninth Circuit also focused on was that this is a very important part of the overall administration of justice and the efficient administration of justice, and therefore there ought to be absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.617" offset="6462972">And we would take issue with that because that fails to distinguish acts that are important to the judicial system from judicial acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.301" offset="6497662">The answer to that can best be found in the language of Forrester where the Court, talking about administrative acts, says that they might have been quite important in providing necessary conditions of a sound adjudicative system, but the decisions at issue were not themselves judicial or adjudicative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.957" offset="6584389">The second prong of the Forrester test then asks to evaluate what impact would there be were one to grant qualified immunity to court reporters, and what impact would that have on the court reporters' performance of their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.339" offset="6649904">Starting with a premise that qualified immunity is the rule, there's no real reason to place the court reporters in a preferred position above all those other officers mentioned earlier, such as law enforcement officials, presidential aides, who day after day face very difficult, important discretionary decisions, and yet are protected only by qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.465" offset="6754394">And also, the court reporter can hardly be said to fit within the short list of those functions to which this Court has granted absolute immunity: the judge, in the judge's judicial or legislative capacity; jurors, witnesses, and prosecutors taking part in a deliberative evidentiary hearing; the President or legislators and their aides acting as alter egos.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.210" offset="6853346">At this time, if the Court has no objection, I would like to reserve time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1806.652" offset="7359076">My interpretation of the case is... and this is founded in common law, is that judicial immunity essentially comes into play because we felt that judicial immunity had to be, otherwise the process of making decisions of the judicial process would be damaged, would not function as we want it to function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.158" offset="7445176">The question I see here for the Court to resolve, is it necessary to extend that immunity on to a court reporter to accomplish the same goal, and that is an effective judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.497" offset="7498466">So you say do... do we need to extend it on, is it a policy decision?</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.182" offset="7525215">I think it's fair to say it is a policy decision in this respect, as I think that is how judicial immunity arrived.</text>

            <text syncTime="1947.397" offset="7922067">That process up until, as best in the reading I've done on the history... and I think the National Court Reporters Association did an excellent job of reviewing the history... that process was taken care of by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.376" offset="7970028">And I think there was a question here earlier, what about judge's notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.738" offset="7983507">I think the petitioner has diminished the role of those notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.561" offset="7994792">I think they were very important, as my understanding is that the notes and so on were our ability to get to the appellate level with a record and have finality as to the factual issues of the case, so we get to the question of whether the judge complied with the law in making the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.500" offset="8054560">And so I think correct... we need to look at historically.</text>

            <text syncTime="2304.174" offset="9349189">One is simply to restrict what otherwise would be frequent lawsuits, so that the judge or whoever it is won't have to be in court all the time defending his or her actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.112" offset="9396941">And the second is to be sure that in order to avoid lawsuits, the judge or whoever it is does not... does not shrink from making the tough calls, the tough decisions, the jury from calling it the way the jury really saw it, or the judge from coming out against somebody who is a... an habitual litigant and would sue anybody in sight.</text>

            <text syncTime="2901.275" offset="11737617">If there is the potential threat, the creation of mistrust within the courtroom personnel, I think you have defeated to some degree the purpose of judicial immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.864" offset="11791951">Now, whether that's a few cases that come out or whether it's a floodgate of opening of cases, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.319" offset="11825806">But I do think that the dangers that flow from it are there whether there's few or many.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.502" offset="11846495">The three areas that I wanted to touch on, and I think they have been touched on in the questioning that have been posed, is, one, historical, that I think the court reporter's role is part of the historical duties and responsibilities of the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.777" offset="11935625">The other is the role of the court reporter, and I wanted, I felt in representing respondent in this case, to emphasize what the court reporter's role was in a trial, what it really meant in the day-to-day trial of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.538" offset="11994662">And third, the consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.229" offset="12005424">And looking at the consequences would have been discussed, it seems to me that they are serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.264" offset="12033532">And I don't think it has to do with how many cases are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.755" offset="12047533">But once you open the door and start to allow factual inquiry, which may well happen in this case depending on the rule of the Court... as once you open the door and say what went on in the courtroom with regard to the court reporter that is a factual question, then I think you are defeating judicial immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3025.855" offset="12235929">In a sense, it seems to me your addressing a question that's moot in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3051.244" offset="12337493">Let me address briefly the threat of litigation and then the historical issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.670" offset="12363197">On the threat of litigation, there are four circuits which hold for qualified immunity and there are also district courts in three other circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.884" offset="12396007">The result has not been a flood of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.698" offset="12407292">We disagree with opposing counsel that there is some significant threat, and I would turn again back to Westfall where the Court noted that where conduct is not the product of independent threat, then the threat of liability cannot detrimentally inhibit that function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.398" offset="12474061">Turning to the historical section, we are in disagreement that the judge's note taking was in any way comparable to what the court reporter does, and refer to the 1978 and 1983 articles of Professor Langbein.</text>
