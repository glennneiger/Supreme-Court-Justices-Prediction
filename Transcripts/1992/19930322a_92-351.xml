            <text syncTime="49.903" offset="342613">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.509" offset="369048">May it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="57.994" offset="375004">This is a civil rights action brought under 42 U.S.C., section 1983 by Respondents, who in this case are Sammy Doe and the class that he represents, to challenge the procedures utilized in the Commonwealth of Kentucky for admission of mentally retarded persons to the residential facilities operated by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.159" offset="451595">The record contains more than 10 years of history of the State's efforts to comply with the requirements established by the courts below for those admissions procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.277" offset="504049">At the time the litigation began all admissions to the State's facilities were done on a voluntary basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.039" offset="539158">The applications for admission were made by the local community health centers who had certified to the State that there were no less restrictive provisions available for the mentally retarded person.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.814" offset="602270">There was nothing that was available for them in the community, and the State reviewed those applications by and through a... what they call a records review committee, which was a group of qualified mental health professionals or mental retardation professionals, to determine, in fact, whether or not the individual could best be served in one of the State's facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.525" offset="681055">If that committee determined that they could be so served to determine which facility the person would be placed in, the person was put on a waiting list, and when a space became available, they were then admitted to the facility on the application or signature of their guardian.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.080" offset="747301">The guardian provided the substituted informed consent for the admission, and the admission was treated as voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.405" offset="776559">The individual then had the right to be released at any time upon his or her request or upon the request of the guardian.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.903" offset="802577">The initial decision of the district court reviewed those procedures, found that those procedures were in keeping with the procedures required by the Constitution except an additional procedure that the State had informally adopted which permitted the parents of mentally retarded children to essentially veto a decision or recommendation to place the children from a facility into a community setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.503" offset="897035">Upon reconsideration--</text>

            <text syncTime="322.965" offset="1434844">After holding lengthy hearings concerning what the needs of that group of people were, they adopted what's called House bill 511, and it's printed in the appendix in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.510" offset="1469013">That new statute was challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.616" offset="1485417">Two parts of it were found to be unconstitutional, one dealing with the standard of proof, which would be required for the involuntary commitment of mentally retarded persons to the State's facilities; the other provisions dealing with the participation in the involuntary commitment proceedings of the parents, guardians, and immediate family members of the mentally retarded.</text>

            <text syncTime="379.130" offset="1659497">The reason that the State adopted these procedures, one of the primary reasons, was because the courts had held that the State could no longer treat admissions through this record review process and upon the substituted consent of guardians as voluntary admissions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1594.141" offset="6519527">The argument before the Court today is twofold that presents simply issues of equal protection and due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.357" offset="6548366">First, in looking at the equal protection argument, Kentucky would treat persons with mental retardation differently from the mentally ill in the involuntary commitment process without any constitutionally adequate reason for the differing treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.898" offset="6610537">They've had 11 years since this case was filed in 1982 to come up with a reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="1623.378" offset="6636451">What about the reason that Mr. Moore gave in answer to Justice Scalia's question, that if, in fact, it's easier to make a diagnosis of the mentally retarded than it is of the mentally ill, that justifies a difference in the burden of proof because you're less likely to make a mistake with one than you are with the other?</text>

            <text syncTime="1654.804" offset="6762152">This case... this Court recognized in Cleburne that mentally retarded persons are all not cut from the same pattern, that they have wide-ranging capabilities and abilities, that at one end of the spectrum, they need care and constant attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.485" offset="6816905">At the other end, they're not easily distinguishable as being mentally retarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.359" offset="6836444">So, in that regard, we would say mentally retarded as a group themselves are widely varied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1707.736" offset="6973953">Because what Foucha was dealing with is exactly what we're dealing here, a fundamental interest at stake, a massive curtailment of liberty that this Court had recognized as early as Humphrey v. Cady and in Addington and O'Connor, and most recently last year in the plurality opinion of Foucha.</text>

            <text syncTime="1734.211" offset="7079801">In fact, in the joint appendix, Dr. Skarnulis, who's Director of Community Services for the mentally retarded, had said that these are restrictive placements.</text>

            <text syncTime="1756.279" offset="7168095">The State has such a standard here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1805.118" offset="7363491">For purposes of the burden of proof, we have never argued that due process requires more than clear and convincing under Addington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.538" offset="7393166">But what we're saying and in looking at the cases of Baxtrom and Cleburne and the equal protection analysis, that there has to be a reason, and that reason is going to have to be more important as what's at stake is more important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.361" offset="7440395">And what we have here at stake is a massive curtailment of liberty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1873.606" offset="7637359">One, in 1990 when they did lower the standard of proof for the mentally retarded, they in fact tried for the mentally ill and could not succeed, the reason being that Addington talks about burden of proof being more than an empty semantic exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.649" offset="7689604">What it is is it's a value that society is placing on that person's individual liberty that's at risk, and if Kentucky is going to place that value, that high of a value, for the mentally ill, why should they not do it for the mentally retarded without some good reason... a good reason?</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.001" offset="7755014">And under Foucha, we would say that they would have to have a particular convincing reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.437" offset="7768702">What the State is saying and has said in their brief is in their perspective, that these people are in need of treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.591" offset="7797333">We would dispute that overriding vision that they've given the Court today that this is why we're committing these people because the record reflects in Dr. Skarnulis' deposition that 1 person in an institution, no matter how profound or severe... for that 1 person, there are 10 in Kentucky in the community living with the needed support services.</text>

            <text syncTime="3251.755" offset="13150031">They don't get to the hearing phase until first the petition is filed, the probable cause hearing is held by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.502" offset="13173019">The court then appoints two qualified mental retardation professionals, one of whom must be a doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.359" offset="13196425">Those persons must evaluate, conduct an evaluation of the mentally retarded person immediately within 24 hours, and certify both of them to the court that the person is mentally retarded and that they do meet the criteria for involuntary admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.666" offset="13249610">If those certifications are not filed, if the professionals do not agree, then the petition is dismissed.</text>
