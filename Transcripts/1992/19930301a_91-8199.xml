            <text syncTime="17.104" offset="198474">Thomas Lee Deal, the petitioner, committed six bank robberies in the Houston, Texas area during a 4-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.755" offset="225119">In addition to being found guilty and sentenced for those bank robberies he was found guilty and sentenced for six counts of using a firearm during a crime of violence and for being a felon in possession of a weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.025" offset="278200">At issue in this case is whether Mr. Deal was given notice that he would receive 20-year sentences on five of the six counts for using a firearm during a crime of violence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 924(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="54.026" offset="346223">Mr. Deal contends that his Fifth Amendment due process rights were violated because the rule of lenity was not applied when imposing the 20-year sentences under section 924(c).</text>

            <text syncTime="78.542" offset="444234">So for that reason petitioner is asking this Court to construe the statute as imposing a 20-year sentence only if the offense is committed after a previous 5-year sentence has been, has become final.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.602" offset="508496">Such a construction is necessary because the language of section 924(c), specifically in the case of his second or subsequent conviction, is ambiguous for several reasons when both the language of the statute and the structure and operation of the statute are considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.386" offset="579653">Turning to the language of the statute, the specific language at issue has two meanings, one of two meanings.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.873" offset="609537">It can be construed as multiple convictions occurring at the same time, or it can be construed as multiple convictions occurring in chronological sequence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1895.635" offset="7712649">Under this statute even a first crime carries a mandatory penalty of 30 years imprisonment if the firearm used is equipped with a silencer, if it is a machine gun, or under the most recent changes, if the firearm is a bomb or any similar explosive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.376" offset="7783598">And Congress has made a judgment that those types of activities are so dangerous that even someone who does that only once, and for the very first time in his life, should be subject to the 30-year mandatory sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.275" offset="7839186">We think that the second or subsequent clause that immediately follows is written in the same vein, and simply seeks to identify a particularly dangerous class of criminals, those who would use a gun to do a crime more than once and who thereby place at risk the lives of other people every time they do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.410" offset="7919748">What Congress in effect is saying to those persons is if you are the type of person who would do a crime with a gun more than once you are just too dangerous to have around and you must be separated and incapacitated from society.</text>

            <text syncTime="2779.392" offset="11247643">We think that our submission as to the meaning of the statute is also reinforced by the history of section 924(c) because, as this Court indicated in Busic and in Lewis, the Gun Control Act of 1968 in general and section 924(c) specifically were passed in 1968 in response to an unprecedented wave of assassinations, riots, and violent crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.595" offset="11388496">Since 1968 Congress repeatedly has thought, sought, excuse me, to turn the screw on armed violent crime, to single out those instances of armed conduct that give rise to intolerable risks to human life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.407" offset="11459758">By and large the changes that Congress has made to the scope of the statute since 1968 or to the scale of its penalties, including its 1984 decision to change the result in Busic, manifest an attitude not of leniency but of increasing severity toward this very serious problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.563" offset="11560381">The second or subsequent clause in our view is a plain dangerous person statute and is not different from those other steps that Congress has taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.263" offset="11623180">With the sole exception of the Tenth Circuit, every court of appeals to consider the issue that is raised here has discerned Congress' intent from the clear language of section 924(c), and because that language is indeed clear we ask that the Court affirm the judgement of the Fifth Circuit.</text>
