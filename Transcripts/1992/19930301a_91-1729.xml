            <text syncTime="11.760" offset="187939">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.281" offset="201941">This case involves the question whether the United States retains its long-standing common law right to collect prejudgment interest on debts owed by state and local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.668" offset="243528">The case arises in the context of the Federal Food Stamp Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.101" offset="257321">Under that program the United States distributes food stamps to participating states for issuance to eligible individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.304" offset="286055">States like Texas that choose to distribute food stamps through the mail are contractually liable to the United States for a portion of the value of the food stamps that are lost or stolen in the mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.572" offset="331195">In 1986 and 1987 the United States asserted claims against Texas amounting to over $400,000 for losses arising out of the State's issuance of food stamps in the mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.149" offset="377484">Both the district court and the court of appeals upheld the validity of those claims, but the court of appeals also held that the United States was not entitled to collect prejudgment interest on the State's debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.657" offset="427535">We submit that the court of appeals erred in reaching that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.250" offset="441850">As this Court has repeatedly indicated, an award of prejudgment interest is in keeping with fundamental principles of fairness and equity and serves to insure that neither party to a dispute benefits or suffers from a delay in payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.261" offset="501931">For those reasons the right of the United States to collect prejudgment interest from the states and from local governments has long been recognized as a matter of Federal common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.838" offset="540175">Respondents argue that Congress intentionally abrogated that long-standing common law right when it enacted the Debt Collection Act of 1982, but the language and purpose of that act and traditional canons of statutory construction require rejection of respondents' argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.478" offset="610810">The language of the Debt Collection Act does not address the question at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.052" offset="633066">The act says only that states are not persons for purposes of the mandatory prejudgment interest and delinquency penalty provisions of 31 U.S.C. section 3717.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.479" offset="678832">Standing alone, that exclusion from the scope of section 3717 does not suggest that Congress intended to go further and to abrogate the existing common law remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.575" offset="723136">The common law remedy is discretionary and flexible and allows courts to weigh the interests of the state better in determining whether and to what extent to award prejudgment interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="158.485" offset="774859">If the state had just refused to pay, Mr. Hungar, and the United States had sued the state, which was not the case here, would it have had a choice to proceed under the Federal common law or under the Debt Collection Act, or does the Debt Collection Act not provide some substantial cause of action?</text>

            <text syncTime="178.207" offset="853644">In this case the United States would not have had the choice to proceed under the Debt Collection Act because the Debt Collection Act's prejudgment interest remedy expressly excludes the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="196.802" offset="928041">It just, it sets forth certain remedies and certain specific contexts for the Federal Government's debt collection efforts.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.106" offset="1017275">The substantive cause of action comes from the Food Stamp Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="222.148" offset="1029500">Would the... and is that the common law cause of action that the United States would proceed under in this hypothetical case where the United States is initiating the suit?</text>
            <text syncTime="232.984" offset="1072759">Would the United States then have a choice to say well, we'll proceed under the statutory cause of action or under the Federal common law, or are they the same thing?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_g_hungar" startTime="239.910" stopTime="289.031">
            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Hungar</label>
            <text syncTime="239.910" offset="1100553">Well, if we're referring to the Federal common, the Federal cause of action, which is a different question than the remedy for prejudgment interest in our view, the cause of action... I am sure the United States would have a cause of action that could either be viewed as an implied right of action under the Food Stamp Act or as the more general Federal cause of action for money had and received, which is at issue in the United States against California case.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.319" offset="1218104">But in either event we would submit that prejudgment interest would be available under the separate remedial rule that this Court has repeatedly affirmed, which is that where a sum of money is owing to the United States prejudgment interest is generally available, depending on the equities of the particular situation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="289.031" stopTime="301.459">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="289.031" offset="1296994">So if in the hypothetical case you had proceeded under the statutory authority to collect the money, the Debt Collection Act is still not applicable insofar as prejudgment interest is concerned?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Hungar</label>
            <text syncTime="331.448" offset="1466686">We believe it could, Your Honor, but it might, depending on the equities of the particular situation, if there had been some undue delay perhaps then it would be inequitable to impose liability prior to that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.466" offset="1506705">The court could determine that the date of the complaint would be the first date from which interest would accrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.490" offset="1530842">I would think the general rule, though, would be that interest begins accruing once the debt is liquidated and owing.</text>

            <text syncTime="366.442" offset="1606597">So that the State of Texas I take it then in your view is wrong in what it said in its brief on, I think it was on page 12, that what the Government is asking for here in fact is the same interest remedy that it would have had under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.502" offset="1666888">It's not the same kind of remedy, I take it.</text>

            <text syncTime="384.406" offset="1678486">The common law remedy is quite distinct and different from the statutory remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="391.089" offset="1705236">It requires courts to impose prejudgment interest at a specified mandatory minimum statutory rate, which is not true of the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.155" offset="1733448">It requires collection of processing fees and delinquency penalties in appropriate cases, which is not true of the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.399" offset="1758421">It applies to more debts or more obligations than does the common law remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.359" offset="1774303">And the biggest distinction is the fact of course that the statute is mandatory on the courts, the common law has discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1769.846" offset="7220207">It's only two sections that are taken out and removed as not applying to states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.038" offset="7241001">3701(c) says that for purposes of sections 3716 and 3717 the state is not a person, obviously leaving the state a person for every other section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.956" offset="7296694">So it's not a case in which Congress has simply chosen not to address the states at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.160" offset="7321458">Secondly, the Debt Collection Act comprehensively addresses the question of prelitigation debt collection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1841.149" offset="7505464">Before 1982 there was what was called the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, and some of these provisions, some parts of 3701 and 3702, and as Mr. Hungar just mentioned, 3714, were in that preexisting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.844" offset="7584250">What the Debt Collection Act did was greatly expand the scope and really limit the discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.971" offset="7620717">One of the most important things it did was to reduce the discretion of Federal agencies as to whether to seek debt, as to when to seek debt, as to how to seek debt collection, and from whom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.558" offset="7667110">Now, it happens that in 3701(c) as to administrative offsets and charging interest, Congress removed discretion altogether from the Federal agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.465" offset="7718728">But the... as has been brought out by questioning previously, we have a confusion here of two different points at which interest may be sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.301" offset="7754046">The Debt Collection Act deals with prelitigation debt collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.734" offset="7775779">In fact the original caption back in the Federal Claims Collection Act said in order to avoid unnecessary litigation the following procedures are enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.522" offset="7818934">In prelitigation assessing interest, asking the state to pay interest, that's what the states have been removed from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.678" offset="7859580">Now it's interesting to look at this case and see how this putative common law authority was exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.113" offset="7885285">You'll see in the Joint Appendix, starting around page 6, the notice letters which the Secretary of Agriculture sent, really making a demand on the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.999" offset="7928857">It calculates a very precise interest, 7.625 percent, and it says that that's based on regulation 102.11.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.165" offset="7965533">102.11 then refers to 102.13, which is the one Mr. Hungar was discussing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.799" offset="7992073">That 102.13 incorporates almost verbatim the provisions of 3717.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.146" offset="8021435">What happened in this case was the Secretary of Agriculture treated the Texas Department of Human Services exactly the way the state would have been treated if 3717 had been made by Congress to apply to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.105" offset="8085278">So the effect of allowing this putative common law right is to read right back into the prelitigation debt collection process exactly the coverage of the state, local, and Federal government which Congress excluded.</text>

            <text syncTime="2152.936" offset="8752655">And there is a formula for how they assess it, it has to do with Treasury rates, rates on Treasury notes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2238.020" offset="9092978">Once the Justice Department is in court on behalf of the Federal Government in litigation with the State, it has available under its authority an arsenal of remedies or tools that it can use which hasn't really been a subject of this litigation thus far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.784" offset="9183988">I think the City of Milwaukee v. Illinois case in '81, and it sort of was a companion case to Northwestern Airlines v.

            <text syncTime="2284.129" offset="9277402">And I think that's a good starting point for analysis to then take a look and see what the Debt Collection Act has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.864" offset="9304361">That case reminded litigants that Federal common law is not like the common law, the body of common law that the state courts by and large have developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.582" offset="9351172">It's called common law because judges use a common law type of decision making process, but it's a limited stop gap measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.880" offset="9392341">It only arises in the situation where the Federal court needs to make a decision on a question, there is no Federal statute to guide it, and it's not appropriate to look to state common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.727" offset="9439779">In those limited instances then the Federal courts can fashion a sort of common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.660" offset="9459528">But as City of Milwaukee said, as soon as Congress has directly addressed the question covered by the common law, then the need for the common law disappears.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.717" offset="9499757">So that begs the question what does it take for Congress to directly address a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.561" offset="9523162">The decision goes on again, this is really a reminder of what had been the law all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.763" offset="9547926">It doesn't have to say expressly by this statute we intend to displace Federal common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.849" offset="9576243">In fact in none of the briefs in this case, in none of the circuit decisions, there are about 6 circuits that have addressed the question that we're here talking about today, has anybody cited an example of a statute where Congress has expressly said by this statute Congress hereby abrogates common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.611" offset="9655342">Now Congress does have to do that sort of thing in other contexts, like for example to abrogate a state's Eleventh Amendment immunity when it creates a private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.258" offset="9693899">It has to say, and this Court has told Congress it has to say this abrogates Eleventh Amendment immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.933" offset="9720648">But it doesn't have to do that, according to City of Milwaukee and cases since then, when it's displacing common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.926" offset="9744576">It doesn't owe Federal common law the same deference it owes state common law, and it doesn't take as much as it does to preempt state law under the Interstate Commerce Clause, and yet a number of statutes can preempt state law without saying so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.238" offset="9813853">To look and see whether it has directly addressed the question, this City of Milwaukee, and another helpful case is United States v. Fausto, said you look at the, not only the purpose of the statute but its scope and the structure of its remedial scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.722" offset="9899743">Now as to the purpose, obviously 3701(c) is an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.037" offset="9925030">It is an exception, so in a sense you can say any time a statute makes an exception, having made a broad across the board rule, any time it comes back and says but we except, we exclude these categories, you can say that's contrary to the purpose, but it isn't really in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.788" offset="10000054">It's not at all unusual for Congress to choose to treat one class of debtors differently, governmental parties differently from others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.036" offset="10041014">And what Congress has done in 3701(c) is consciously choose to treat governmental debtors differently from other debtors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.260" offset="10073928">For example, under this Food Stamps Act, if grocer submits food stamps to the Federal Government for reimbursement at face value and the Federal Government delays in repaying, it doesn't have to pay interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.101" offset="10141219">It's very common to find that governments don't have to pay interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.073" offset="10161177">What you have as a countervailing incentive, disincentive to the state to unreasonably delay is a unique sort of relationship which state agencies have with their Federal funding agencies that the ordinary debtor doesn't have to a creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.025" offset="10228991">The Texas Department of Human Resources, Services, excuse me, receives Federal funding from Agriculture and Health and Human Services.</text>

            <text syncTime="2686.502" offset="10886859">I would agree that that's an instance in which a governmental entity does not pay interest and whereas another, someone else who has an obligation to pay somebody back in which there has been an overpayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.192" offset="10945686">And this is sort of that sort of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.774" offset="10955926">Under the Food Stamps Act what the Government is saying is that money has been paid which the Government should not have had to pay, and therefore the State of Texas should refund or reimburse the Federal Government a portion of that money which the Federal Government should not have had to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.539" offset="11043071">And so it's a similar sort of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.542" offset="11066999">Congress has chosen, has made a very obvious policy choice that governmental debtors, including... and by the way that 3701(c) includes the United States Government as well, and subchapter 3 of the Debt Collection Act are claims against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.865" offset="11144321">So it runs both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.456" offset="11154666">As to the deference that would be due to the interpretation by these Federal agencies, I think that the case which answers the question that took place in the dialogue earlier is Securities and Exchange Commission v. the Chenery Corporation, which I think both parties have cited in their briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.012" offset="11244945">In that case the SEC wanted to penalize the managers during reorganization of a corporation for having purchased preferred stock in the reorganized corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.090" offset="11297190">They relied for that ruling not on their specialized expertise that had been delegated to them by Congress of stock transaction, but the SEC's understanding of general principles of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.078" offset="11345151">What the court said was fine, in the usual situation where an agency's ruling or decision or interpretation is in an area of law delegated to it by Congress and in which it has specialized expertise we defer, but when the agency is purporting to rely on judicial doctrines, then a court can and should substitute its judgment for the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.304" offset="11446088">It's very clear in this case, in fact the best indication of it is in the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.218" offset="11473778">I think around page 21 they discuss, the comptroller specifically considered whether common law applied and decided that the common laws in force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.716" offset="11515783">Now they're relying not on something that's within the specialized expertise of the comptroller general, now what the Government is doing is giving its understanding of when common law retains viability in the face of an explicit statute, and that of course is a matter of judicial doctrine and I think that the same deference would not be due.</text>

            <text syncTime="3223.423" offset="13034542">Well, if it's give any deference, in my 50-50 case we give the nod to the agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="3229.377" offset="13058366">If you conclude, Your Honor, if the Court concludes that this is a very, very close call and it's extremely unclear, and furthermore that this is an agency which has traditionally exercised this common law right, then the deference is greater than what I am suggesting is actually the situation where the statute has been, first where the statute has... first of all comprehensively addressed the situation of prelitigation debt collection, seeking to collect debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.132" offset="13197441">And it's, I think it's all encompassing in that regard, as the Court found the Federal Water Pollution Act to be with regard to discharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.319" offset="13242163">It applies to every Federal agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.399" offset="13250418">It sets the, it makes every Federal agency have the same policy and the same procedure and give the same priority to seeking to collect debts owed to the United States as every other agency, which was not the situation previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.341" offset="13314261">So it's pretty comprehensive in that sphere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.343" offset="13326277">Having occupied that sphere, Congress made a judgment... now, the legislative history won't tell you the articulated reasons because this was added on the floor of the Senate after the bill came there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.971" offset="13384792">All we have is the post-enactment statement, so we have to... but you can see by the mechanics of the statute they had to, this had to have been deliberate to say, to add a subsection to the definitions section to say that persons in 3716 and 3717 doesn't include states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.404" offset="13470473">That had to be very conscious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.377" offset="13478415">As to the utility of leaving in place the, quote, discretionary and flexible type of common law interest as some sort of a supplement to the act while removing states from the mandatory provisions, I'll just return to the point that as a practical matter the agency has applied its putative common law authority to the State of Texas exactly the way 3717 would have been applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.766" offset="13599936">They have sent the same kind of notice, they have started the interest accruing at the same point, 30 days, and they have used exactly the same formula to compute the rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.612" offset="13639329">So from our standpoint it's the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="3383.880" offset="13676423">I mean, the Government has to bill you something if there is interest owing, right, because it wouldn't know whether the debt has been fulfilled or not?</text>

            <text syncTime="3392.033" offset="13709023">That would be the way it would, if they have to have, if they have to charge interest I would say that, as I was saying earlier, the one thing that distinguishes the relationship of the Federal recipient agency with the Federal funding agency from other types of creditor-debtor relations is this ongoing relationship that they have and the need that they have to maintain good relations with the... the states are simply not defaulting on their debts, and this is clear from the Senate report 97-378 which both parties have cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.191" offset="13861683">When you look at what Congress found as to who is deficient and who is not, they're really not talking about a big problem with states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.315" offset="13898150">States are obviously some part of the problem, but they're not a big problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.578" offset="13915182">So Congress could very well decide let's remove discretion with regard to the states and focus the Federal agencies on going in a more aggressive manner after the debt which the others have owed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.159" offset="13981533">I believe this discussion covers the really major points and major cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3478.921" offset="14056557">From United States v. West Virginia you have to go all the way back to 1939, Board of Commissioners v. the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.558" offset="14095113">That was really a suit against a county, and although the United States brought it, the United States through the Bureau of Indian Affairs was really bringing it on behalf of a native American, and really the outcome of that case was based on the fact that really the United States Government's position there was equivalent to any other individual who was due a tax refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.043" offset="14181004">So the United States, although it's implicit if the Federal Government can sue a county, and although they didn't get interest in Board of Commissioners it apparently was one of their remedies, you might say it's implicit, but really West Virginia v. United States in 1987 is the first time it was said expressly.</text>
