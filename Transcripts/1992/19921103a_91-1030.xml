            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="141136">We'll hear argument next in Number 91-1030, Pamela Withrow v. Robert Allen Williams, Jr. Mr. Caminsky, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="jeffrey_caminsky" startTime="32.369" stopTime="217.639">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey Caminsky</label>
            <text syncTime="32.369" offset="270599">For the last seven or eight hundred years, the writ of habeas corpus has been one of the Crown Jewels in Anglo-American jurisprudence, providing a measure of protection for all who share the heritage of the English common law from tyranny and oppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.349" offset="346458">In this case, I submit to the Court that we have in front of us today a classic example of the extent to which habeas corpus has strayed from its original and intended purposes and gives us a paradigm of a Federal district court employing a writ of habeas corpus as a writ of Federal error.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.131" offset="437574">If we take a look at the record of this case, we see that before his arraignment respondent made three separate statements to the police, the first statement being severable into two separate parts, a pre-Miranda segment and a post-Miranda segment.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.343" offset="518449">Prior to trial, the respondent moved to suppress all three statements on various grounds relating to the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments, and actually prevailed concerning two of those statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.602" offset="571529">The only statement that the State trial judge admitted into evidence was the first statement rejecting the respondent's claim that it was obtained unlawfully and in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.612" offset="635582">In a State court appeal, the respondent chose to appeal on matters relating to this particular statement only on grounds related to the Miranda issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.872" offset="688558">The State Court of Appeals in Michigan denied his appeal and issued an opinion affirming his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.977" offset="720950">The respondent then filed an application to the Michigan Supreme Court which denied review and ultimately filed a petition for writ of certiorari to this Court which was denied back in 1989.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.885" offset="776643">Respondent then went to Federal district court, filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.856" offset="800467">Again, as far as this particular statement is concerned, respondent raised only the Miranda issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.926" offset="832754">In her opinion granting the writ, however, the Federal district judge not only sustained his Miranda claim, in effect overruling the finding of the State court that the police had done nothing wrong, but also went on to find the second half of that statement, the post-Miranda statement, and actually both of the other statements that had been suppressed in the State trial court, to be involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.231" offset="953962">We appealed to the Sixth Circuit, and while finding parts of the district court's opinion slightly inexplicable, the court nevertheless issued an opinion affirming, and that is what brings us here today.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="217.639" offset="1011640">Did you complain in the Fifth Circuit, Mr. Caminsky, about the district court's taking up the involuntariness issue as well as the Miranda issue?</text>

            <text syncTime="227.762" offset="1052183">Yes, we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.346" offset="1054481">In fact, in the Sixth Circuit I tried to draw a clear distinction between the Miranda claim and a claim of involuntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.202" offset="1085933">I think there are clear precedents from this Court under the Quarles case and Harris v. New York and a number of others where this Court has drawn a distinction between Miranda defects and Miranda claims and claims of involuntariness, and that was one of the things that I tried to point out in the Sixth Circuit, apparently not as well as I would have hoped, because in any event they rejected that particular position, and in fact--</text>

            <text syncTime="264.903" offset="1200663">--Did you object that the involuntariness claim had never been raised in the district court?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey Caminsky</label>
            <text syncTime="272.041" offset="1229293">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.375" offset="1230547">We... in a number of points in our brief, what we tried to do was draw a distinction between the Miranda claim and the involuntariness claim, and we even noted in our brief in the Sixth Circuit that this issue was not before the district court not only because of the failure of exhaustion but because it had never been raised in the petition for writ of certiorari, so it is a little bit mystifying how we got to the point of having to argue both the question of voluntariness and the question of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.465" offset="1378922">The Sixth Circuit, however, also drew no distinction between the Miranda claim and the involuntariness claim, and that is one of the points that we're here to address today.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.189" offset="1417792">In fact, it seems to me that in many respects the narrowest holding that this Court could issue, and perhaps the core of this case, is simply the application of Stone v. Powell to Miranda claims, and there are a number of different ways this Court can go about that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="336.049" stopTime="342.805">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="336.049" offset="1485293">Well, is one of your questions in your petition the failure to exhaust?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey Caminsky</label>
            <text syncTime="342.805" offset="1512356">Yes, it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.090" offset="1529492">I think in terms of helping the analysis, it may help us to divide what we commonly consider to be constitutional claims into three different classifications, three different classes of claimed constitutional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.516" offset="1591141">The first claim would be matters of fundamental fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.837" offset="1612457">Justice Cardozo in Palko v. Connecticut wrote a rather interesting opinion outlining his conception of what fundamental fairness was, and basically this Court has issued opinions of similar import in recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.065" offset="1681316">Teague v. Lane, for example, would even apply retroactive changes in the law in habeas review in certain cases relating--</text>

            <text syncTime="393.820" offset="1716320">Well, if you really raised the exhaustion claim and we agreed with you, why, that would be the end of the case, wouldn't it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey Caminsky</label>
            <text syncTime="420.405" offset="1822690">--See, this is one of the points of some confusion in the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.475" offset="1847036">If the Court examines the Sixth Circuit Appendix it will see that the respondent in his State court appeal appeared through his statement of the question to be raising only a question of the State constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.883" offset="1904610">At the time in Michigan there was a question relating to focus and custody in terms of triggering mechanism for Miranda warnings, and in large part his argument in the State court related to that issue, and I had originally challenged the Miranda claim on the question of exhaustion as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.546" offset="1983291">Upon reflection, it seemed that there was enough language in his State court appellate brief to raise the Federal part of the Miranda issue as well, and therefore I think that part of it is exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.723" offset="2044000">But I would... I would--</text>

            <text syncTime="481.044" offset="2065211">--Yes, I do, for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.977" offset="2072943">I mean, part of the reason is because of the particular classification that Miranda would fall into, and we have questions of fundamental fairness of basic due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.249" offset="2114112">There's another class that I would consider to be the Federal criminal constitutional procedural-type guarantees that this Court has adopted through its incorporation document.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.358" offset="2170537">The last class would be constitutional claims relating to rules of deterrence, or rules of peripheral access, and that is the type of claim that Miranda is, and it seems to me that if you take the logic of Stone v. Powell and apply it to the particular fact situations that are likely to occur in a Miranda case, that the legal parallels are rather compelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.624" offset="2263533">And in fact, as Justice O'Connor noted in her concurring opinion in Duckworth, it seems to be even more compelling in the Miranda context because we're not really dealing with an actual violation of the Constitution, we're simply dealing with a violation of the rule that this Court has designed to create a buffer around the actual constitutional violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1378.686" offset="5655794">The exclusionary rule, after all, prevents the State from taking advantage of a constitutional violation in every case in which it applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.406" offset="5686723">Miranda sweeps more broadly than the Constitution, so we think the rule of Stone v. Powell should apply a fortiori, and with respect to the significance, the practical impact, it's noteworthy I think that 36 State Attorneys General have filed an amicus brief in this case suggesting that they regard the impact as significant in terms of the respect accorded by the Federal system to the finality of State court judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.723" offset="5784003">Now, turning to the voluntariness question in this case, the statements that were made after the Miranda warnings were given and waived, the totality of the circumstances shows this: we had a lucid individual not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, not too young to be susceptible to police influence, a veteran of police procedures... he knew the jargon.</text>

            <text syncTime="1603.789" offset="6556287">All four Federal judges who have considered this case have concluded that a writ of habeas corpus must issue in Mr. Williams' favor for two independent reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.061" offset="6593276">First, because the prosecution introduced at his trial as evidence of guilt statements Mr. Williams made in response to custodial police interrogation prior to receiving any Miranda warnings, and second, independently, because the prosecution also introduced at trial statements Mr. Williams made in response to custodial interrogation by... which were elicited by means which rendered them involuntary under the totality of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.212" offset="6701946">Unless this Court overturns both of those rulings, a writ of habeas corpus must issue and Mr. Williams must be given a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.984" offset="6737054">The Miranda issue in this case is simply whether the rule announced by this Court in Stone v. Powell should be extended to claims that a petitioner's rights under Miranda v. Arizona were violated.</text>

            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="1692.161" offset="6909776">--Certainly, Your Honor, if this Court were to conclude that Federal courts had no jurisdiction to hear Miranda claims, it could and must reach such a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.453" offset="6950945">My first point is that there was no challenge, though... there is no challenge in this Court to any aspects of the merits of the Miranda rulings below, and in our view the rule announced in Stone v. Powell should not and cannot be applied to violations of Miranda's constitutional rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.497" offset="7019072">The rights protected by the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination are so unlike those under the Fourth Amendment, and the relationship of Miranda to the privilege is so different than the relationship between Mapp and the Fourth Amendment, that the concerns that inform this Court's decision in Stone and, we submit, no other concerns counsel favoring extension of that rule to Miranda claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.164" offset="7133698">Indeed, those factors counsel against extending the rule in Stone to Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.282" offset="7154178">I'd like to briefly give the reasons why, and then explain in more detail why I say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.703" offset="7175912">First, because in complete contrast to the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule, Miranda is specifically designed to and does both prevent the constitutional violation from occurring and, if a violation does occur, it redresses the constitutional injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.267" offset="7254174">Second, unlike Stone, which reduce the burden on Federal courts and friction with State courts by taking Federal courts completely out of the business of adjudicating the constitutionality of the admission of physical evidence, depriving Federal habeas courts of the power to adjudicate Miranda claims will produce no such result, and third, unlike the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule, Miranda is not unrelated to fairness and reliability at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.286" offset="7370263">Before I elaborate on those three points, I would like to stress two points which I think are very fundamental in this case, one about Stone and one about Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.392" offset="7410700">Stone v. Powell is not a decision about the scope of the habeas corpus statute, it is a decision about the scope of the judge-made exclusionary rule designed to reinforce the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.700" offset="7463885">Stone itself makes this very clear, and this important distinction is apparent and reiterated in all of this Court's subsequent decisions that have declined to extend Stone beyond the strict confines of the Fourth Amendment and with good reason, because Stone is bound up in the unique status of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.613" offset="7551552">With respect to Miranda, the contention that Miranda v. Arizona announced nothing more than nonconstitutional rules is wrong, and it critically obscures the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.539" offset="7607245">We readily agree that one thing that Miranda v. Arizona did was to announce rules that are not required by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.645" offset="7643712">The warnings themselves, for example, are not constitutionally required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.597" offset="7659490">Miranda says this, and that's what cases like California v. Prysock and Duckworth v. Eagan are about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.953" offset="7688852">Similarly, the mere occurrence of unwarned custodial interrogation absent a use of the statements as evidenced at chief... at trial, while decried by Miranda, does not amount to a constitutional violation because the statements haven't been used against the defendant as testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.616" offset="7771503">This is the precise teaching of this Court's decisions in Michigan v. Tucker and Oregon v. Elstad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.937" offset="7804836">These types of Miranda violations are not at issue in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1978.027" offset="8053208">Those kinds of Miranda violations, like the violations at issue in Eagan and Tucker and Elstad are not at issue in any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.050" offset="8089257">What is at issue here is something fundamentally different, because in addition to these nonconstitutional prophylactic rules, Miranda v. Arizona announced both a fundamental constitutional principle under the self-incrimination clause and a prophylactic rule that this Court said was necessary to protect that right, and if I could just go through both of those briefly, I think it would at least point up my understanding of what's at issue in this case when you are asked to apply Stone v. Powell to Miranda claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.825" offset="8236378">Whatever nonconstitutional rules Miranda announced, it also unambiguously holds that a suspect in custodial interrogation has a fundamental self-executing right to remain silent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2362.972" offset="9592969">One might question whether on the facts Mr. Orozco was in fact in custody, although I certainly would argue that he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.959" offset="9616898">He was awakened by a number of police officers at 4:00 in the morning in his... asleep in his home, but that statement of Orozco, as I think the quotes that I've just provided to the Court from Estelle and Edwards, and there are many other cases, does remain good constitutional doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.505" offset="9683144">In fact, in Elstad itself, this Court distinguished its prior decision in United States v. Harrison on the ground that there, quote, the prosecution had actually violated the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights by introducing the confessions at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.180" offset="9749809">In other words, what's at issue in this case, unlike Eagan and Tucker and Elstad, is the violation of a constitutional right, or at the very least, a rule that this Court has repeatedly emphasized is required by the Constitution, and the question is, can this rule be analogized to Stone?</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.046" offset="9837267">We submit that not a single one of the factors that motivated this Court's decision in Stone to restrict the scope of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule, counsels that result in this kind of a Miranda violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.287" offset="9894214">First of all, the foundation for Stone was the recognition by this Court in many, many cases following Mapp, that the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule was not a personal, constitutional right or a personal right of the defendant because it can neither prevent the Fourth Amendment violation from occurring, nor can it redress the Fourth Amendment injury that the defendant has suffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.290" offset="10002256">Rather, as Justice O'Connor explained in her concurring opinion in Duckworth v. Eagan, the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule is a structural device designed to promote sensitivity to constitutional values through its deterrent effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.966" offset="10064950">It's a constitutional rule, but it's constitutionally required where and only to the extent empirically it serves the function of general deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.524" offset="10111134">In instances where there is no empirical basis for the rule, for example, where the police are acting in good faith, as this Court held in Illinois v. Krull and United States v. Leon and Janis, the rule simply does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.117" offset="10173515">It doesn't extend that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.986" offset="10181038">And that's what this Court decided in Stone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.188" offset="10193786">In Stone, this Court concluded that since the deterrent effect, quote, if any, of applying that deterrent rule in collateral proceedings is negligible at best and the societal costs of enforcing it on Federal collateral proceedings substantial, therefore this Court held that this judicially created deterrent remedy simply doesn't include resort to Federal habeas courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.040" offset="10309247">Now, Miranda is totally different from that on every score.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.325" offset="10326383">In the first place, unlike the Fourth Amendment, which has nothing whatsoever to do with trials, the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination clause is first and foremost a trial right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.149" offset="10373717">The very purpose of the clause is to protect against the introduction at trial of compelled statements of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.322" offset="10406423">Indeed, unlike the Fourth Amendment, which is violated by an unreasonable search regardless of whether a trial ever occurs, no violation of the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination clause is ever completed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2654.676" offset="10759807">The warnings themselves, and even the prohibition against unwarned interrogation, is not constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.781" offset="10792199">What is constitutional is the rule that the introduction of an unwarned statement at trial violates the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.971" offset="10832950">Now, the other answer I have to Your Honor and the more substantive answer I have is that what Miranda v. Arizona stands for is the proposition that the self-incrimination clause imposes a standard different than and in addition to the voluntariness standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.599" offset="10903480">Under the self-incrimination clause, it is not simply enough to show that a defendant's statement was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.437" offset="10930857">If that were the case, there would have been no point in ever applying the self-incrimination clause to the States in the first place, because the voluntariness test has always adhered in the Fourteenth Amendment and in the Fifth Amendment itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.012" offset="10985087">Instead, the self... what Miranda holds is that the self-incrimination clause, a) applies in the station house and b) require... allows a suspect in custody the privilege not to make any statements that can be used against him as evidence of guilt at trial unless he knowingly and voluntarily waives that right, and I submit that this Court's decision in Miranda v.

            <text syncTime="2757.160" offset="11169720">In fact, I think if one examines Justice Harlan's dissent in Miranda, one can see very clearly that certainly he understood that the Court was announcing a constitutional principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.968" offset="11220920">If I could just quote the beginning of Justice Harlan's dissent, having decided that the Fifth Amendment privilege does apply in the police station, the Court reveals that the privilege imposes more exacting restrictions than does the Fourth Amendment's voluntariness test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.096" offset="11289466">It then emerges that the Fifth Amendment requires for an admissible confession that it be given by one distinctly aware of his right not to speak, and shielded from the compelling atmosphere of interrogation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2903.682" offset="11755804">The Fifth Amendment itself, without reference to any prophylactic rule, would require, by its own operation of law, that those statements be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.605" offset="11795510">Now, Miranda also applies an exclusionary rule which does sweep somewhat more broadly, because in some indeterminate number of cases there are people whose statements... unwarned statements are introduced, and in fact it was a law professor who teaches constitutional law and was not at all coerced and made a deliberate decision to waive his rights and try and talk his way out of it, but constitutional law is filled with prophylactic rules like that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3432.784" offset="13872245">I would simply cite this Court to 28 U.S.C. 2243, which authorizes the habeas court to dispose of the matter as law and justice require.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.322" offset="13910383">It seems to me that if this court concludes that it is a better use of the Federal judiciary's time not to delve into the technical aspects of the Miranda claim on habeas but simply to delve into the very heart of the Fifth Amendment to try to prevent any sort of fundamental injustice involving involuntariness, that is certainly within this Court's power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.069" offset="13993348">I think brother counsel and I may disagree about whether that would be a wise thing to do, but I think this Court certainly has the authority to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3544.102" offset="14317476">Lastly, brother counsel has made the point, or has made the assertion that the Fourth Amendment does not exist on Federal habeas review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.327" offset="14362406">That is simply incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.594" offset="14367422">What is true is that on habeas review this Court's inquiry into Fourth Amendment concerns is limited to whether there was a full and fair hearing of the matter in the State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.385" offset="14414651">If the Court finds that there was ample opportunity to fully litigate the matter and that the petitioner's other due process rights were not violated, that is the end of the matter, but if it finds that for one reason or another the petitioner was precluded from raising the Fourth Amendment claim in the State court, then it simply goes on and uses the mechanism Congress has established resolving the claim on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.619" offset="14519559">Lastly, I would simply remind the Court there doesn't really seem to be any disagreement between brother counsel and myself that Miranda does sweep more broadly than the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.475" offset="14558952">It seems to me that Justice O'Connor's point was absolutely correct, once the matter passes through the State appellate system and we get to the Federal habeas court, this Court should be concerned not with the technical rules, not with the rules at the periphery of all these amendments, but rather with the core constitutional right that is involved here, and in the Fifth Amendment context, that right would be the question of involuntariness.</text>
