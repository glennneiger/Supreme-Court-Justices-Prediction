            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="7.685" offset="112495">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals by the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.545" offset="139871">Respondent Thomas Creech entered a plea of guilty to first degree murder for the 1981 beating death of a fellow prison inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.461" offset="183548">The State Trial Court sentenced respondent to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.139" offset="198281">Based in part on the statutory aggravating circumstance that by the murder or circumstances surrounding its commission, the defendant exhibited utter disregard for human life.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.683" offset="252407">The Idaho Supreme Court rejected the respondent's argument that the utter disregard circumstance is unconstitutionally vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.967" offset="289605">It reaffirm the limiting construction it previously had announced in the State case of State against Osborn.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.874" offset="321266">That limiting construction provides in part that the phrase "utter disregard" refers to acts of circumstances surrounding the crime which exhibit the highest, the utmost callous disregard for human life, that is the cold-blooded pitiless slayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.947" offset="393468">Respondent filed that federal habeas petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.382" offset="407261">The District Court denied relief but the Court of Appeals agreed with respondent that the utter disregard circumstance as narrowed by the State's Osborn case is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.274" offset="462849">For reasons explained in an opinion dfile with the Clerk today, we reverse the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.804" offset="496913">The Osborn construction adequately channels the sentencers discretion with clear and objective standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.378" offset="527215">The phrase "cold-blooded pitiless slayer" in its everyday meaning describes a person who kills without feeling or sympathy.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.195" offset="562533">It describes the defendant's state of mind which is a fact that can be inferred from the surrounding circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.548" offset="591894">The Osborn construction also genuinely narrows the class of defendants eligible for the death penalty because the class of murders eligible to receive capital punishment in Idaho is large and a sentencer reasonably could find that not all are cold-blooded.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.046" offset="669948">We do not reach respondent's alternative argument that the utter disregard circumstance although constitutional, cannot be constitutionally applied to him, because under another holding of the Court of Appeals which is not before us today, the respondent is entitled to a new sentencing hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.728" offset="744658">Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Stevens has joined.</text>
