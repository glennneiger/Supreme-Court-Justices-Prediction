            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="140877">We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 91-2086, the Granite State Insurance Company v. the Tandy Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.138" offset="181419">Ms. Webb.</text>

            <label>Ms. Ann E. Webb</label>
            <text syncTime="11.179" offset="185494">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.442" offset="198555">There is only one issue in this case which is truly uncontested.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.834" offset="212139">Granite State and Tandy had been engaged in a significant coverage dispute for over 2 years beginning several months before Granite State filed suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.362" offset="246307">In an effort to resolve an escalating problem, Granite State filed a declaratory judgment action in Federal court using a remedy expressly granted by Congress in the Declaratory Judgment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.458" offset="290611">Both jurisdiction and venue were proper in Houston.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.110" offset="301269">Nonetheless, the district court stayed this action in deference to a later-filed State court action filed almost a month later by Tandy in Fort Worth, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.416" offset="338467">The Fifth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.027" offset="344946">By giving the district court virtually unfettered discretion to defer to the State courts, the Fifth Circuit has judicially eviscerated an affirmative legislative remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.105" offset="385279">Granite State is here today asking this Court to reinstate the Declaratory Judgment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.136" offset="405341">There are two questions presented by this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.538" offset="419029">The first is whether a district court with unquestioned jurisdiction can abstain from hearing an action validly before it simply because of the presence of a later-filed State court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.945" offset="460616">The second issue is whether the abstention decision of the district court is reviewed de novo or for abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.581" offset="491127">Because of the importance of the comity and Federalism issued presented by abstention decisions, it is important that courts of appeals stringently address... stringently review the decision of the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.710" offset="547656">The pendency of a parallel action is always a consideration in an abstention decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.774" offset="579943">There is no abstention decision unless there is a parallel State court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.287" offset="593945">This cannot be an exceptional circumstance which will justify abstention from a Federal court's unflagging obligation to exercise its valid jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.694" offset="635636">In determining whether an abstention decision is appropriate, a Federal court must begin with one of the fundamental precepts of our Federal judicial system, and this Court has stated that Federal courts have no more right to decline the exercise of valid jurisdiction than to usurp that which is not given.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.127" offset="713377">The one or the other is treasonous to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.029" offset="724975">Abstention is an extraordinary and narrow exception to a Federal court's unflagging obligation to exercise its valid jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="154.144" offset="757367">Well, Ms. Webb, are you assuming that an action for a declaratory judgment in that respect is the same as an action for an injunction or for damages because the declaratory judgment statute which you set forth in your brief at page 3 says that the district court may declare the rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.287" offset="837928">It certainly suggests discretion to do so or not to do so, doesn't it?</text>

            <label>Ms. Ann E. Webb</label>
            <text syncTime="179.191" offset="857573">Your Honor, there seems to be some discretion in the declaratory judgment statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.605" offset="879202">We believe the discretion is not whether or not a district court may hear the case, but whether or not the district court may grant the release asked for.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.861" offset="916296">There are many occasions in which declaratory relief is sought, but declaratory relief isn't appropriate for one reason or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.595" offset="943254">For example, in the Grow case, it's... the Voting Rights Act precludes the granting of declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.487" offset="966764">The State legislative prerogative precludes the granting of declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.533" offset="986931">A case cited by my co-counsel, Mansour v. Green, the Eleventh Amendment barred the granting of declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.267" offset="1013889">We believe that is where the discretion lies.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.849" offset="1024234">The courts do not have discretion whether or not to decline jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.700" offset="1039594">Jurisdiction is mandatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.222" offset="1053700">We believe that the Brillhart case, a decision almost 50 years old at this point, cannot be read in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.196" offset="1077628">It must be read in light of this Court's intervening decisions, in Colorado River, Moses Cone, and most recently in the NOPSI decision, in which this Court has applied a different type of analysis to cases involving the Declaratory Judgment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.295" offset="1129977">They have not relegated declaratory judgment cases to the unfettered discretion of the district judge as Brillhart seemed to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="262.076" offset="1189119">Moses Cone was begun as a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that the Arbitration Act applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.848" offset="1216181">NOPSI, the New Orleans public service case issued by this Court in 1989, was expressly seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.807" offset="1268008">After hearing all the evidence the district court says, well, in light of the fact that there is a State court action pending, I don't think it's a good idea to issue the declaratory judgment you want and therefore, exercising the discretion I have not to issue the declaratory judgment, though I don't have any discretion whether to take all the evidence, I won't give you the declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.022" offset="1368946">Is that how it works?</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.169" offset="6593540">At the heart of this case is an understanding of the purpose of declaratory relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.953" offset="6624678">The purpose of a declaratory judgment is to settle and to clarify legal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.626" offset="6647352">It is to provide relief from uncertainty and from insecurity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.170" offset="6665533">But here, what Granite State is trying to do is to turn these wholesome purposes of declaratory judgment relief on its head, and instead of simplifying the issues, declaratory relief in this case would complicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.492" offset="6726764">Instead of clarify, it would confuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.553" offset="6738990">To have a declaratory judgment action take place in this case would increase costs, and it would waste judicial resources and personal resources and the resources of the parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="2067.348" offset="8410199">The principles underlying the unflagging obligation of the court to consider a case are different, because this is a declaratory judgment action and a declaratory judgment action is discretionary, and there's a specific legislative mandate that makes that discretionary, and that's why it's different, that the whole difference in this case is the fact it's a declaratory judgment action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.405" offset="8518451">If it were not, we wouldn't disagree that the court has an unflagging duty to exercise jurisdiction, but the fact of the matter is, this is a declaratory judgment action, and Congress has said that that is discretionary, as has this Court in Brillhart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.767" offset="8587937">And so if I may come back to your question, Justice White, only to say that yes, the factors apply in the sense of making a common sense determination, but as far as using the standard, the unflagging obligation standard in applying those factors, that does not apply to this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2204.077" offset="8957099">There are some cases that have come through the circuits where the court has actually reversed the case based on an abuse of discretion for hearing the case after the district court granted the declaratory judgment relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.330" offset="9022196">As a matter of fact, most of those cases you'll find in the petitioner's brief, because they use that in support of their contention that de novo is a proper standard of review, and perhaps I could address that for just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.029" offset="9072978">It seems logical, and perhaps going back to what Justice White was talking about, about the Fifth Circuit's view of this, and just a great deal of discretion, but it seems logical that if there is discretion to grant declaratory relief, or to hear a declaratory judgment case, then that should be reviewed on an abuse of discretion standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.845" offset="9168168">But just in looking at the cases as they reach the circuits and they apply a de novo review, they apply that review to cases where the court did indeed hear a declaratory judgment action and then the circuits reverse on a de novo review of the granting of the declaratory relief, and I think that's significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.650" offset="9263463">I think it supports our position, because our position is that this is a case in which... and this type of case is a case in which the court should not have granted and should at least properly exercise its discretion and refuse to hear the declaratory judgment relief request.</text>

            <text syncTime="3006.003" offset="12164831">This is peculiarly an issue of State court interest, because that's what is being construed, is a provision in the contract, and the resulting bad faith claims that we have, breach of contract, all of those are peculiar to the State and State court law, and that is another factor, I believe, that the court decides in exercising its discretion to grant the declaratory judgment action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.741" offset="12271829">There are many factors the court can apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="3048.312" offset="12334105">It would be possible, and certainly Judge Hittner did that to a degree in analyzing the Moses Cone and Colorado River factors, to look at other things, like the order in which jurisdiction was acquired and some of the other factors that are found in other cases, but the point is that if, in the exercise of its discretion, the court doesn't fulfill the purposes of the Declaratory Judgment Act, that relief, to provide relief to simplify and to clarify issues, then that declaratory judgment is not appropriate, and for these reasons... yes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3229.412" offset="13058428">We believe the appropriate construction is to give a consistent application regardless of where the loss occurs, be it Korea, Australia, Singapore, Texas, Seattle, any one of the States that has a water port.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.509" offset="13106911">The only consistent application is to apply the law that is equivalent to the law of England, which is Federal maritime law, and we don't believe that the McCarran-Ferguson Act, and</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.607" offset="13147244">"the insurance regulation belongs to the State. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.679" offset="13151528">applies here, because the doctrine of utmost good faith is a well-entrenched maritime good doctrine, and it is not one of those cases where State insurance law should fill the cracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.947" offset="13192593">I'd like to comment briefly about the district court never... about some of the points raised by Ms. Liberato.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.332" offset="13226134">We're talking about the making of a policy of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.543" offset="13238986">The place of the loss has nothing to do with the making of the policy, and the policy itself says the choice of law is English, and we believe that gets you to maritime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.448" offset="13278588">The place of the loss in Korea has nothing to do with the choice of law that should apply to the formation of the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.225" offset="13309726">With regard to the several questions about the standard of review, abstention doctrine is a question of law, which is customarily reviewed de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.022" offset="13344939">It is further important that this type of decision be reviewed de novo because of the comity and federalism concerns that are raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.015" offset="13372838">We believe that both the decision whether or not to keep a case within the Federal jurisdiction as well as the decision on the merits should both be reviewed under a legal standard de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.362" offset="13414320">The district court partially reviewed the Colorado River factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.424" offset="13434487">He did not review the choice of law issue, and he failed to weigh any of the issues in favor of the unflagging obligation to exercise jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.060" offset="13461027">We further believe that he did not correctly evaluate some of the ones he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.842" offset="13476178">For instance, the minimal inconvenience between Houston, Texas and Forth Worth, Texas, when there were something upwards of 50 flights a day between the two cities, between the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston, cannot be justified in this modern era.</text>
