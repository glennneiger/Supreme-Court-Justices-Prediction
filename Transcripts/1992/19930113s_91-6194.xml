            <text syncTime="9.447" offset="119496">This case comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.507" offset="139767">The petitioner Crosby failed to appear at the beginning of his federal criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.381" offset="167248">He had been present at various preliminary proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.042" offset="185847">The District Court permitted the trial to go on in his absence and he was convicted and subsequently arrested and sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.921" offset="221373">He argued that the trial was prohibited by Rule 43 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and this provides that a defendant must be present at every trial stage "except as otherwise provided" by the Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.296" offset="290859">The Rule, however, lists situations in which a right to be present maybe waived including when a defendant "initially present" is voluntarily absent thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.242" offset="354702">The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.940" offset="365465">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.588" offset="380093">We conclude that the Rule clearly indicates that the situations in which the trial may proceed without the defendant is exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.197" offset="418546">The decision is unanimous.</text>
