            <text syncTime="47.397" offset="318818">The spectators are admonished to remain silent until you get out of the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.683" offset="335955">The Court remains in session.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.837" offset="356539">Mr. Klonoff, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Klonoff</label>
            <text syncTime="73.279" offset="422368">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="76.464" offset="435116">Section 525 of The Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act excludes a service member's period of military service from any period provided by law for the redemption of real property forfeited for nonpayment of real estate taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.510" offset="495302">The issue here is whether a service member must show hardship in order to invoke section 525.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.080" offset="521529">We submit that the courts below, in imposing such a requirement, violated this Court's case law and statutory interpretation for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.019" offset="557264">First, section 525 by its plain language imposes no hardship requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.673" offset="583909">Second, several other sections of the statute do impose a hardship requirement, while other sections, like section 525, do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.529" offset="623302">This confirms that Congress acted deliberately when it did not impose a hardship requirement under section 525.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.050" offset="653395">Third, this Court has made clear that statutes providing benefits to service members should be liberally construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.955" offset="685055">For these reasons, we submit that this Court should enforce the statute as written and decline respondent's invitation to rewrite the statute on policy grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.095" offset="725597">The facts in this case are simple, and I will spend just a moment on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.564" offset="743465">At the time of trial, Colonel Conroy had been on continuous active duty in the U.S. Army since 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.384" offset="770737">He purchased the property at issue in May 1973, and paid all real estate taxes between 1973 and 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.307" offset="806472">He did not pay his taxes in '84 through '86, having received no tax notices from the town.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.246" offset="834162">The Town of Danforth seized his land under Maine law and sold it in two parcels to respondents Aniskoff and H. C. Haynes in December 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.518" offset="875331">Upon learning of the sale, Colonel Conroy acted promptly in asserting his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.439" offset="898946">When Aniskoff and Haynes refused to give up the land, Colonel Conroy brought quiet title actions based on section 525.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.695" offset="931965">The trial court held that despite section 525's clear language, a service member had to show hardship from military service, which Colonel Conroy did not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.419" offset="978881">The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine affirmed the Superior Court by an equally divided vote and did not express any reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.359" offset="1018691">We submit that this case should be controlled by this Court's decision last term in King v. St. Vincent's Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.416" offset="1054845">At issue in King was a National Guard member who sought a 3-year leave of absence from his hospital employer to join the Active Guard Reserve program as a command sergeant major.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.688" offset="1099984">He claimed that under the plain language of the Veteran Reemployment Rights Act he was allowed to return to his job with the same seniority, pay, and vacation as if he had not left.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.413" offset="1138854">The hospital denied the leave request on the ground that the period requested was unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.067" offset="1161529">Although the statutory language contained no limits for leave requests, the lower courts... both the Eleventh Circuit and the district court... imposed a reasonableness requirement because of their concern about the burdens placed on employers of allowing employees to return after long leaves of absences.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.945" offset="1241045">This Court unanimously reversed... Justice Thomas did not participate... because, really for the same reasons that I am urging here: 1) the language of the section at issue was clear, 2) other parts of the statute, by contrast, explicitly imposed time limits, and 3) the statute provided benefits to members of the armed services.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.227" offset="1330175">The Court acknowledged that the statute was harsh, but refused to rewrite the law and noted that that was Congress' job.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.880" offset="1356716">Here, we have an identical situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.249" offset="1370195">The language of section 525 is absolutely clear, and there has been no claim as far as I know on any case that there is an ambiguity in section 525.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.724" offset="1416170">Under this Court's case law, we submit that the clear language of the statute should be the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.211" offset="1446054">However, it is even clearer than just the language of section 525 alone, since a review of the statute indicates that several other sections, unlike section 525, impose a hardship requirement explicitly, and we cited numerous examples on page 12, footnotes 11 and 12, of our opening brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.076" offset="1541558">We have also cited a number of examples of other parts of the statute that, like section 525, contain no prejudice requirement, so it seems to me quite clear that the statute was very carefully drafted and that when Congress wanted to impose a hardship requirement, it did so explicitly, and we point for example, section 560, which is of particular interest, since right within the same section you've got juxtaposition of a hardship and no-hardship standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="386.047" offset="1673424">Mr. Klonoff, the statute really doesn't say that any property sold in violation of the Federal prohibition is not effectively sold, does it?</text>
            <text syncTime="396.022" offset="1713339">Is that a matter of State law?</text>
            <text syncTime="398.055" offset="1721490">I mean, could Maine law say that if this statute is violated and we goof and make the sale within the 18-month period, a good faith purchaser nonetheless has title, and maybe you have a cause of action against Maine but not against the BFP?</text>

            <text syncTime="447.305" offset="1918453">But the whole concept of a redemption is the right to actually... if title is passed, the right to take back title.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.308" offset="1942485">In Maine, the way the law is constructed is title doesn't even pass until the end of the redemption period.</text>

            <text syncTime="459.112" offset="1965682">You're saying that Maine does not have the authority to give title until that period is passed, and because it is tolled Maine therefore can never give even... cannot even give a good title subject to defeasance later.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="473.503" stopTime="491.667">

            <text syncTime="473.503" offset="2023256">Not inconsistent with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.205" offset="2030048">We read the statute as allowing the serviceman, if title is transferred and there's a period of redemption, to take the title back.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.542" offset="2059410">I suppose what could be done, since it talks about any period of redemption provided by law, is, I suppose, to not have any redemption period in this situation.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="491.667" offset="2095876">No, but I just wanted to make sure that I understood what you were saying to Justice Scalia, and I thought the theory that you were espousing was that because the period of service is not included... cannot be included in computing the redemption period, that the redemption period never runs.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.609" offset="2163690">Because it never runs, Maine, or the town, whatever it is, never acquires the authority to give any title at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.198" offset="2190022">Isn't that your theory?</text>

            <text syncTime="515.815" offset="2192530">Well, that's right, but in some States the title actually will pass, subject to the redemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.186" offset="2213950">If there's a redemption statute, the way it works is that the title would be returned.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="525.805" offset="2232445">But that's not the way it works, on your view, in Maine, is it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="528.590" stopTime="750.751">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Klonoff</label>
            <text syncTime="528.590" offset="2243625">No, that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.073" offset="2245506">In Maine it doesn't work that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.792" offset="2260343">So as we indicated, these sections and the juxtaposition in 560 makes clear that Congress knew how to pose a hardship requirement when it wanted to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.182" offset="2301930">And finally, as I indicated, this Court has made clear in a number of cases that statutes of this sort must be liberally construed in favor of the serviceman.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.240" offset="2350205">The court below... the trial court... did not make a textual argument, but instead expressed concerns about the possible impact of purchasers of property if service members are allowed to come in years later to redeem their property, but as in King, we submit that any such concerns are for Congress and not for the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.320" offset="2434528">We think that in this case the lower court misunderstood its role, believing that if a statute was harsh, a court could ignore the plain language, but under this Court's case law a court is almost never permitted to ignore the plain language on policy grounds, and certainly not for the reasons offered below.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.549" offset="2503387">This Court has made clear that the statute literally read must be patently absurd, with consequences so bizarre that Congress could not have intended them, and it's been phrased in a number of different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.875" offset="2560752">In the Crooks case from 1930, which has been cited in Griffin and TVA v. Hill, it was made clear that it's not enough that it's merely absurd, and that oftentimes laws have effects that weren't contemplated, but it's for Congress to decide the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.901" offset="2620833">And this Court in a number of cases... Griffin, has said that harsh consequences are not enough, a situation where a seaman was entitled to receive over 300,000 dollars from an employer because of a 412 dollar withholding of wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.811" offset="2676422">The TVA v. Hill, which involved a multimillion dollar dam project which was stopped near completion, the Court said that the result was curious, but not enough to override... and numerous other cases that this Court... and this Court has made clear in Estate of Cowart that even if a statute could be characterized as stark or troubling, it is the duty of the court to enforce Congress' language even if the court questions its wisdom.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.997" offset="2797212">Now, looking at section 525 and actually juxtaposing 525 with the situation in King, we would submit that there's not even an absurdity, let alone a situation that's so patently absurd that Congress could not have intended it.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.757" offset="2860219">In King, for example, it's interesting to note that the 3-year period was not the end of the possibility in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.946" offset="2893029">There was a question asked at page 6 of the oral argument in that case, in the transcript, about whether or not the period could be renewed four times for, say, 12 years, and the answer that the Assistant to the Solicitor General gave was that theoretically that's possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.538" offset="2955410">She didn't know of a case, but theoretically it was possible, and the situation, then, you have in King, was somebody coming back 12 years and basically... and in King, for example, the individuals reflected in the Eleventh Circuit opinion was the manager of security could come in 12 years later and just walk in and demand his job back after somebody had been hired and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.373" offset="3058750">And so really, that is or could be a harsh and troubling situation, but it was not enough, and in fact the Court... although the Eleventh Circuit resolved the case as a matter of absurd consequences, this Court in King didn't even address the absurd consequences at all, and just said that the matter was for Congress to consider.</text>

            <text syncTime="1122.677" offset="4619932">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.629" offset="4631739">I would like to begin by addressing Justice Scalia's question about the bona fide purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.966" offset="4661101">The statute contains one provision which explicitly addresses when a bona fide purchaser of land can obtain relief when a transaction is affected by the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.077" offset="4733512">That is provided in section 520 of the Appendix, which deals with default judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.064" offset="4757441">If a default judgment is entered against a service member, and the service member can show within a specified period subsequent to his military service that he was prejudiced in his ability to defend the suit because of his military service, he can have that judgment vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.478" offset="4839152">The provision explicitly provides that any property obtained by a bona fide purchaser for value pursuant to that judgment will be protected against the vacation of that default judgment by the service member.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.404" offset="4894845">Now, this illustrates one important point... two important points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.856" offset="4912608">First, under section 525, there is no similar protection, so the right to redeem is tolled irrespective of any State law that would protect a bona fide purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.597" offset="4955658">Second, it shows that the statute is a very carefully drafted provision for the protection of service members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.305" offset="4998394">Mr. Justice Brandeis stated, writing for the Court in--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="1219.841" offset="5008634">The Federal Government might have wanted to protect by Federal law a BFP in the one situation, and decided not to protect him by Federal law in the other, but left it open to the State to protect him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.148" offset="5065790">Isn't that a conceivable explanation?</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. Manning</label>
            <text syncTime="1238.218" offset="5082090">--It is conceivable, Justice Scalia, that that is the case, but it seems to me more likely, given the comprehensiveness of the statutory scheme and the extent to which Congress was careful in specifying which remedies would and would not be available and the desire of Congress to protect the service member from various State law judgments and liabilities during the period of service, that it's much more likely that the force of section 525, which is broad and absolute in its terms, must be taken as preemptive of any State law right to vest the title in a bona fide purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.725" offset="5232138">Otherwise, a State could simply, by a variety of State rules, eliminate a protection that is broad, that is mandatory, and that is unqualified in its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.533" offset="5279367">Along the lines of the implications of the statute, I'd like to point out that as Justice Brandeis said in Ebert v. Poston, this statute was so carefully drafted that very little is left to conjecture, and given the act's disparate inclusion and omission of a prejudice requirement in its various sections, the failure to include a prejudice requirement in section 525 must be understood as a deliberate policy choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.802" offset="5400471">Congress carefully considered when prejudice should, and more importantly should not, be a factor in awarding relief under the act, and it obviously decided that in section 525 it should not be awarded... it should not be a factor in the relief granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.347" offset="5470583">Now, to highlight a point that Mr. Klonoff made, I'd like to direct the Court's attention to section 560 of the Appendix.</text>

            <text syncTime="1371.770" offset="5616347">Now, the property at issue here is not among the classes of property that's covered by that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.923" offset="5640902">It relates to... in terms of real property, it relates to residential, business, professional, and agricultural property owned by the service member at the commencement of service and still owned at the time of the tax sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="1400.206" offset="5730032">If... before a tax sale can occur, a court order must be obtained for that type of property, and the service member or his dependents may get a stay of the tax sale during the period of military service unless the service member's ability to pay or his dependents' ability to pay the taxes is not materially affected by the military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.904" offset="5828879">So there is an explicit prejudice requirement contained in that provision which supplies relief from the tax sale itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.193" offset="5862002">In the very next provision of section 560, the act provides that the period of redemption, the right of redemption or the right to bring an action for redemption, shall extend throughout the period of the act and for 6 months thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.103" offset="5917591">It has no mention of material effect of military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.555" offset="5935458">It has no prejudice requirement in the text of the statute, and that provision, which dates back in its original form to the 1918 legislation, shows that Congress intentionally distinguished between the kinds of relief it would be providing for tax forfeitures, and when it got to the point of redemption, it decided to provide an absolute protection that extended without regard to prejudice throughout the period of military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.408" offset="6046845">Now, respondents don't claim that the similarly worded language of section 525 is ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.728" offset="6076102">What they claim is that the Court should not apply the statute as written because of the practical consequences of allowing a career service member to redeem his property throughout the period of military service without a showing of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.606" offset="6143602">Now, apart from the fact that the practical consequences argument is foreclosed by this Court's decision in King v. St. Vincent's Hospital, the statute as written is far from absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.414" offset="6194907">Respondents don't claim that it's absurd to redeem the tolling provision... to toll the redemption provision for service members in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.370" offset="6234717">What they claim is that it is absurd to do so without a particularized inquiry in each case into whether there has been prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.959" offset="6269094">Now, that is simply not absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.947" offset="6284977">Congress, because the period of redemption is the last safety valve before property is lost irrevocably, it is perfectly rational for Congress to have decided that it would provide service members with the assurance that their property would not be lost forever during their period of military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.610" offset="6367628">Because of its self-executing nature, section 525 provides service members with the peace of mind that they will not have to rely on a court's determination in hindsight that this or that tour of duty was or was not prejudicial to their ability to redeem their property, and so what it does is, in effect, it gives the service members an effective right to wait their period of military service before exercising their right of redemption, otherwise we doubt that many service members would take the risk that a court would, in hindsight, find that they had not been prejudiced by their tour of military duty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1633.623" offset="6663752">If a service member were entitled to toll his redemption period upon a showing of prejudice, it would be equally difficult, indeed, impossible to tell from the chain of title whether there was a service member in the chain of title, and whether the service member's particular tour of duty was prejudicial to his ability to redeem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1700.267" offset="6930306">As has been stated, the former owner, Mr. Conroy, was in the military service at all pertinent times here, and he had residences in South Portland, Maine, and also in Wisconsin.</text>

I think counsel collectively has done the Court a disservice, apparently, because we have not included for you section 560, as far as I am concerned, in any readily available form so that you can look at it right now, because I agree with these gentlemen, section 560 is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.389" offset="7174812">Not having any expertise in this when this case was brought to me, I looked at 560, because it's the particular section that seems to apply here, and I read it through, and I checked to see, did this fit within the area of someone who owned real property that was occupied for dwelling purposes or professional purposes or business or agriculture?</text>

            <text syncTime="2632.997" offset="10661218">They talk about career servicemen and noncareer servicemen, and I think that that's another way of saying prejudice, or hardship.</text>
