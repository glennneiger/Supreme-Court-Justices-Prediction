            <text syncTime="7.431" offset="111475">These are No. 91-1420, is Growe versus Emison.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.600" offset="144180">It is an appeal from the three-judge District Court in the District of Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.995" offset="165705">The petitioner John Growe is the Secretary of State of Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.458" offset="203531">The case is difficult to describe because at issue are really two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.647" offset="228295">A group of Minnesota voters filed an action in State Court against the Minnesota's Secretary of State and other election officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.184" offset="266433">Alleging that in light of the 1990 Census, Minnesota's Federal congressional and state legislative districts were malapportioned in violation of the Federal and State Constitutions, and seeking, in that suit, declaratory relief and judicial creation of new districts, if the state legislature failed to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.852" offset="361206">Shortly and after that suit was filed and that suit is not is the suit before us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.264" offset="386806">The appealees in the present case in another group of Minnesota voters filed an action against essentially the same defendants including the Secretary of State seeking the same relief in Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.319" offset="439051">The Federal suit raised the same constitutional claims and in addition raised a claim that the legislative district in Minneapolis diluted minority voting rights in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.060" offset="506029">While these two cases were pending, the Minnesota state legislature adopted a plan for new legislative districts, new state districts, but that plan contained numerous drafting errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.902" offset="565379">The District Court, the Federal Court set a deadline for the state legislature to redistrict both legislative and congressional districts and refused to abstain or to defer to the State Court action which was pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.961" offset="625565">The State Court meanwhile, issued a preliminary legislative plan correcting the technical errors in the State's legislative plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.659" offset="668406">It intended to hold that plan and advance pending action by the legislature to correct its own mistakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.860" offset="697140">The District Court, the Federal Court, then stayed further proceedings in the State Court action forbad the State Court from proceeding any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.855" offset="733189">This Court, one month later, vacated that federal stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.510" offset="755759">When legislature failed to act, the State Court issued a final order adapting its own legislative plan and held hearings on competing proposals for a congressional districting plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.830" offset="809049">The District Court, the Federal Court intern adapted its own legislative and congressional redistricting plan and permanently enjoined interference with implementation of its plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.921" offset="853457">The court concluded in effect that the State Court's legislative plan violated section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because it did not contain a super majority minority Senate district in Minneapolis, that is a district in which minority voters were a clear majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.388" offset="923256">The District Court's plan did contain such a district with a majority composed of at least three distinct minority groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.481" offset="959723">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.521" offset="975815">In accord with our opinion in a case called Scott versus Germano, we conclude that the District Court erred in not deferring to the State Court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.640" offset="1012282">States have the primary duty and responsibility to draw there election districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.584" offset="1036105">Federal Courts must defer action when a state through its Legislative or Judicial Branch has begun in timely fashion to perform that task.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.911" offset="1081349">Moreover, in finding a violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act the District Court erred in not applying the pre-requisites identified in a case called Thornburg versus Gingles, for vote dilution challenges to multimember districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.889" offset="1149268">We hold today that the three Gingles pre conditions namely a minority group that is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in the single-member district; minority political cohesion; and thirdly majority block voting that enables defeated minority preferred candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.966" offset="1233591">Those two factors also apply to a vote delusion challenge to a Single-member district.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.699" offset="1256579">In the present case there is no evidence of majority block voting or of political cohesion among the three minority groups the District Court combined in the new district.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.391" offset="1303286">The Gingles preconditions were normally ignored, but on the present records were unattainable.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.350" offset="1331184">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case is remanded with instructions to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.864" offset="1353232">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
