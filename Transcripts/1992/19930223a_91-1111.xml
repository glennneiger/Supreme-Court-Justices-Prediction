            <text syncTime="30.602" offset="288252">Mr. Shapiro, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="33.304" offset="299014">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="36.256" offset="310821">I appear on behalf of the domestic insurance defendants who are petitioners in Case Number 91-1111.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.910" offset="341437">We're hear today to contend that the Ninth Circuit's forfeiture ruling in this case was wrong, and in addition that the Ninth Circuit was wrong in overturning Judge Schwarzer's decision on the McCarran boycott issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.885" offset="389398">As the Court is aware, the Ninth Circuit held in this case that the domestic defendants forfeited their McCarran Act immunity by acting in concert with foreign reinsurers, and it held in addition that their conduct amounted to a boycott within the meaning of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.596" offset="452196">On the forfeiture issue, we agree with the Justice Department that the domestic defendants, which both courts below found were engaged in the regulated business of insurance, did not forfeit their immunity simply by acting in concert with foreign reinsurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.272" offset="514890">The Government properly points out that the McCarran immunity literally focuses on the regulated business of insurance and does not focus narrowly on the regulated status of each participant in that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.914" offset="565463">Congress understood when it passed the McCarran act that domestic insurers would enter into agreements with reinsurers, including foreign reinsurers, and it believed that antitrust immunity would extend to these insurance practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.689" offset="620634">Under this statute, the exemption of domestic insurers does not simply vanish when they deal with entities such as consumer groups or risk managers or foreign reinsurers, all of which are vital participants in the forms-developmentprocess and each of which can easily be characterized as a nonexempt entity or a so-called coconspirator.</text>

            <text syncTime="134.003" offset="701822">What, then, do you do with the language in Royal Drug Company, Mr. Shapiro, about when you conspire or agree with someone who's not protected the exempt party loses the exemption?</text>

            <text syncTime="160.736" offset="808820">Now, in this case everybody is within the insurance industry and the Justice Department properly points out that Royal Drug is not support for the forfeiture ruling here.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.282" offset="883007">And that is certainly not conceded that the foreign insurers, or the reinsurers generally, are within the business of insurance regulated by the State.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="186.185" offset="910593">--Both courts below found that all domestic defendants, including the reinsurers, were regulated under State law, and the Justice Department agrees that these regulated entities that are acting within the business of insurance don't lose their immunity simply because they enter into discussions or agreements with foreign reinsurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.747" offset="984781">The issue of whether they're regulated is not before the Court in our petition or in any cross-petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.753" offset="1008813">Both courts below correctly decided that my clients, the domestic companies, were regulated.</text>

            <text syncTime="220.375" offset="1047370">I mean, you can't play the game both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.561" offset="1060118">You're either talking about the business of insurance or you're talking about individuals, and we're talking about the business of insurance.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.197" offset="1086658">So... so the question is whether the business of reinsurance is, number 1, part of the business of insurance, which I assume it is, and number 2, regulated by the States.</text>

            <text syncTime="242.105" offset="1134305">My clients are accused of participating in the forms-developmentprocess.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.176" offset="1150501">The reinsurers participated in the forms-developmentprocess along with the primary insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.461" offset="1167638">The States had plenary jurisdiction over everybody who participated in the forms-developmentprocess, and if there were some interaction between a domestic company and a foreign company, that could be regulated with the unfair insurance practices laws which all 50 States have enacted and which this Court squarely held is enough to predicate McCarran immunity.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="269.005" stopTime="300.727">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="269.005" offset="1241825">The forms-developmentprocess cannot compel a reinsurer to reinsure something that he doesn't want to reinsure or that he's agreed with others not to reinsure, can it?</text>
            <text syncTime="280.980" offset="1289786">The form process has nothing to do with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.849" offset="1297205">In fact, as I understand it, all the States except one permit the first kind of insurance that's been eliminated... event occurrence insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.007" offset="1353838">All States but one permit it, but it's not offered by anybody, right?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="300.727" offset="1368781">Well, as a matter of fact, 98 percent of the commercial general liability policies today are written on occurrence forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.416" offset="1403471">It's wrong to say that they've been eliminated, although the complaint alleges that they have been reduced in quantity.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.201" offset="1422697">Now, if a State insurance regulator believed that there was some improper concerted action that was constricting the flow of this coverage into the marketplace, they have ample means under State unfair insurance practice laws to deal with any agreement that they believe is contrary to public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.680" offset="1492601">These laws are passed in all 50 States for the very purpose of taking the place of Federal antitrust statutes in order to invoke the McCarran immunity for the industry, and they reach reinsurers just as much as they reach primary insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.439" offset="1547563">The district court so concluded after extensive briefing, and the court of appeals didn't disagree with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="355.695" offset="1588627">Oh, no, sir, they are specifically focused on the insurance industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.413" offset="1603465">These are model laws based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' proposed statute right after this Court's decision in the South-Eastern case.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.788" offset="1640976">They focus precisely on insurance, and they deal with anticompetitive acts in the insurance industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.157" offset="1662501">This Court held squarely in the National Casualty case in the fifties that if the States pass these laws, and if these laws embrace the anticompetitive actions, that, standing by itself, is sufficient for McCarran immunity purposes, and that precedent has been followed ever since and the industry and regulators have relied on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="915.513" offset="3827843">Congress recognized that standardization of forms is critical to the regulated business of insurance, and it recognized that there must be agreement among insurers and reinsurers if these forms are going to be reinsured at the end of the day, and plaintiffs now seem to acknowledge that this process of forms standardization, even with blunt opposition to unacceptable terms in the policies, does not constitute a boycott, and in our view it makes absolutely no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.748" offset="3932856">The primary insurers, "enlisted" or "encouraged" reinsurers to announce that they would only reinsure if certain changes were made in these proposed forms, and that's because insurers and reinsurers have inseparable interests in the underlying risks, and one of the very key purposes of forms standardization is to make sure that these forms will be reinsurable after the forms have been developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.363" offset="4031285">The McCarran act rests on Congress' judgment that this industry is unique, and agreements in this industry promote insurer solvency and consumer welfare even though they have anticompetitive effects.</text>

            <text syncTime="1525.792" offset="6269038">It treats everybody the same way, nobody is singled out and ganged up against, reinsurance is available, it's just a change in general coverage terms, and I hope I can convince the Court that Congress meant generically agreements relating to terms and coverage to be grist for the administrative mill and not for the antitrust court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.403" offset="6339465">And the reason for that was that Congress believed that these agreements have the potential to rationalize underwriting, and this is a perfect example, because there was a tort liability crisis, insolvencies were skyrocketing in the insurance industry in 1984, it was the worst year in history for the commercial general liability insurers, and when they respond to the tort liability crisis with these general coverage terms that don't single anyone out and punish anyone or discipline anyone, that isn't a boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.721" offset="6448761">What Congress was worried about when it prohibited a boycott was the kind of thing that you saw in South-East Underwriters, where there were trial-type proceedings and people were expelled from the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.028" offset="6489930">They couldn't get reinsurance at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.828" offset="6497140">They were singled out and they were penalized in that fashion, and that's light years removed from a general, nondiscriminatory agreement changing terms and coverage, which is exactly what Congress meant to immunize, and I think this Court's opinion in Barry recognizes that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1805.131" offset="7386348">We submit that the answer to that question must be yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.417" offset="7403484">The claims at issue... it is important to give a little bit of context to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.421" offset="7423546">Treaty reinsurance is written to cover large bundles of risks presented by primary insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.658" offset="7448519">The subscription nature of the Lloyd's marketplace gives it the capacity to absorb risks of a magnitude that probably cannot be absorbed elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.264" offset="7482896">There is no allegation in this claims that plaintiffs sought to purchase treaty reinsurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.116" offset="7502332">There is also no allegation in these claims that these agreements were entered at the behest of any American actor, or that these London reinsurer defendants sought to serve anyone's interest but their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.458" offset="7551651">This Court has never upheld the exercise of antitrust jurisdiction in comparable circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.446" offset="7575579">The process that is employed to assess the limits of jurisdictional reach... the weighing of competing sovereign interests, the search for links of nationality and territory, and the discerning consideration of the expectations of the parties in the international system, is not new to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.241" offset="7646841">It is reflected in decisions ranging from Lauritzen v. Larsen to Mitsubishi v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth to, most recently, the Asahi case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.513" offset="7687905">All of these cases were decided by this Court in favor of the result that would lend the greatest stability to international commerce, even where that meant foregoing the United States' interest in the application of its own laws or the availability of the United States courts as a forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.106" offset="7750286">If the Court applies the rationale of those cases here, it will be compelled to dismiss these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.109" offset="7778289">This case was decided by the courts below on the authority of Timberlane Lumber Company v. Bank of America, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit decision that created a jurisdictional rule of reason for determining when the full reach of jurisdiction should be moderated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.638" offset="7844431">Under Timberlane and under the Restatement, Third, of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States, the existence of effects in the forum State is only the beginning of the analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.260" offset="7890929">Both authorities ask, even if a basis for jurisdiction exists, is the interest of another State so overwhelming that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable?</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.884" offset="7937427">Here, that inquiry leads to the inevitable conclusion that the potential reach of the Sherman Act must be tempered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.240" offset="7966789">The primary consideration in the inquiry is the avoidance of conflict with the law and policy of another State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.013" offset="7997927">The conflict in this case is graphic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.679" offset="8008585">Here, the application of American competition policy would conflict with the United Kingdom's interest, which it has quite vehemently stated, in protecting its regulatory scheme from the intrusion of incompatible standards under the U.S. antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.523" offset="8067935">Those standards are incompatible for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.225" offset="8078697">First, the United Kingdom's entire regulatory framework is designed to accommodate collective underwriting and to encourage prudent risk-taking within that framework.</text>

            <text syncTime="2050.023" offset="8365940">The United Kingdom says there is a conflict and their statement should be determinative of their view, at least, that there's a conflict.</text>

            <text syncTime="2262.818" offset="9217114">No new jurisdictional hurdle needed to be overcome, but the international character of the transaction was to be fully considered and the legislative history explicitly referred to the Timberlane decision as the kind of analysis that might be undertaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.059" offset="9274061">The district court held that this act did not apply, and hence made its findings of effects under the first two steps of Timberlane's rule of reason the governing authority for that court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2299.241" offset="9362772">It perceived these effects to be effects that surpassed this new threshold in the statute and, thus, it gave them such weight that it vitiated the United Kingdom's interest in the course of applying the remainder of the balancing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.017" offset="9425884">We think this was plainly wrong, but we also think the court of appeals decision would be wrong even if there were no conflict and even if the Ninth Circuit hadn't misapplied the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2436.029" offset="9909985">This enables the foreseeability of remote impacts in locales around the world, but it does not mean that reinsurers foresee the possibility of violating the law or of being hailed into courts around the world.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="2517.981" offset="10237770">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.183" offset="10254593">In looking into this case as amicus curiae, what we view as most significant in these complaints are allegations that the collaborators agreed upon an enforcement mechanism, namely the cutting off of reinsurance, to ensure compliance with a privately imposed trade restraint restricting the kinds of commercial liability insurance that would be available, and in the questioning, members of the Court have put their finger on the relevant allegations in the complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.295" offset="10435047">They're on pages 24 and 25 of the Joint Appendix, particularly paragraphs 64 through 69, which shows that the enforcement mechanism of cutting off the availability of reinsurance was allegedly imposed at the behest of the primaries, Hartford and its allies, which were seeking to restrict the kind of coverage being offered by their competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.801" offset="10577048">Now, enforcement mechanisms pose special dangers to competition and to consumer interests, and this is because, in general, the greater the consumer need or desire for particular products or services that the trade restraint withholds, the more likely it is that the restraint will tend to break down through a sort of centrifugal force as individual firms respond to the resulting competitive opportunity posed by these unmet consumer needs, and enforcement mechanisms as part of the conspiracy really presuppose this and are designed to apply countervailing pressure to preserve the effectiveness of the restraint against this centrifugal force, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.077" offset="10838168">And here the allegations go beyond the normal hypothesis that members of the agreement must be restrained from the temptation to break out, and charge that the enforcement mechanism was applied not only to the conspirators themselves, but also to force capitulation by firms that were not parties to the agreement that had resisted Hartford's effort to get the ISO to limit the forms in the same way and, therefore, fairly reading the complaint, that continued to desire to offer the kinds of coverage that the restraint was designed to eliminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.395" offset="11059373">Now, that, to us, is conduct at the core of the exception from McCarran-Ferguson Act immunity that Congress took special care to specify by expressly withholding immunity from any act of boycott, coercion, or intimidation, or agreement to boycott, coerce or intimidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.545" offset="11168043">This is language, as this Court recognized in Barry, that was picked up by Congress from this Court's opinion in South-Eastern Underwriters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.936" offset="11213600">It was the part of the holding of South-Eastern Underwriters that Congress concluded it should preserve in the McCarran-Ferguson Act, and our principal authority for stating that it's conduct at the core of the exception is the way this Court, both in the majority opinion and in the dissenting opinion in St. Paul Insurance v. Barry, construed the exception for boycott coercion or intimidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.328" offset="11371171">It is the one case that this Court has had occasion to address that exception and construe it in some detail.</text>

            <text syncTime="3123.852" offset="12661202">It's the enforcement mechanism that has made this a boycott, and in this case it's because you've got participants at the primary level and there is an enforcement mechanism against their competitors to prevent their competitors from offering certain products.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.213" offset="12742704">You don't really have that kind of disciplining of anyone when only the reinsurers are involved, but when you've got the two-level conspiracy with an enforcement mechanism against competitors at one of the levels, you've converted just a refusal to do business on terms that are unacceptable to the reinsurers into an enforcement mechanism that coerces competitors of some of the collaborators into not being able to compete in ways that they want to compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.492" offset="12919814">Now, since my time is running short, I think I should say a word or two about the comity issue, which is raised with respect to some other counts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.752" offset="12984807">The principal of comity was recognized, even if in a rather rudimentary way, when the Sherman Act was enacted, and the legislative history of the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act of 1982 suggests that Congress thought comity principals could be employed in antitrust litigation in accordance with decisions such as the Ninth Circuit's Timberlane case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.173" offset="13110508">We agree with that if comity is properly conceived and properly cabined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.614" offset="13156274">The important point I want to make is that comity is not an invitation to other nations to decide which of our laws they like or dislike and thereby to determine whether their nationals need or need not comply with particular laws when they're nationals are engaged in commerce in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.662" offset="13256480">It's not a device for ceding to other nations the making of legal policy for engaging in commerce here, but instead comity analysis should apply objective criteria which have been formulated in multifactor tests that we have discussed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.511" offset="13355850">Here, the Ninth Circuit applied its own test in Timberlane, which has been a leading decision on the subject, and we think it reached the correct result in applying the test and, if anything, was too generous to the claim of comity in holding that there was a conflict at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.495" offset="13455847">We have to remember that this was a conspiracy allegedly directed entirely at the U.S. market, where the respondent states claim that Lloyd's does at least 50 percent of its reinsurance business, and the effects to be felt in the U.S. market were very substantial and foreseeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.348" offset="13575278">They have been interestingly documented in one of the amicus briefs in support of the States filed by the service industry counsel, to which I would refer the Court, and there we think that the jurisdiction was properly exercised by the Ninth Circuit in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3393.441" offset="13739641">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.460" offset="13751657">When a group of insurers enlist third parties to refuse to continue to supply their competitors in order to enforce upon them changes in their competitive behavior, this Court has always found that that described a boycott within the meaning of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.056" offset="13834100">In these cases in particular, four primary insurance companies decided that they no longer wanted to write particular coverages, but they also knew that they couldn't simply walk away from those coverages because if their competitors continued to write them, they would lose significant share of the market that they currently possessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.454" offset="13915706">In order to forestall that eventuality, they went to reinsurers, and they went to reinsurers precisely because reinsurance is one of the things that an insurer needs in order to be able to effectively write coverage, reinsurance was at the particular time at issue in these cases in short supply, and reinsurance is not effectively regulated by the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.021" offset="14021972">Thus, it was the specific and best means immediately available by which they could compel their competitors to also cease writing this coverage, and that is precisely the definition of what constitutes a boycott that this Court found in Barry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.233" offset="14098772">Indeed, when this Court offered what described as the generic definition of a boycott, it said it was a method of pressure by withholding or enlisting others to withhold patronage or services from the target, and the purpose of that withholding--</text>

            <text syncTime="3954.164" offset="15982514">Indeed, when you look at the structure of the regulation and you look at the structure of the statute, while the statute may permit the States to allow insurers to cooperate in a variety of efficiency-enhancing means, it expressly prohibits boycott, coercion, and intimidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.495" offset="16063807">It was the fears in Congress born of the experience in the South-East Underwriters case that insurers, because they needed certain levels of cooperation to efficiently function, were in a position of danger, that they had a power through cooperation which could be abused, and the way you abuse it is precisely the way it was abused in South-Eastern Underwriters.</text>

            <text syncTime="4031.098" offset="16290237">Turning to the definition of the phrase, "boycott", one must start with looking at the statute and what the statute itself says.</text>

            <text syncTime="4043.322" offset="16339138">"any act or agreement of boycott, coercion, and intimidation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.041" offset="16358051">It does not offer any adjectives such as "total", "partial", or "discriminatory".</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.611" offset="16384278">It derives those terms expressly from the Sherman Act cases itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4059.581" offset="16404131">Indeed, it comes directly from this Court's language in the South-Eastern Underwriters case, and more specifically it was the congressional purpose to preclude the kind of private regulatory activity that we see in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.377" offset="16467347">In the Barry case, this Court defined "boycott" with reference to the Sherman Act cases, and it did so because it found that the Sherman Act language had been utilized by the Congress and that the particular purpose the Congress had wished to serve derives specifically from this Court's decision in South-Eastern Underwriters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4098.555" offset="16560030">Further, the petitioners cite no case law whatsoever which is contrary to this definition of "boycott" focusing on the use of coercive means.</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.514" offset="16603915">When one looks at the distinction of "partial" and "absolute", one cannot find that as a consistent thread through this Court's antitrust boycott jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4119.822" offset="16645084">Indeed, the only common thread which ties those cases together, if at all, is the notion of coercive enforcement activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4129.595" offset="16684268">This Court specifically noted in Barry both that boycotts were not a unitary phenomenon and that the case law showed a marked lack of uniformity, and it is not a unitary phenomenon, and it shows that marked lack of uniformity precisely because what is a boycott is circumstantial to a significant extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4153.643" offset="16780398">What is coercive and effective against one party in one market circumstance might not be as effective against another party in a different circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.886" offset="16833375">When you look at that definition in relationship to the facts in this case, it is precisely what we've pled here... an agreement by a small group of insurers seeking to preclude their competitors from offering coverages against which they did not wish to compete.</text>

            <text syncTime="4792.247" offset="19334861">Indeed, the test that the Sherman Act cases have applied have generally applied a two-pronged analysis: whether there was an intent to harm American commerce, and whether the conduct charged had a substantial effect on American commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4808.708" offset="19400689">When you look at the facts in this case, Americans went to London to solicit the participation of London reinsurers for the purpose of disciplining American reinsurance markets.</text>

            <text syncTime="4825.754" offset="19468816">If one looks at the nonmarine London agreement 1987, the very words of the agreement itself were,</text>

            <text syncTime="4882.838" offset="19697231">What I would posit to the Court is that, given the international nature of this market and American markets' dependence on it, the statement that the British Government possesses the sole regulatory interest in how business is conducted in that market is misleading and, indeed, false.</text>
            <text syncTime="4904.336" offset="19783226">I would hypothesize the following case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.788" offset="19800990">Assume the British adopted a statute which said that it was in Britain's interest to promote the manufacture of products for sale in the United States which were inherently dangerous and which were not required to be done with adequate safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.267" offset="19870893">I don't think this Court would waste a great deal of time and effort concluding that American State product liability law should apply to that conduct even though the British have articulated a regulatory interest in that conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.378" offset="19939334">When you look at the jurisdictional test which derives from Alcoa, from the Continental Ore case, and the other cases cited in our brief, the notion of comity is inherent in that test because the comity question as a jurisdictional matter is the question of whether the exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable under the circumstance of a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4969.862" offset="20045287">And the way that we have determined reasonableness is by looking to see whether there was an intent to harm American commerce and whether American commerce was substantially affected, and I suggest that to the extent that there is any confusion in the lower courts, it relates not to the intent and effects standard, but a failure to give meaning to the substantiality of the effect before the exercise of jurisdiction is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4999.215" offset="20162733">When you look at the Timberlane case itself, you didn't need a 9-factor or a 7-factor or a 10-factor test to tell you 11/100ths of 1 percent of American lumber coming from Honduras probably wasn't a substantial effect and probably wasn't the sort of circumstance where it would be reasonable for an American court to exercise its jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="5097.776" offset="20556973">It does admit to at least some narrow exceptions, and the exceptions that this Court has recognized are the active State cases where it's narrowly confined to its role as a rule of decision, and we would also submit that circumstances which related to foreign sovereign compulsion might also, as a matter of due process, be cases where jurisdiction might be inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5123.991" offset="20661776">But the level of conflicts posited in this case by the British Government I do not believe are the sort that this Court ought to give deference to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5132.997" offset="20697825">The policy posited by the United Kingdom is one of a system of self-regulation, and thus the British Government is, at best, merely neutral as to whether this conduct occurred or did not occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="5147.173" offset="20754563">It was within the discretion of the actors under that self-regulatory system to decide for themselves whether or not to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5155.463" offset="20787687">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="5161.699" offset="20812660">I think it's critical for the Court to distinguish the seat of distinction between this case and Barry.</text>
            <text syncTime="5166.586" offset="20832199">In Barry, the defendant singled out one group of doctors, treated them differently from everybody else in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.074" offset="20858113">They penalized them by a complete cut-off of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5176.692" offset="20872637">That's so different from this case, where the thing that is alleged is a general change in insurance coverage that applies to everybody in exactly the same way, and in the Barry case this Court said that is a critical distinction, and yet our friends are just overriding that distinction completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="5192.904" offset="20937421">Justice Scalia put his finger on a critical idea as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="5195.856" offset="20949228">That's the solvency point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5197.306" offset="20955079">One theme that goes throughout this legislative history is that if a consumer's house burns down and he can't get his insurance money because the company is insolvent, it is cold comfort to tell that person that vigorous Sherman Act competition has saved him 5 percent on his premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="5212.901" offset="21017460">Congress meant these agreements on terms and coverage that can preserve solvency to be considered by specialized insurance regulators who can weigh these sensitive questions of public policy that were debated a few moments ago.</text>
