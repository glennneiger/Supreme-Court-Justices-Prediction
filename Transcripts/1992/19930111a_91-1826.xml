            <text syncTime="24.657" offset="241644">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="28.579" offset="257422">This case arises out of the provisions of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 that granted amnesty to certain longstanding illegal aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.526" offset="297128">The case presents two class actions challenging regulations the attorney general promulgated to interpret eligibility requirements under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.952" offset="330878">In one case a regulation interpreting a proviso that allowed an alien to gain relief even if he had brief, casual, and innocent absences from the United States, in the other a regulation interpreting the requirement that the aliens' immigration status have been continuously unlawful since 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.822" offset="402349">In each case a class of aliens filed suit in a Federal district court in California and secured a ruling holding the challenged regulations invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.629" offset="437562">Both of the district courts then proceeded to require INS to grant the benefit of the ruling not only to aliens who filed applications before the program expired, but also to aliens who applied after the deadline in May 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.059" offset="491270">The Government appealed and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.362" offset="504540">Those orders have continued in effect while the case has been pending and INS has been obligated to continue accepting applications for the more than 4-1/2 years since May 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.348" offset="544455">It has accepted about 300,000 so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.239" offset="556054">In our view the decision of the court of appeals is wrong for two separate reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.502" offset="573086">First, the district court did not have jurisdiction to review INS determinations regarding whether or not members of the respondent class were eligible for relief under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.458" offset="612896">And second, even if it did have jurisdiction it was improper for the district courts to grant relief to aliens who failed to apply before the program expired in May of 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.766" offset="654170">On the first question the key factor is the framework for judicial and administrative review set forth in section 1255a(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="137.292" offset="692204">On its face that framework bars any immediate judicial review of a decision denying an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.437" offset="716759">Rather, an alien can seek relief from a court only after deportation proceedings have been instituted and completed and the alien is subject to a final order of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.611" offset="757510">Thus although the statute allowed aliens to seek relief from the agency while retaining their confidentiality and anonymity, they could not obtain judicial review of an adverse agency decision without giving up their fugitive status, either by surrendering--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="170.084" offset="823443">Well, now did the... did INS, in your view, have authority to determine that the regulations were invalid in a... in an ordinary proceeding brought by an alien?</text>

            <text syncTime="186.176" offset="887809">INS is bound by regulations that are issued by the attorney general.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="188.816" offset="898362">Right.</text>

          <turn speaker="ronald_j_mann" startTime="189.417" stopTime="243.414">
            <label>Mr. Ronald J. Mann</label>
            <text syncTime="189.417" offset="900766">And so if an alien had filed an application for relief, and many aliens in this situation did, the application would have been denied and undoubtedly the denial would have been affirmed by the legalization appeals unit if the regulation remained valid at the time the appeal was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.099" offset="963459">The regulations were withdrawn before the... just before the application period expired, so some of the adjudications would not yet have been determined by the legalization appeals unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.554" offset="997314">But what that would do is that would place that alien in exactly the same situation as any alien whose application was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.518" offset="1025108">For example, if the INS determined as a fact that the alien first entered the United States in 1983 his application would be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.582" offset="1053425">The LAU, if it agreed that the evidence in the record supported that, would deny the... would deny the appeal and the alien could do nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.858" offset="1082473">If the alien wanted to challenge that, he would have to give himself up and submit to our immigration laws and then challenge it in the court of appeals after deportation proceedings.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="243.414" offset="1116746">Well, didn't we have a virtually identical provision before us in McNary against the Haitian refugees?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ronald_j_mann" startTime="249.806" stopTime="323.306">
            <label>Mr. Ronald J. Mann</label>
            <text syncTime="249.806" offset="1142241">Yes, in... in... in the relevant respects we believe the jurisdictional provisions in McNary were the same as these, and the difference is that this case involves a different type of claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.783" offset="1178186">The claims at issue in McNary were claims that could not have been reviewed in the court of appeals on the administrative record, but the fundamental claim was that INS was deciding... denying applications on the basis of evidence that was not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.651" offset="1229699">And so if the court of appeals had reviewed the administrative record it could not have ascertained whether or not the claim was correct and would not have been able to evaluate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.497" offset="1265017">And if that was the only remedy that the aliens had, they really would not have had effective judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.360" offset="1284452">By contrast, the claims here are that INS would have improperly denied applications for legalization, and the only thing that the court of appeals needs to know to evaluate that claim is the core information that's required to determine whether he's statutorily eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.551" offset="1349236">And that information would be in the administrative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.842" offset="1358431">That's the information that's put on the form I-687, the application that the alien files.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.635" offset="1381628">He would file the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.877" offset="1386539">It would be denied, probably denied by the LAU.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.478" offset="1396988">The court of appeals would have that application and it would be perfectly capable of making its own decision as to whether or not those facts were sufficient to justify relief under the act.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="323.306" offset="1436276">Well, I guess the operative language in section 1255 (a)(f) is a determination respecting an application.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.392" offset="1484654">And it certainly is arguable, anyway, that that means a determination that the INS itself could make.</text>

          <turn speaker="ronald_j_mann" startTime="344.290" stopTime="384.846">
            <label>Mr. Ronald J. Mann</label>
            <text syncTime="344.290" offset="1520181">That's correct, and in our view the determination in this... the determination in this case is the regulation which INS made.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.694" offset="1557797">INS determined that certain things had to be true for an alien to be entitled to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.288" offset="1576188">The determination relates to an application of a member of the respondent class because the only claim that the respondents can make is that if they filed an application it would have been denied, or that they did file an application and that they expected that it would be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.728" offset="1633970">So because they're challenging its effect on them it's a determination respecting each of their individual applications, and that's how we read the statutory language to apply.</text>

I think it was called front desking, that is to say simply not accepting the applications of those that they were satisfied under the regs would fail?</text>
            <text syncTime="399.816" offset="1742326">So that as a matter fact, given the front desking procedure, there is... there was no way that a given applicant could get his application to the point of a final determination, subject to review.</text>

            <text syncTime="431.877" offset="1870535">In our view the jurisdictional question is... this case was filed in November of 1986 several months before the application period started.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.383" offset="1904599">The district court is presented with a complaint and the question is whether it has jurisdiction over that complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.638" offset="1929572">Now, at that time there were 18 months, more or less, maybe 17 months left before the application period was going to expire.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.662" offset="1957680">And we don't think that there's any way that the district court could have determined at that time that there was no way these people could file, particularly if you look at the... so I don't think that's really relevant to the jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.441" offset="2008775">The jurisdictional question, it seems to me, turns on whether this is a... whether the determination they challenged, which is the regulation, is a determination respecting an application in light of the way that this Court interpreted that phrase in McNary.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald J. Mann</label>
            <text syncTime="505.695" offset="2165823">--Well if you're... if you're filing a suit challenging INS's practices of accepting applications... for example, if the complaint isn't that INS has an improper regulation for determining whether you are eligible for relief, but instead that INS... INS officers are refusing to accept applications, it seems to me that that is a... that is a type of claim that arguably might be covered by McNary, but that's not the claim that's before the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.825" offset="2278359">The only people with respect to whom INS appealed in this case are people who did not apply for relief under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.110" offset="2307512">I mean if you look at... and if you look in the record you can see where the district courts defined the groups to whom they extended relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.244" offset="2336037">But we didn't appeal with respect to the people who applied for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.076" offset="2355368">And it's our position, INS's position, that if you went into an INS office and if you attempted to apply for relief and they refused to accept your application... which, as we mentioned in our reply brief, would have violated INS's policies as set forth in the legalization manual... if you did that, we believe that you have, in fact, applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.168" offset="2427779">The statute doesn't say that in order to meet the statutory time deadline you have to force INS to accept your application and put a stamp on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="582.187" offset="2471770">And it's our view that if you walk into INS's offices and you attempt to apply, it's one thing if they say we don't think you're going to get relief and so you shouldn't waste the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.742" offset="2510013">But if they say no, we refuse to accept your application, we will not take it, you have applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.376" offset="2528612">And there are cases that are cited in both parties' briefs in which INS did similar things and INS has granted relief to those people.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.970" offset="2554943">For example a person--</text>
            <text syncTime="604.280" offset="2560168">--On the second question, which is what I was talking about with Justice Souter, whether or not it was proper for the district courts to accept jurisdiction over these cases in the first place, it certainly was improper for them to grant relief to individuals who did not satisfy the requirements for relief that Congress articulated in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.905" offset="2650656">The first of the four statutory requirements for relief is set forth in section 1255a(a)(1), and that requirement is that the alien have filed an application during a specified 12-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.632" offset="2693601">Because the Government did not appeal the district court's judgments with respect to aliens who filed applications, as I just mentioned, none of the respondents before this Court satisfied that requirement and thus they are not eligible for relief because of section 1255a(a)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="652.762" offset="2754101">The provision that they're seeking to avoid is not a statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.074" offset="2771342">This is not an individualized filing requirement that can be subject to equitable tolling.</text>

            <text syncTime="907.062" offset="3771309">--Well, in most cases I believe that's true because the requirements for relief are fairly generalized; you have to be here since 1982 unlawfully and you have to have not left since 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.091" offset="3819374">The brief, casual and innocent absence actually is one of the most soft provisions in the statute, because there obviously is some play in that particular phrase could mean, but being here since 1982 is a clear provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.118" offset="3875486">But there are a lot of things that... legal questions that arose under the act and some of them... most of them were decided by regulations, but some of them were decided by the LAU.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.785" offset="3906206">Talking about the second question again, as I mentioned the statute has three different time deadlines that aliens have to meet to fall within the class of aliens who are eligible for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.882" offset="3958555">They have to have been here continuously and unlawfully since 1982, they have to have been here continuously since the act was passed in 1986, and they have to have sought relief within the first 18 months after the act was passed in 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.442" offset="4012785">Now, under that scheme respondents' failure to seek relief before the statute expired cannot be justified on the basis of their individual circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.427" offset="4044759">They just didn't make themselves eligible for relief, any more than a person who didn't come to the United States until 1983 would be eligible for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.893" offset="4074643">The seriousness with which Congress viewed this particular requirement, the timely filing requirement, is particularly clear from section 1255a(f)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="993.589" offset="4117379">Although subdivisions (3) and (4) of 1255a(f) require judicial review and a level of administrative appellate review generally for determinations about eligibility, they expressly bar any judicial or even any administrative review with respect to an application that's denied as being untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.690" offset="4193866">Now in light of that, we think it's particularly inappropriate for a court to believe that it's empowered to extend the deadline, when Congress has attempted to put the... that particular question beyond judicial review entirely.</text>

            <text syncTime="1065.166" offset="4403681">There's a distinction to us between an individual filing deadline and a statute of limitations, for example, which will say you have to file for relief within 6 years after your cause of action arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.674" offset="4449761">And that type of deadline turns on an individual's fact circumstances; when did the cause of action arise?</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.758" offset="4474108">And that's the type of deadline that we believe is at issue in Irwin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.780" offset="4490199">Now sometimes it may be a statute of limitations, sometimes it may be called something else, but that's one type of statutes to which we think equitable tolling generally applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.084" offset="4519352">This case and Pangilinan, however, involve something different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.448" offset="4532831">In these cases Congress has established a program and says the program is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.450" offset="4552893">The program in the Pangilinan case ended shortly after World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.673" offset="4565745">The program in this case ended on May 4th, 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.656" offset="4581732">And we don't think that that type of deadline should be subject to tolling, because it's... it's a requirement for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.790" offset="4606183">Now, even if it is subject to equitable tolling, it seems to us that the... that this is not remotely the type of case as to which equitable tolling would be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.285" offset="4644217">What... what INS and the attorney general did that is offered as a justification for equitable tolling is that INS issued regulations explaining the circumstances under which it believed people would be eligible for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.713" offset="4701895">It said if you were gone from the United States without advance permission, you're not eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.657" offset="4717673">Now, whether that was right or wrong, that's just a regulation explaining the circumstances in which you may or may not be eligible for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.323" offset="4748393">And what respondents should have done and what anybody who wants a benefit that's offered by the United States Government should do, is you apply for the benefit and if you don't agree with the agency's interpretation you challenge it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.619" offset="4789562">And these people had exactly the same opportunity for judicial review as everybody else under the act, and they chose not to apply and so they're not eligible for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.415" offset="4828746">I would point out that quite a number of the people who were in this situation did apply for relief and they've already gotten relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.300" offset="4856227">And even if this suit had not been filed in the district court, they would have gotten relief when the injunction... when the regulations were withdrawn, because INS would have had to given the relief sooner or later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.736" offset="4898023">When the person got to the court of appeals they could not have deported them because the court of appeals would have ruled that they were entitled to legalization based on the fact that INS had withdrawn the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.272" offset="4932191">The real reason respondents are unable to secure relief is that they declined to take advantage of the 12-month opportunity Congress offered them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.258" offset="4968135">You have to remember this was an extraordinary statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.400" offset="4980674">Congress was faced with a huge problem involving a very large number of undocumented aliens, all of whom were illegally here in violation of our immigration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.547" offset="5017246">And we had... Congress had tried for years to deal with the problem, and they decided that the best way to deal with it was to enact a program that was going to allow these people in a... for a short time period to seek relief, come forward, become lawful members of our community, and join this country's polity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.767" offset="5086104">And they... in order to get people to apply they took the extraordinary step of allowing them to apply for relief without giving up their right to remain here as anonymous fugitives if the agency denied them relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.245" offset="5140021">They could apply for relief, and under the confidentiality provisions INS could not use that information to deport them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.949" offset="5162904">And the information on the legalization application, if it was sufficient for relief, would almost certainly make them deportable because, by definition, they had to be here illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.346" offset="5196446">And they allowed you to apply to the agency anonymously and then you'd get a level of administrative review, appellate review within the agency, but they stopped short of allowing you judicial review while you remained a fugitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.754" offset="5242108">If you wanted to go to court and burden the Federal courts, which have plenty of things to do at the district court level, you had to make a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.869" offset="5278574">And the choice was that you thought you were entitled to legalization and you wanted to come forward, submit to this country's laws, and join its citizenry and see how... whether the courts believed you were eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.295" offset="5316191">And if they said that you were eligible, you would win.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.345" offset="5328416">There'd be one judicial proceeding and you would win and you would get to stay here lawfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.277" offset="5340119">And if you lost, you would have to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.270" offset="5352135">And that's the scheme that Congress enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.723" offset="5361957">It is a strict limitation on judicial review, but it's a strict limitation on judicial review that's coupled with a remarkably generous program granting amnesty to a very large class of unlawful residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.840" offset="5414411">And the suggestion that INS implemented the program very harshly really isn't borne out by the historical facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.285" offset="5440220">If you look, INS went with their publicity programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.707" offset="5457879">They received many more applications than Congress anticipated; under this program alone more than 1.7 million... and about 3 million under the two programs together, the SAW program at issue in McNary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1384.355" offset="5680442">--Well, actually, if you compare that provision of the... of IRCA with a corollary provision about exclusion, I think the regulation actually comes pretty close to... to being correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.639" offset="5717641">What you have to remember is that if the person entered with a false... with false documents in that manner it would be fair to say the person entered by fraud, and a person who enters by fraud is excludable unless he can secure a waiver from the attorney general.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.379" offset="5768527">And so what the regulation effectively did is by saying that the people can't come in at all, it should have said the person is ineligible for relief unless he can secure a waiver for the fraud from the attorney general.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.297" offset="5812204">And that regulation was overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.857" offset="5818473">Now, I would also point out that the regulations had to be drafted with some haste and INS made some mistakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.302" offset="5844282">But the fact that INS made some mistakes in the regulation does not excuse individuals from seeking relief and making themselves eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.697" offset="5877823">In our view that's just like Schweiker v. Hansen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.669" offset="5889735">In that case, you'll recall, a disabled individual went into an HHS office and said, I would like to get disability benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.684" offset="5921814">And the person said, you're not eligible for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.884" offset="5930591">Incorrectly... it was conceded that that advice was incorrect, and the person, relying solely on that advice, didn't apply for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.420" offset="5960788">About a year later they discovered it was incorrect and they went back and applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.611" offset="5977507">And because they had not applied... there was a substantive requirement that you apply... they had forever lost... forever lost the monetary disability benefits that they could have gotten if they had applied initially, and they could not get that money back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.633" offset="6033618">It was... it was forever lost to them because they failed to apply at the right time, and their sole basis for failing to apply was that a Government person misinterpreted the eligibility requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.348" offset="6072488">That's very much like this case, in our view, and that's why we believe it's a fundamental principle of administrative law that you can't just accept a Government agent telling you that you're not eligible for relief and then decline to make yourself eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.307" offset="6128286">It would be like if INS had told these people they weren't eligible and so they decided, well, we'll leave after 1986 and go to Mexico for 6 months since we can't get legalization, then when the regulation is invalid come back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.284" offset="6172171">It's certainly clear that a court would not order INS to grant relief to such a person, and we really don't see any difference between that case and this one.</text>

            <text syncTime="1631.907" offset="6670692">It is not disputed that IRCA provided very very important benefits, beginning with, at the foundation of it, an extensive education and outreach program mandated by Congress so that aliens could learn the requirements to obtain legalization through the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.934" offset="6766823">Also, Congress provided for a stay of deportation and work authorization pending the determination made in the administrative process on an application, a very important provision because at the same time Congress enacted a prohibition on the employment of undocumented aliens, so work authorization was particularly important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.439" offset="6864834">And it's not disputed that legalization is a very important benefit to this class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.965" offset="6898898">With legalization they would no longer need fear reporting crime when they were crime victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.682" offset="6929827">They would no longer need fear reporting violations of labor laws and a myriad of other things that we take for granted in the United States, because contacting Government would no longer have that fear of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.878" offset="6974548">And ultimately the most priceless benefit that was to be provided through legalization is U.S. citizenship, because after a period of time as temporary resident aliens they could acquire the opportunity to ultimately become citizens of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.278" offset="7040168">Now, the Government said that 300,000 applications have been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.406" offset="7072664">That is not precisely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.735" offset="7077993">The stay orders that have been issued have allowed, in essence, people who believe that they're class members to opt in and demonstrate under the particular standards that they are class members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.026" offset="7135149">INS has agreed that 78,000 of the 300,000 plus who have sought class membership are preliminarily class members, and have granted them work authorization and a temporary stay of deportation pending the outcome of appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.438" offset="7204844">Let me turn first to jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.760" offset="7218114">The issue in this case involves precisely the same text involving judicial review, a determination respecting an application, that was involved in McNary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.957" offset="7270881">Thus it raises the same narrow question that was raised in McNary, whether Congress intended to preclude truly meaningful judicial review and truly meaningful judicial relief in these two class actions, raising generic, statutory, and constitutional claims for which an abuse of discretion standard of review that is in (f)(4) is particularly inappropriate, as this Court held in McNary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.058" offset="7391254">Secondly, as in McNary, the holding that special review applies only to judicial review of individual denials of applications is the second issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.226" offset="7455933">It applies with full force here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.020" offset="7467113">These cases did not seek judicial review of individual applications, nor did the aliens in these cases seek orders granting them legalization or that would entitle them to legalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.967" offset="7518940">They only sought to have corrected one... in each particular case to have corrected one standard among a myriad of standards that would be applied to their applications.</text>

            <text syncTime="2974.269" offset="12040109">The regulation interpreted that statute in the manner suggested by Justice O'Connor earlier, that if a person came through with fraudulently obtained documents, that the facial validity of their entry then converted their residence into lawful residence and it broke the continued period of unlawful residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.285" offset="12140210">The second parenthetical phrase in that particular subsection said people who have continuous physical presence within the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3363.416" offset="13596694">I'd like to clarify... I didn't really realize there was much that needed to be clarified... what our position is on the so-called front desking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.200" offset="13627832">There are several points about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.349" offset="13632429">The first is I don't really think that has anything to do with the jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.915" offset="13654686">The district courts in this case concluded that they had jurisdiction over claims that certain INS regulations regarding eligibility requirements were invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.680" offset="13693765">We believe that is incorrect and that's what the first question in this case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.003" offset="13715081">The second question in this case is even if we're wrong on that, was it proper for the district courts to grant relief to people who did not file in a timely manner?</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.112" offset="13759489">Now, it's our understanding that the front desking argument is relevant to that, on the idea that that establishes some sort of affirmative INS misconduct that might justify equitable tolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.751" offset="13802016">As I mentioned earlier, we don't believe equitable tolling applies to this type of statute, but even if it does we don't believe this is the right type of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.028" offset="13835139">What... what we have conceded, though, is... we did not appeal from the district court with respect to people who applied for relief largely because they were going to get relief sooner or later anyway, so there's no reason for us to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.225" offset="13887907">If we withdrew the regulations the people would eventually secure legalization, and so there's no reason for us to continue to litigate about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.080" offset="13915388">It is our view that there are... there are some sets of fact patterns where the person did not force INS to accept his application that will constitute applying for relief under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.179" offset="13963766">People who never went to an INS office, in our view, cannot conceivably fall into that fact situation.</text>
