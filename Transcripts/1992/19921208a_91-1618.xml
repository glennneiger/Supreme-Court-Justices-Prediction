            <label>Mr. N. Victor Goodman</label>
            <text syncTime="12.509" offset="189260">Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.343" offset="204620">This Court has repeatedly recognized that state redistricting bodies are best situated to identify and then reconcile traditional State policies with Federal constitutional and statutory requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.241" offset="256238">This Court has long held that redistricting and reapportioning legislative bodies is a legislative task which the Federal courts should make every effort not to preempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.667" offset="297930">The district court in this case made every effort to preempt the legislative reapportionment adopted by the Ohio Apportionment Board on February 18 of this year, which we have referred to in these proceedings as amendment D.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.135" offset="351846">During the course of my argument this morning, I plan to discuss each of the district court's intrusions upon Ohio's apportionment process.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.361" offset="388731">First, the lower court preempted Ohio's redistricting efforts by improperly shifting the burden of proof to the apportioning persons to justify their apportionment plan under the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.970" offset="439095">Second, the district court found, in the face of unprecedented cooperation and consultation with the African American community in our State, that the Apportionment Board intentionally discriminated against minorities in violations of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.220" offset="500117">And third, and only as an afterthought in the course of their March 19 opinion where the district court denied our application for a stay pending appeal to this Court, the district court found that the appellants had violated the one person-one vote rule of the Fourteenth Amendment by adhering to a provision of the Ohio constitution which permitted deviations from ideal population of plus or minus 10 percent in the pursuit of our Ohio constitution's policy of respecting county boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.630" offset="625818">We would respectfully suggest to this Court that the record in this case is complete and clear and that none of the findings of violations made by the district court are supported in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.168" offset="671898">Accordingly, we would respectfully request this Court to remand this case to the district court with instructions to enter judgment in favor of the Appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.543" offset="709410">With respect to the Voting Rights Act, we believe that the findings and conclusions of the district court are both legally and factually incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.480" offset="749221">The district court held that the apportioning persons in our State were automatically forbidden to create majority-minority districts in the absence of what would amount to be a judicial finding of a violation of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.420" offset="812960">The district court held that the apportioning board could not implement the State's policy of attempting to avoid the dilution of minority voting strength in their redistricting plan without first proving that the 1981 plan of apportionment violated the Voting Rights Act or that the plan which they adopted on February 18 did not violate the Voting Rights Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="343.495" offset="1513250">In fact, the record is clear that the Ohio Chapter of the NAACP branches supported the plan before this Court as it affects the minority community in its entirety.</text>

            <text syncTime="1660.408" offset="6780894">The stage on which this was played out in Ohio in 1991 was that there were 11 black legislators who had been repeatedly elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.698" offset="6826034">They had been repeatedly elected with very large majorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.120" offset="6843693">They were... seven of them were elected from districts where there were less than 50 percent black population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.829" offset="6886534">The court found that there was no racial block voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.457" offset="6901058">The experts on both sides agreed with that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.341" offset="6916627">The experts for the appellants found that in the period 1986 to 1990 the white crossover vote was in the magnitude of 60 percent or greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.469" offset="6965110">Our expert found coalitional voting throughout the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.773" offset="6986321">That finding was supported by the fact that blacks had been repeatedly elected with 35 percent of the population, and they had done that over a period of 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.381" offset="7040761">Now, into this particular breach, the appellants stepped and said we must create as many majority-minority districts as we possibly can.</text>

            <label>Mr. N. Victor Goodman</label>
            <text syncTime="3400.102" offset="13739706">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.145" offset="13747856">If I might, I would like to clear up the record because, as I listened to Mr. Gilliam, I wasn't sure I was hearing the same case that we're before this Court on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.692" offset="13785995">In the first place, in answer to your question, Mr. Chief Justice, the district court abstained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.415" offset="13808878">The Ohio Supreme Court found that the plan did comport with the Ohio Constitution, and there is no other decision of any court to conflict with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.301" offset="13844509">Secondly, with respect to the questions of political gerrymandering, the district court did not find, even though it was raised in the course of their amended complaint, that there was a political gerrymandering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.657" offset="13885887">And I believe yesterday this Court affirmed the decision of the district court in Wepron.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.481" offset="13909188">And I believe that the reason that the district court did not make a political gerrymandering finding under the Fourteenth Amendment is because after the election, November the 3rd, the Democrats maintained control of the House of Representatives, they picked up one additional African American seat, and the Republicans lost the seat in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.542" offset="13977420">And therefore, there is no degradation of anyone's political influence on the process as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.054" offset="13999467">And when the Court has, as I'm sure it has already, had an opportunity to look at the charts, which appear on pages 177 and 260 of the appendix, the Court will find that the Democrat plan that was submitted contained six majority-minority districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.917" offset="14074909">The plan that is before this Court has five majority-minority districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.951" offset="14091105">And the chart that we appended to our reply brief, chart la, will show that the complaint that was made that we decrease the number of 10 percent districts... in fact, the apportioning persons created 21 districts of 10 percent or more; the Democrat plan, only 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.744" offset="14174279">So, I think when the Court reviews the facts of this case... and it is not, by the way, a strict scrutiny case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.748" offset="14202282">There's not even a citation of Croson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.401" offset="14212836">But in any event, we believe that the facts of this case show that they did not meet the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.896" offset="14242824">They did not show that the plan which was adopted and before this Court, known as amendment D, in any way diluted the voting strength of the black community in our State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.162" offset="14279918">They did not show that there was any invidious discrimination under the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.466" offset="14301130">This Court's opinion, as I said earlier, in Carey supports us in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.367" offset="14320774">Yes, we did use race, but we had to because of the residence of a black community in the urban areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.934" offset="14359017">There was no way that we could not have taken race into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.397" offset="14372810">And with respect to the Fourteenth Amendment claim, Your Honor, it is clearly and simply a one person-one vote claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.281" offset="14396424">It was made in passing in their March 19 opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.734" offset="14410217">It was sort of like pin the tail on the donkey, or it may have been pin the tail on the Republicans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.796" offset="14430488">But we have shown that there was a rational State basis, namely, our constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.708" offset="14450132">There is no other plan that was available that could have met the one man-one vote requirements of our Constitution, and there was no builtin bias because we created--</text>
