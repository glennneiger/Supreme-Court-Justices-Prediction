            <text syncTime="1605.457" offset="6558688">The answer to the question is the trustee could have and it was... within his duty as a fiduciary could have rejected this property if he thought it was an inappropriate contribution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.842" offset="6652311">When ERISA was passed in 1974, there were three agencies involved in the enforcement and regulation of ERISA: the Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service, and the PBGCA... the PBGC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.711" offset="6715736">Sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.322" offset="6718139">The... originally the IRS was given regulatory authority under 4975, the section at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.397" offset="6750531">It was also given regulatory authority under section 412, which is the section that places the obligation on an employer with respect to a defined benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.445" offset="6790655">In 1978, pursuant to reorg plan 4, which is cited in both briefs, the IRS and the Department of Labor divided up responsibility for various portions of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.833" offset="6840183">Under that division of authority, the Department of Labor was given regulatory authority under 4975, certain portions of it, including the two that are relevant here, (c)(1)(A) and (f)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.840" offset="6892219">The IRS retained regulatory authority under section 412, the obligation setting section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.505" offset="6918969">With that background in mind, let's talk about what the three agencies have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.849" offset="6944255">The Department of Labor has never issued regulations under 4975(c)(1)(A) or (f)(3) indicating that noncash contributions to defined benefit plans were intended to be a prohibited sale or exchange.</text>

            <text syncTime="1749.381" offset="7134427">One, under the Department's own procedures, private parties are not entitled to rely upon opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.096" offset="7169326">Only the parties in the opinion are entitled to rely on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.228" offset="7181865">So, in a sense, what the IRS is stating is that this taxpayer ought to be bound by an advisory opinion, with respect to which, under the Department's own rules, this taxpayer could not rely upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.566" offset="7227214">Second, and perhaps more important, the Department of Labor '81 advisory opinion contains within it a false assumption, and that assumption is that code section 412 imposes a cash obligation upon the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.287" offset="7290012">The way that advisory opinion analyzes the issue, it states that the transfer of property to a plan that has a legal right to receive cash is tantamount to a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.843" offset="7336301">Whether or not there is a cash obligation is answered by code section 412.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.437" offset="7358662">That is the code section that the IRS, not the Department of Labor, has regulatory power over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.291" offset="7382067">And that would lead you then to ask what is the IRS' administrative position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.895" offset="7404533">Like the Department of Labor, the IRS has issued no regulations whatsoever indicating that a transfer of noncash property to a defined benefit plan is a prohibited sale or exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.064" offset="7461166">However, the IRS has not been silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.828" offset="7472242">First, in 1978, a taxpayer in a private letter ruling asked the IRS to rule on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.730" offset="7499827">The IRS stated that it was an issue that could not be reasonably resolved without the issuance of regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1879.535" offset="7654995">It seems to me that we have an opinion that is wrong, that is a private opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.060" offset="7681117">We have the IRS, through its manual, telling agents that the rules are exactly the opposite, and we have the PBGC, which really had no administrative position at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1922.162" offset="7825522">I would, however, to continue to respond to your question, state that we have a disagreement with Mr. Wright... a terrible name for an opponent to have, Mr. Wright--</text>

            <text syncTime="2166.133" offset="8801457">Let me talk then about why we believe that they are not prohibited transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.786" offset="8816085">Justice Stevens asked a question which I believe Mr. Wright has answered absolutely inconsistent with the Government's position both in its brief here and in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.083" offset="8861225">The question asked was whether in a defined benefit plan, if a year's minimum funding requirement was $100,000 and the taxpayer contributed property, five separate parcels that were each equal to $100,000, which parts of those would be a prohibited sale or exchange and which would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.118" offset="8945339">It is the Government's position that the first piece, the first $100,000 worth would be a prohibited transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.142" offset="8977522">However, it is the Government's position that the other four pieces would not be prohibited transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.226" offset="9001764">And even though for income tax purposes, all five of those are treated as sales or exchanges for income tax purposes and in each of the five cases, the taxpayer would have to pay a capital gain on his income tax return, just as... the way Keystone did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.267" offset="9077937">The problem with the... the reason the Government reaches this position is exactly because of the existence of (f)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.572" offset="9103223">(f)(3) states that a transfer of property subject to a mortgage will be treated... shall be treated I believe the words are... as a sale or exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.700" offset="9147736">The necessary implication on the face of the statute is that if it is not, it is not intended to be a sale or exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.315" offset="9174172">Thus, the Government is looking for some meaning for (f)(3) that is consistent with a transfer of noncash property being a prohibited sale or exchange when it is an exchange for a minimum funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.754" offset="9231955">And the distinction that you have drawn is exactly where they draw the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.637" offset="9247419">What says the Government is that the first piece is an exchange for a cash obligation, the minimum standard requirement for that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.643" offset="9283468">Therefore, that's a sale or exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.125" offset="9293395">However, the other four pieces are not for that year's cash obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.208" offset="9313770">Therefore, those are not prohibited sales or exchanges under (c)(1)(A), and that is the slice that (f)(3) was intended to pick up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.295" offset="9346058">We would submit two answers to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.877" offset="9360373">One, hard to believe that this is what Congress had in mind without a single word in the legislative history speaking of this differentiation about the two types of contribution under code section 412.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.965" offset="9416797">Moreover, we would suggest that code section 412 does not impose a cash obligation on the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.379" offset="9446368">What the words of 412 state specifically is that the employer must satisfy a minimum funding standard, and that is specifically defined by 412(a) with the following language: a plan... and I will quote... shall have satisfied the minimum funding standard for such year for a plan year if at the end of such plan year the plan does not have an accumulated funding deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.189" offset="9557650">Then in 412(b) the code states how you determine whether there is an accumulated funding deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.963" offset="9588787">One of the things that happens in making this determination is there are credits provided to and charges against the plan's assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.880" offset="9620448">One of the credits is for the amount contributed by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.201" offset="9637689">What the IRS alleges... and I would point out to page 5 in their brief... is that the allowance... or the statement in 412(b) that provides a credit for the amount... and the IRS puts the words amount in quotes... of contribution by the employer, that is the item that provides the monetary obligation or the dollar obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.038" offset="9745104">That is the beginning point of their substantive argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.431" offset="9758583">What the IRS fails to point out and totally ignores are the two words immediately following the word amount, which they put in quote, and those amounts... those words are the amounts considered contributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.468" offset="9810724">We would submit that the IRS is absolutely incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.654" offset="9831517">The two words I have just added, which are in the code, make it clear that Congress must have thought that something other than cash was going to be contributed in discharge of the minimum funding standard, otherwise the words amount considered contributed would have no meaning.</text>
