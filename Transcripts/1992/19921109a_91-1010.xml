            <text syncTime="151.958" offset="732821">I think that the question comes to this Court on the assumption that the merits of the claim, going to the appealability issue, that the claim is meritorious, and the only question then is whether the denial of that assumedly meritorious claim should be immediately appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.067" offset="797187">The First Circuit held that the denial of sovereign immunity is not a collateral order, and its only rationale was that the Eleventh Amendment in its view protects only a state's interest in avoiding the imposition of monetary judgments and interests that can be vindicated by appeal after trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.845" offset="868344">Our position is that the First Circuit was wrong because it misunderstood the basic character of Eleventh Amendment immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.249" offset="893944">The rationale is squarely contradicted by this Court's repeated holdings that apply the Eleventh Amendment to bar equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.271" offset="929993">Cases as far back as Ex parte Ayers and more recently Alabama against Pugh and Cory against White directly hold that the Eleventh Amendment immunity, as the language of the Amendment itself requires, goes beyond protecting against monetary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.197" offset="989762">More broadly, the First Circuit's holding was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.649" offset="1003554">My central point is that the Eleventh Amendment immunity, where it applies, must be viewed as protecting a state's right not to be sued.</text>

            <text syncTime="243.615" offset="1099371">The state was, and the Department of Corrections, and this Court I think summarily ordered the dismissal of both of those parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.470" offset="1134793">And the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority claims to be an arm of the state in the same sense as any department of the state would be, notwithstanding its somewhat different form of organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.861" offset="1184426">The First Circuit's contrary view rested on a mistake in treating a doctrine that overrides the Eleventh Amendment, the Ex parte Young doctrine, as if it changed the nature of the immunity where the immunity is not overridden.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.436" offset="1238656">And a right not to be tried, where finally denied by the district court, presents an appealable collateral order.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.173" offset="1265615">Like the First Circuit, I am focusing on the nature of the Eleventh Amendment right, because all of the other elements of a collateral order are clearly satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.629" offset="1303440">First, an order like the one here is a final rejection of the claim of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.932" offset="1324651">There wasn't anything tentative about the district court decision, and nothing later in the litigation could be expected to alter it.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.336" offset="1350251">There is therefore no risk that appellate review now either will be advisory or will have to be repeated later.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.173" offset="1377628">Second, the issue whether the Authority is an arm of the state is completely separate from and collateral to the merits of the litigation, whether there has been a breach of contract and if so what damages may have resulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.667" offset="1427574">There is therefore no risk that the court of appeals will be less than fully able to decide the immunity issue before the merits have been resolved.</text>

            <text syncTime="334.606" offset="1463414">I gather from the opinion of the First Circuit in this case, Mr. Taranto, that they may have felt differently about it than you do.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.759" offset="1487969">Isn't there some expressions in that opinion that it's a very sketchy record that they have to go on?</text>

            <text syncTime="347.746" offset="1515972">I don't think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.282" offset="1522033">The First Circuit did not, as I recall, comment on the merits of the claim of immunity, and the district court's decision turned on one simple fact, the potential monetary liability of the Commonwealth for any judgment in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.708" offset="1591832">The First Circuit in an earlier case had expressed some doubt about the claim of PRASA to sovereign immunity, but that I think cannot be overplayed in its significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.552" offset="1643136">The First Circuit with respect to the Tourism Company in Puerto Rico expressed quite similar doubts, only 2 years later upon full examination of the issue to find that the Tourism Company was indeed an arm of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.442" offset="1690679">I don't think that there is anything less than complete about the record given the factors that go into the arm of the state analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.215" offset="1725788">This Court in I think its two most extensive analyses of that issue, the Lake Country Estates case and the Mount Healthy case, noted that the factors essentially turn on the state's legal treatment of the entity, who appoints the governing board of the entity, whether it is declared to be performing a private or a governmental function, whether it is declared to be an instrumentality, what the financial relationship is, whether there is tax immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.667" offset="1851593">These are matters that in general at least can be determined from looking at the statutes of Puerto Rico.</text>

            <text syncTime="451.231" offset="1929856">The only issue is whether the denial of the claim that PRASA is an arm of the state is immediately appealable under the Cohen standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.837" offset="1964338">And not only here was the denial final, the district court said PRASA is not an arm of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.073" offset="1989206">Whether it's determined to have breached a contract or imposed any damages can't change that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.077" offset="2021285">It is obviously collateral to those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.129" offset="2033510">And finally, the issue is obviously both not a matter for district court discretion, after all PRASA either is or is not an arm of the state, and it is also important.</text>

            <text syncTime="499.045" offset="2121177">I think complexity is no more a problem here than it is in double jeopardy or official immunity cases where some significant amount of legal analysis may be required to identify what the state of the law was at the time of the defendant's conduct, or even in the speech or debate context, whether a particular aide is serving as an alter ego of a member of Congress or whether the member was performing a legislative versus a political function.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.695" offset="2227757">These are issues that, while they may have several factors involved in them, do not involve any district court discretion and so can be decided de novo by a court of appeals as a matter of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="613.013" offset="2576962">Because the nature of the sovereign immunity claim in an Eleventh Amendment context is different from the sovereign immunity claim for the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.452" offset="2614787">When sovereign immunity is claimed by a state, or Puerto Rico, what it is claiming is that another sovereign has no authority to call it to the bar of the court and demand that it answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.592" offset="2667345">The sovereign immunity claim of the United States in its own courts is, does not involve the underlying dignitary interest of one sovereign demanding that another answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.333" offset="2710291">So that the Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity interest is much more akin to the foreign sovereign immunity interest where the law is I think uniformly clear in the lower courts that a denial of foreign sovereign immunity is immediately appealable because of the underlying purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.010" offset="2776955">And this Court last term in the Argentina against Weltover case indeed ruled on the merits of a foreign sovereign immunity claim where the order came up from the district court on a collateral order without questioning the propriety of that jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="735.903" offset="3068586">But on the third factor as well, the question of whether a denial is unreviewable after the final judgment, in turn I think goes back to the question of what the nature of the right is, whether it's a right not to be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.662" offset="3123652">And in the foreign sovereign immunity and state sovereign immunity context the reason I think we know that it is such a right is that the underlying interest is present from the beginning of the lawsuit, that one sovereign through its courts not essentially fail to respect the dignity of another sovereign.</text>

            <text syncTime="807.815" offset="3356246">As far as I am aware the only full discussion of this issue in the First Circuit is in the Libby against Marshall case.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.121" offset="3385399">That's the case that the court below in this case relied on, and that case doesn't, as I recall, contain any extensive discussion of any argument about the dignitary interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.428" offset="3438689">It simply looks at Ex parte Young and Edelman against Jordan, concludes that as a practical matter there is not really much left to the Eleventh Amendment after those cases except an interest in avoiding monetary judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.986" offset="3492919">That I think is where it went wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.438" offset="3506712">The Young and Edelman doctrines do not rest on the judgment that the nature of the Eleventh Amendment immunity is somehow limited to a protection against certain judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.179" offset="3557703">They reflect a decision that because of the needs of the Federal system, whatever the Eleventh Amendment immunity is, it has to be overridden in certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.351" offset="3594379">And one primary indication of that is that after Edelman came down the argument was in fact presented to this Court that Edelman's focus on monetary relief really did change the nature of the Eleventh Amendment immunity and rendered it merely a limit on monetary judgments, and this Court explicitly rejected that argument in Cory against White and implicitly did so in Alabama against Pugh.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.431" offset="3678702">It would also, I think, be a mistake to overread Young and Edelman because those cases, after all, apply in only one type of Eleventh Amendment case, only in official capacity suits brought against state officials under Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.775" offset="3736067">The whole Young-Edelman distinction based on monetary relief has no application in a case like this one for at least two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.880" offset="3764488">One, it's not brought against state officials, and second, it is brought under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.582" offset="3779326">So I think where the First Circuit went wrong was in misreading one limitation on one class of cases that raise Eleventh Amendment issues as transforming the nature of the underlying interest protected by the Eleventh Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="927.592" offset="3835332">Would the distinction you have just drawn, Mr. Taranto, lead to a different result as to appealability in official capacity suits against individuals as opposed to suits against an entity like this one?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard G. Taranto</label>
            <text syncTime="940.566" offset="3887264">I think that the answer would be the same, that when a individual state, when a state official is sued in his or her official capacity and the claim is, and that official says this suit is improper because the claim is barred by Edelman against Jordan, is really a claim for retrospective monetary relief, that what that claim means is that the state official is saying I am the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.281" offset="3982036">And when the state's official says I am the state, that means that the state is asserting a right not to be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.121" offset="4013487">It is true in that circumstance that there is a different issue presented about whether the claim about the nature of the relief is wholly collateral to the merits of the litigation, an issue that's not at all presented when the claim is made by a state entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.130" offset="4077435">But I do think that the answer would end up being the same because in that case, as in this, the Court need not determine the facts, what the defendant did, or the law in the sense of whether those, that conduct violated any applicable legal norm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.627" offset="4155489">The basic sources for determining that the right at issue here is a right not to be tried begin with the language of the Eleventh Amendment itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.983" offset="4196867">That language focuses on protecting states from the very bringing of the lawsuit and from the entire process of litigation, and not just from the judgment, when it speaks of the whole judicial power being excluded from a suit when it is commenced and while it is prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.877" offset="4268442">This Court's opinions also repeatedly treat the right as a right not to be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.598" offset="4295296">All other circuits except the First that have addressed this issue, eight now in number, agree that an Eleventh Amendment immunity claim raises a right not to be tried and is therefore immediately appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.156" offset="4353602">And, as I noted, the closest analogy, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, is treated uniformly the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.643" offset="4387561">I'd like to make one final point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.678" offset="4399682">The dignitary interest that underlies the claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity must be treated as real and important even though it is necessarily somewhat abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.616" offset="4443463">That's why the states reacted so swiftly to Chisolm against Georgia, why framers like Madison and Hamilton and Chief Justice Marshall made such a point of reassuring the states that their sovereign immunity would be respected under the Constitution, and it is why this Court has kept the Ex parte Young doctrine a limited one and has set high standards for finding a waiver or congressional abrogation of the immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.601" offset="4543355">If the immunity is important in all of those respects, then in Cohen's terms it is too important to be denied review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.171" offset="4573657">For those reasons we suggest that the First Circuit was wrong and that its holding should be reversed so that the very harm the immunity protects against will not be irreparably suffered before an appeal can be taken.</text>

            <text syncTime="1140.838" offset="4688282">The respondent urges two basic positions upon the Court today with all due respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.640" offset="4711479">First we urge that this Court find that the Eleventh Amendment is a fiscally driven jurisdictional limitation on the Article III powers of the Federal courts, and that amendment is not motivated by any true concerns for sovereignty or sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.251" offset="4777935">As such, we urge that this Court find that interlocutory appeals from denials of motions that are based on that amendment should not lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.892" offset="4820566">Secondly, we urge another position on the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.344" offset="4834359">We urge that this Court should take this opportunity to develop a balancing test, a balancing test between two critically important and sometimes conflicting principles of sovereignty on the one hand and the final judgment, and the final judgment requirements of section 1291 on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.857" offset="4928400">In so balancing we believe that any notions of sovereignty pale in the context of the Eleventh Amendment when it is not the state itself, the state qua state, that is seeking to invoke the Eleventh Amendment, but rather, where as here, it is a sewer corporation that has been chartered by an entity that is, has not been determined to be a state for the purpose of the Eleventh Amendment by this very Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.943" offset="5036756">Generally speaking and at a minimum as a matter of law we urge that this Court determine that where sovereignty cannot be found as a matter of law that interlocutory appeals do not lie from the Eleventh Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1311.741" offset="5371959">Nevertheless the language, the historical language of the amendment itself clearly indicates that the framers of that amendment, who knew how to express themselves and what they wanted, did not develop a clear prohibition as they did in the speech and debate clause and in the double jeopardy clause with respect to not having to stand trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.868" offset="5452416">For example, the first iteration of the Eleventh Amendment as enacted in the House of Representatives the day, or introduced in the House of Representatives the day after Chisolm v. Georgia stated that no judicial power shall lie to make a state a defendant in the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.663" offset="5527649">That was then amended shortly thereafter to include the language that we currently have that the jurisdictional power, the judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to suits that are prosecuted or commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.909" offset="5608628">And so what I am suggesting, Justice Souter, is that the framers of the Constitution themselves, understanding the implications of sovereignty and the implications that they had at the time, did not utilize language which clearly precluded the state from being hailed into court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1574.567" offset="6423231">And that, the reason for Hans v. Louisiana and the need to have state sovereignty as the basis for the Eleventh Amendment was because at the time of Hans v.

            <text syncTime="1592.195" offset="6493762">And the states and this Court were concerned that states would have their liability determined not under the substantive law of that own jurisdiction, but rather under Federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1657.183" offset="6753732">Nevertheless, although the language of the amendment itself is clear that the judicial power of the United States shall not extend, clearly this Court has held where states waive their sovereignty they can in a sense create that very judicial power, a ruling or a holding which we believe is inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.163" offset="6825621">In addition this amendment affects the Federal courts and limits the judicial power of the Federal courts, but says nothing whatsoever about Congress which can abrogate the Eleventh Amendment in appropriate circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.971" offset="6876821">Another problem with the current reading of the Eleventh Amendment is that states but not political subdivisions of states such as counties or cities or other local governments are entitled to invoke the Eleventh Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1739.420" offset="7082666">One of the problems with the guidelines in Cohen v. Beneficial Loan is that... first of all there are no problems, and we think that if you apply those standards as enunciated and as stated in Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay several years later that it is easy to say that this particular case does not meet at least two of the three standards of Cohen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.721" offset="7179842">For example, in order to determine that the second test of Cohen has been met it is necessary to determine that this matter presents an issue that is too important to be denied interlocutory review, and the only basis upon which it can be determined that this matter is too important to be denied interlocutory review is if this Court determines that indeed the Eleventh Amendment is based upon precepts of sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.187" offset="7285690">Because if it is not sovereignty but jurisdictional matters themselves which give rise to the Eleventh Amendment, then we are not dealing here with an animal that is too important to be denied review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1882.494" offset="7654957">The first is that the Eleventh Amendment applies only to the protection of the state fisk and therefore the question of sovereignty is clearly raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.164" offset="7689647">On the other hand if the balancing test that we urge upon the Court is something which the Court is inclined to adopt, it need not even reach in this instance the question of sovereignty, because if it is not the state itself, it is not the sovereign itself with which we are dealing, then all of the grand notions and implications of sovereignty which the petitioner has attempted to thrust upon the Court need not be dealt with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.679" offset="7779717">The reason is clear that as the Court looks at this balancing test of the protection of sovereignty on the one hand and the interests of preserving limited Federal jurisdiction as set forth in Congress in section 1291, then as you get further and further away from the state sovereign itself and towards some entity which has been created by it, a creature which has been created by it, you'd need not reach the question of sovereignty at all.</text>

Forsyth, a qualified immunity case involving the attorney general of the United States, and the issues there on qualified immunity had to do with both the attorney general's immunity from suit with respect to actions that he took as a prosecutor and also with respect to actions that the attorney general took in investigatory capacities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.074" offset="8353262">And in that case this Court held that if the ability to claim qualified immunity could not be determined as a matter of law but it was necessary to take factual evidence and to decide on the basis of that factual evidence how the attorney general was acting, that qualified immunity did not lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.951" offset="8428808">Following Mitchell v. Forsyth four or five of the circuit courts that have determined the question about Eleventh Amendment have held that only where immunity, sovereign immunity can be determined as a matter of law, where it is the state itself that can be determined as a matter of law, should Eleventh Amendment immunity lie, and that the protections of Eleventh Amendment should not lie where it is necessary to make factual determinations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2265.212" offset="9185837">Let me point by way of example to two recent decisions of the First Circuit involving the Ports Authority of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.401" offset="9222513">In one of the cases, the H/V Manhattan Prince case, which proceeded to trial, the First Circuit reversed the holding of the trial court and found indeed that in that instance involving pilots and the licensing of pilots for the harbors of San Juan, that the Ports Authority was acting in a state capacity and that therefore it was entitled to claim Eleventh Amendment immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.818" offset="9320211">That was after trial and the development of facts during trial that assisted the entity in proving, so to speak, that it was entitled to Eleventh Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.574" offset="9359290">2 years later, in August of this year, in a case entitled Royal Caribbean v. the Ports Authority, the Eleventh, the First Circuit found that the Eleventh Amendment did not apply to that very same, very same Puerto Rican public corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.434" offset="9418640">And so the question is factually determinative in the sense that you need to determine what it is that the public corporation is engaged in in order to determine whether it is acting as an arm of the state.</text>
