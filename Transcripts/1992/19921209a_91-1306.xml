            <text syncTime="53.468" offset="350775">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="56.836" offset="364254">This case brings before the Court a single question, whether allowing alternate jurors to be present during jury deliberations in violation of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure constitutes automatic reversible error under the plain error rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.999" offset="452966">The background of the case and the pertinent events at trial we think are important and can be very briefly described.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.522" offset="483059">The case arises out of an elaborate financial fraud scheme culminating in a 3-month trial in the Western District of Washington before now Chief Judge Barbara Rothstein.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.496" offset="530916">Toward the conclusion of this trial the district judge suggested to the prosecutor and the defense council that two alternate jurors, who were to be designed as such at the close of trial, be allowed to remain with the jury.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="114.840" offset="596326">Isn't that rather an unusual thing for a judge or a chief judge to do?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="120.409" offset="618582">I don't think so, Justice Blackmun, although we concede, Justice Blackmun, that this was a violation of the Federal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.014" offset="648989">And the reason that I suggest that it's not that unusual, at least where it's consented to, is based upon my understanding that the practice does in fact prevail in certain courts in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.573" offset="703219">It certainly is fairly common in the state court systems, it is not at all unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.513" offset="731013">And in this particular case what Judge Rothstein seemed to be pointing to was the fact that this was an extraordinarily long trial, this had been a very dutiful jury, it had been very attentive, permitted to take notes, and it was obvious to all concerned that this jury was a jury that had focus, not falling asleep at the switch, and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.776" offset="824009">And so--</text>

            <text syncTime="174.292" offset="834145">I was startled when you said this was a fairly normal practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.310" offset="846161">I had a fair amount of trial work when I was in practice and it startled me that a judge did it, because they always excused the alternates in my limited experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.416" offset="878553">Can you, do you have some support for your saying that it's done rather broadly?</text>

            <text syncTime="191.570" offset="903213">If I said... perhaps I should say not uncommon.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="194.772" stopTime="195.005">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_w_starr" startTime="195.005" stopTime="230.492">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="195.005" offset="917005">Yes, Justice Stevens, it is my understanding that judges, for example in the Northern District of Illinois have engaged in this practice and do engage in the practice, and that judges in the Northern District of California engage in the practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.198" offset="977714">Judge Rothstein in her comments said many judges do this where there is consent, and I think that is the key.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.219" offset="1013763">Is there consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.453" offset="1018778">Because under law of the Ninth Circuit if there is a stipulation, then it's all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.640" offset="1039467">No harm, no foul, which is ultimately what I think this case is about.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="236.446" offset="1082726">It should be stopped, and I think the way to do that, Justice Stevens, is through the vehicle, I think the didactic quality of an opinion issuing from this Court will be helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.519" offset="1118984">Obviously people are now focusing on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.637" offset="1127448">Recall in our adversary system the difficulty when at the end of a 3-month trial, and you have tried these kinds of cases, it is extremely difficult, everyone is tired, and the prosecutor said on the record at about this time, I had no sleep last night.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.213" offset="1189828">They are moving along very quickly and no one called 24(c) to the judge's attention, and she was obviously laboring under a misapprehension.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.973" offset="1244790">They could equally have stipulated if some juror gets sick or something we will have an 11-person verdict.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.527" offset="1267046">That's exactly what the rules provide.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="284.360" stopTime="292.514">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="284.360" offset="1274360">So really, if you had a clear rule we shouldn't have this problem in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.912" offset="1292542">And therefore nothing is at stake but this particular trial, is that right?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="292.514" offset="1306961">Oh, I fully disagree with that because if this is plain error, if this is noted as plain error then this Court will have affected a transformation of plain error law.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.453" offset="1350742">May I turn to that?</text>
            <text syncTime="304.738" offset="1355862">What this Court said is that rule 52(b) simply codified existing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.558" offset="1379164">When we look to what existing law was which was being qualified we were talking about the Wiborg case, the earliest case noted by the advisory committee in an opinion of this Court where there was none, zero evidence of guilt on the part of persons who had been convicted along with the ship captain.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.305" offset="1462129">The ship captain was appropriately convicted of this crime, but several crew persons were also convicted, and this Court said no evidence whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.095" offset="1501312">That's why this Court in Frady and in Young has spoken very clearly about egregious errors that would result in a miscarriage of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.933" offset="1540705">Justice Stevens, I think it would be quite a new day and an unfortunate new day if we decided that the plain error rule just means well, it's an obvious error and we're going to send the message to the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.622" offset="1587412">That is not what plain error has been meant to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.574" offset="1599219">That's why we have the Federal judicial center, that's why we have educational programs for judges, that's why we have a responsibility at the Justice Department to educate our prosecutors and to make sure--</text>

            <text syncTime="376.465" offset="1642791">But then the message, the educating message you want to convey is that although it violates the rule and it's plain in that sense, there's no sanction if you do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1448.980" offset="5932829">Now, the Court has or the courts have said that certain plain errors may be noted even though there may have been procedure agreed to, but we do think that this falls into the category, as we argue at some length in our reply brief, into invited error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.525" offset="6007017">But particularly where the judge is saying this is no big deal but I do want you to at least consider this as an accommodation to the jurors, and then no one, of all those defense lawyers, there were two prosecutors but there were a lot of defense lawyers, no one stood up and said 24(c), judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.236" offset="6077861">And Judge Rothstein obviously wasn't focusing on 24(c).</text>

            <text syncTime="1555.015" offset="6356953">Well, 24(c) could not be stated more plainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.451" offset="6370746">An alternate juror who does not replace a regular juror shall be discharged after the jury retires to consider its verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.140" offset="6401466">I do not know what Judge Starr believes would be added to the mix by this Court to announce that that unequivocal rule means precisely what it says in terms of somehow enforcing this particular mandate, because I don't know how this mandate could be stated any more plainly than it is in that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.852" offset="6472310">The question then is does the error in this case justify reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.471" offset="6490805">And in order to determine that you have to look at what the plain error rule requires.</text>

            <text syncTime="1778.784" offset="7252117">With respect to the question of whether the error here is substantial, it seems to me you need go and look no further than to the advisory committee notes which specifically analyzed what the district judge did here in allowing the jurors to go, or excuse me, the alternates to go back into the jury room and expressly condemned that practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.495" offset="7326932">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.995" offset="7328917">Because it intrudes into the sanctity of the deliberations of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.749" offset="7347934">And that's an important value, and this Court has recognized that as an important value in a whole host of cases with very expansive language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.803" offset="7376147">It requires a very significant interest of the state to justify intruding into the jury's deliberations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.957" offset="7400806">And therefore I think it very difficult to say that this is an insubstantial error, and I think particularly since Congress approved this rule against the backdrop of an advisory committee note that regarded this as a very significant matter and specifically rejected this particular approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.632" offset="7467471">It seems to me quite clear that it has to be regarded as a substantial error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.750" offset="7483980">So then the question is should the error have been noticed by the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.404" offset="7506550">And it seems to me in this context there are good reasons for why the court of appeals noticed the particular error here and no good reasons on the other side of the equation with respect to the Government's position as to why you should ignore this particular problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.550" offset="7579170">First, it's important to recognize there is no governmental interest served by this procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.604" offset="7603307">No value is served by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.572" offset="7611249">The problem of a mistrial which might otherwise exist is taken care of completely by rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.709" offset="7635804">The desire to appease or to please the alternate jurors was a consideration both in 1942 and 1983, and was rejected both times by the advisory committee, and that rejection was approved by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.867" offset="7688362">Thus there is no countervailing Government interest that justifies what the district judge did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.254" offset="7709991">Second, what the district judge has done here is to invade a structural element of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.491" offset="7734860">This is not mere trial error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.110" offset="7745413">This is the jury we're talking about and how it deliberates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.645" offset="7759520">This is taking an outside force that has no reason to be there and allowing it to alter the mix within the jury's deliberations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1923.023" offset="7829005">Would you say that was a structural error that was kind of reversible per se?</text>

            <text syncTime="1931.629" offset="7863487">What I would say is that you have to examine all the circumstances of the case in order to determine whether there is reason to believe that it may have made some kind of a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.985" offset="7900894">I mean, one of the considerations in this case is that this is a jury that didn't get it right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.520" offset="7918971">We have 15 counts in which my clients were found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.341" offset="7934331">Five of those counts were dismissed by the court of appeals because there wasn't a shred of evidence in support of those verdicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.010" offset="7969022">In a situation like that I would be far more inclined to find error than I might be in a situation where I was absolutely convinced that the jury had performed its job absolutely perfectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.218" offset="8013848">And so I don't think you can have a per se rule, and we don't urge a per se rule here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.770" offset="8032029">What we say is that if you look at the court of appeals' decision and its decision to notice this particular error, that wasn't an abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.209" offset="8069750">One of the points that Justice Stevens made earlier about how commonplace is this practice, I honestly don't know how commonplace this practice is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.213" offset="8101828">I've never seen it before this particular case, but the judge does say that she knows judges who have undertaken this practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.969" offset="8136832">I think it's important to make two observations about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.337" offset="8150311">First, the ABA's standards on criminal justice categorically state that no jurisdiction follows this procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.757" offset="8176016">It is condemned in all jurisdictions as a matter of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.526" offset="8187092">Nobody has said this is the appropriate way to proceed with regard to jury deliberations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.013" offset="8213005">But the second point about it my assumption is that the judge in this case was probably considering what other judges in the Ninth Circuit do, and if that's the case then it seems to me perfectly legitimate for the Ninth Circuit to have adopted a rule that said this is enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.605" offset="8275386">We don't want this procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.391" offset="8282491">It has no legitimate justification, it creates a great potential for harm, and therefore we want it stopped.</text>

            <text syncTime="2067.743" offset="8407879">And if the district courts have undertaken this practice in the face of a very specific and clear rule, then it seems to me that adding the weight of a court of appeals opinion which requires you to go looking into the digest is not going to advance that cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.020" offset="8469005">If you want to send a message to the district courts you have to send it in one way, and that's by requiring a reversal in a particular instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2510.786" offset="10180130">But the point is... and that's one theory for why you ought to affirm the court of appeals, the one I just identified about the structural nature of the error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.891" offset="10212522">But you can independently affirm the court of appeals because there are lots of good reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.110" offset="10229345">I mean, this was a flawed conviction and therefore there is a very real serious, a very real risk that prejudice arose in this context as a consequence of the violation that was found in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.668" offset="10275634">Just, you know, in addition to that you could conclude that the court of appeals properly tried to stop this practice throughout the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.174" offset="10309593">In addition to that it seems to me you could reasonably conclude that the court of appeals would say that we think that any deliberate, even if in some sense inadvertent but nevertheless clear disregard of a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure, which the judge entertained in this case, does cast out on the public confidence and reputation of the court in a way that this Court has recognized is appropriate in order to find that there has been plain error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.955" offset="10408754">I think my basic point here is that there are substantial grounds that fully support the court of appeals' decision to notice the error here, and either on an independent assessment of that issue or on an abuse of discretion standard I think it would be fair to say this error should have been noticed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.767" offset="10476045">Let me just take a few minutes to discuss what does the Government offer on the other side of the may notice equation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.421" offset="10502586">One, it claims that this was a 3-month trial and begrudges the fact that it would be required to retry these particular defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.343" offset="10542292">That's grossly overstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.478" offset="10550860">Remember, these were seven criminal defendants initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.532" offset="10567056">Five of them have been completely exonerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.266" offset="10578027">Of the 15 counts for the last two, fully one-third of those counts have all been set aside for having no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.905" offset="10604568">The 3-month trial in this case obviously is not attributable just to the claims that are now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.209" offset="10633825">The retrial in this case would be significantly shorter, I submit, than the original one, assuming the Government decides to pursue the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.081" offset="10677293">And it cannot be that simply the cost of having to reprosecute is alone a ground to say that a court of appeals should not notice a plain error affecting substantial rights, otherwise rule 52(b) is rendered a nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.657" offset="10731523">The second argument the Government put forward is its invited error argument, that somehow the defendants here created this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.346" offset="10766318">The record is absolutely clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.780" offset="10772065">This was the judge's idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.382" offset="10778439">She asked for the defendants to go ahead and agree to this, and they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.702" offset="10799755">Whatever else this may be, this was not invited error by the trial lawyers on the defense side in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.290" offset="10826086">And finally, the Government says we can't prove the prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.725" offset="10843849">And I'll have to concede, I can never prove that the invasion of the deliberative process by the, in this case was prejudicial to my client.</text>

            <text syncTime="2690.865" offset="10900378">And don't you have to confront the fact that the degree of plausibility is much lower in this case than it would be, let's say if a bailiff had spent 3 days in the courtroom with them or a witness had spent 3 days in the courtroom with them, and so on?</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.541" offset="10967147">Aren't we entitled and required to take this varying degree of plausibility of prejudice into account?</text>

            <text syncTime="2715.746" offset="10999957">Yes, Justice Souter, I think you can take that into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.932" offset="11012705">I think, however, it probably weighs differently than the way that you characterize it because one of the things that we know is that at least one of these jurors, one of the alternates was absolutely the last person that these defendants wanted in that jury room.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.025" offset="11072996">That was the person they selected, based on the non-verbal behavior of that juror during the trial, that they wanted to be designated as an alternate and therefore not participating in any way in the deliberations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.416" offset="11126599">So it seems to me that I would certainly temper my assessment of the overall likelihood of an affect against the backdrop of knowing that in this case this was the one person we would most have preferred not to be in the case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.675" offset="11179680">And therefore I think the potential for prejudice is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.960" offset="11192741">It is always there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.977" offset="11196816">It has been recognized generically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.244" offset="11201936">I think it also exists with respect to this specific case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.698" offset="11215729">I guess I would end my analysis of this issue and of the appeal by going back to Brasfield v. United States, which I think actually provides an exceptionally good model for exactly what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.041" offset="11277064">You will recall in Brasfield the question was whether or not the judge should poll the jurors as to their division when they were deadlocked, and this Court condemned that practice in language that I think applied, and condemned it categorically and on a plain error basis, it had not been objected to.</text>

            <text syncTime="2848.531" offset="11531079">First, there is no need, as Mr. Phillips suggests, for a court of appeals to reverse a district court in order to send a message.</text>
