            <text syncTime="60.982" offset="370780">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="66.754" offset="393872">This case concerns the implication of a cause of action for contribution in a Federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.698" offset="417592">The statute in question is section 10(b) of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.833" offset="442147">It is a statute in which courts have previously implied a cause of action for people who suffer losses as a result of purchases or sales of securities where the... as a result of damage... or, pardon me, as a result of violations of section 10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="95.835" offset="510170">My theme today is simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.528" offset="520932">The Court should apply its intent-based jurisprudence of implied rights, a standard which respondents concede they cannot meet when asked to apply a cause of action for a contribution in a statute in which a victim's civil claim has previously been implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.938" offset="590627">Respondents and their amici assert that the Court should apply a different line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.192" offset="615600">That is, a line of cases involving fleshing out the victim's remedy itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.578" offset="637125">My burden today is to show that a contribution claim is a separate claim, and it should be treated as any other potential implied right of action in this Court's jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.573" offset="685190">Implied contribution is to be treated like any other request for an implied action, first, because this Court has said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.412" offset="728449">In the Northwest Airlines and Texas Industries cases, the unsuccessful petitioners made arguments which are indistinguishable from the arguments made by the respondents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.211" offset="783724">The Court treated contribution there as an implied claim over those arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.536" offset="809010">In Texas Industries, the petitioner asserted that contribution was not at all a new cause of action, but only a supplement to the victim's express remedy in that statute for damages under section 4 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.134" offset="875361">The respondent... petitioner in that case also argued that contribution was a necessary corollary to judicial creation under the antitrust laws of joint and several liability among violators of that law, and amici in that case actually argued that contribution was somehow within the penumbra of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.331" offset="972223">The court in that case said that in almost any statutory scheme, courts may have to interpret ambiguous or incomplete provisions, but the authority to construe a statute differs fundamentally from the authority to fashion new remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.154" offset="1047456">The court also said that the judicial determination that defendants shall be jointly and severally liable does not suggest that courts have the power to order contribution among the defendants, for joint and several liability only assures that the victims whom Congress intended to protect shall have full recovery from some, if not all, of the perpetrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.700" offset="1157693">Were there any lingering doubt that somehow Texas Industries and Northwest Airlines differed from this Court's general jurisprudence of implied rights of action, I would suggest that was put to rest last year in footnote 6 of Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, where the Court cited all of those cases as a single line and said that it's intent-based jurisprudence shall apply to all such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.682" offset="1273572">Implied contribution is to be treated like any other request for an implied claim, second, because contribution is a distinct action and--</text>

            <text syncTime="300.669" offset="1329474">I suppose that footnote sort of grandfathered the implied cause of action under 10(b).</text>

            <text syncTime="309.595" offset="1365210">--That footnote did not discuss the implied contribution under section 10(b).</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Bird</label>
            <text syncTime="316.561" offset="1393108">The implied cause of action under 10(b) itself was grandfathered as far back as Bankers Life.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.726" offset="1417768">I think the Court has accepted the fact that lower courts have adopted that implied cause of action for victims and repeatedly in a number of cases the Court is fleshed out that cause of remedy, but as... the Court is never addressed the issue whether there shall be implies contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.670" offset="1493523">Contribution is a separate action because it always involves a different plaintiff, and that different plaintiff is someone whose claim has not been recognized that different plaintiff is someone who is always a perpetrator of a violation of the statute, always a member of the class that Congress intended to regulate, never a member of the class that Congress intended to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.459" offset="1620687">Second, contribution very often involves a different defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.135" offset="1647437">Even if contribution is sought in the same action where the victims seek their compensation third party practice permits other parties, other defendants to be brought in by contribution actions, and often, as is the case here, contribution brings to Federal court a new suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.858" offset="1738238">Implying contribution truly extends Federal jurisprudence to embrace a dispute which Congress has not assigned the Federal courts to resolve, and that is a dispute for adjustment of damages among defendants as opposed to a suit for compensation by a victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.922" offset="1822561">Unless Congress tells the Federal courts that it wants them to embrace that dispute, to reach out--</text>

            <text syncTime="490.658" offset="2089533">To illustrate with an example even simpler than Lampf, the court cannot walk away from the question whether the standard for liability under section 10(b) shall be negligence, shall be scienter.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.788" offset="2145957">The court cannot say, well, Congress didn't instruct us on this so we simply won't answer the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1212.625" offset="4977317">The secondary jurisprudence in this case already includes what's the effect of partial settlement without guidance of Congress, whether contribution, if allowed, would be pro rata or by relative fault, some guidance by Congress in section 11 of the 1933 act, none any place else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.719" offset="5057774">In this very case, if one were to look to sections 9 and 18 and say well, Congress might have done the same thing, in any case where there is both a section 10 claim and a 1933 section 11 claim, it's possible for the section 10 contribution analysis utterly to overwhelm the plain language of section 11, which says that those who were intentional wrongdoers shall not have contribution against those whose violation was recklessness or of some lesser character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.101" offset="5203224">And I think, Justice Stevens, although in general one would look at 1934, it is certainly valid in this case to say, once one gets into the analysis of contribution, should we look at section 20A and see if in section 20A, which Congress passed in 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.528" offset="5292981">it had learned something about whether contribution was efficacious or not, and explicitly declined to adopt it as part of the Insider Trading Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1696.124" offset="6911319">The Court looks to the 73rd Congress, the interrelated '33 act and '34 act, to the express statutory remedies that are the analogues of section 10(b), and then decides what Congress would have intended had it considered the issue, and what result would conform the 10(b) implied remedy most faithfully to the statutory regime.</text>

            <text syncTime="1851.931" offset="7534601">What the Court was doing in those two cases, we respectfully submit, and the Court did unanimously, was look to the intention of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.028" offset="7566992">In each of those cases, Congress had created an explicit statutory remedy, and in each of those cases Congress had not included a cause of action or a claim or a remedy for contribution as a part of the explicit cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.321" offset="7632090">As a result, the Court determined Congress created this cause of action explicitly, did not want contribution as a part of it, and we will adhere to the judgment of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.908" offset="7674512">The phrase, cause of action, really had very little to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.401" offset="7688410">What we submit is what is happening in the Securities Act... and by the way, in the Northwest Airlines case the court said specifically when... in a footnote, the Court specifically said, when Congress did want to create a cause of action or a remedy or a right for contribution, it did so, and the Court in that footnote pointed explicitly to the securities laws, the '33 and '34 acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.288" offset="7791959">Those... the rule of contribution explicitly provided in the Securities Acts is very unusual in Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.813" offset="7826127">There are very few explicit rights to contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.465" offset="7840756">Thus, Congress knew what it was doing when it included a rights... rights to contribution in the Securities Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.481" offset="7872730">In fact, in section 11 and in section 9 and in section 18, the reference to contribution is included in the definition of the right or the remedy itself, thus suggesting that Congress felt that contribution was a part of the cause of action or a part of the remedy, and suggesting that Congress felt that that contribution right was an important essential feature of the remedy itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.119" offset="7983280">Thus, we don't believe that contribution is a separate cause of action, but even if it were a separate cause of action, the very same methodology would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.936" offset="8026643">The Court would try to determine whether implying the cause of action, if that's what's going to be done, would be most consistent with the statutory framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.002" offset="8062901">We submit that, again, it would be most consistent with the statutory framework, because every time the... when Congress did create a mechanism for securities fraud in 1933 and 1934, it repeatedly put contribution as a part of those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.286" offset="8147956">This Court has determined over and over again that the provisions to which I've referred are most like section 10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.081" offset="8175123">Section 10(b) is a part of them, it's a judicial overlay to section 10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.676" offset="8201559">In the same rules Congress would have wanted to include a right of contribution in a 10(b) remedy just as it did... it wanted to include a right of contribution with respect to the sections 11, 9, and 18 remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.765" offset="8257879">Probably most telling is the consequences of what might occur if the Court were to hold a noncontribution right in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.354" offset="8308243">Because section 10(b) is an overlay to these explicit Securities Act provisions, the parade of horribles that the plaintiffs refer to about... that result allegedly from contribution are going to exist anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.177" offset="8391521">Petitioner's concern about the complexity in settlements and so forth we submit is going to occur anyway because contribution does exist, it will exist, and it will continue to exist in section 10b-5 cases because sections 9, 11, and 18 are also going to be involved in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.460" offset="8464664">In fact, what would happen if this Court adopted a no-contribution rule in section 10(b) cases, it would give the plaintiffs a choice to write out of existence the contribution rights that Congress so explicitly intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.679" offset="8529552">In 10(b) cases or in securities fraud cases, you'd have a choice of the plaintiff to select contribution or no contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.977" offset="8562780">Because section 10(b) overrides everything else, if the plaintiffs chose to select 10(b), it could write out the provisions of contribution that exist in sections 9, 11, and 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.436" offset="8612622">Thus, you would involve... as a result of the judicial creation of section 10(b), involve yourself in a judicial implied repeal of the contribution rights that Congress so explicitly intended.</text>

            <text syncTime="2209.708" offset="8965693">In addition to that, as this Court indicated in Bateman Eichler, there's affirmative value in the enforcement process to allow the wrongdoers to sue one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.884" offset="9006339">It allows them, the defendants, to bring cases against other potential defendants to bring to the attention of the law enforcement authorities possible violations of the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.902" offset="9046463">That's why the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission has filed a brief and is here today supporting the inclusion of contribution, because contribution is such a necessary... as perceived by Congress, inclusion in the Securities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.832" offset="9106127">If you give plaintiffs an opportunity to repeal contribution, and plaintiffs may well choose to decide not to plead violations of the statute that do involve contribution because they may decide that may give them some leverage against some of the defendants, or they may decide to dismiss some of the cases if they can make a deal with some of the defendants because of joint and several liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.897" offset="9206437">That would allow section 10(b), the nocontribution rule of section 10(b) to be used as a judicial implied repeal of the contribution rights in the other sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.225" offset="9255757">Furthermore, a decision against contribution would, as Justice Stevens suggested in his questions a moment ago, overturn 25 years of consistent lower court case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.702" offset="9301628">Until a few months ago, when the Eighth Circuit decided the Chutich case, there was 25 years of consistent law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.759" offset="9333915">Now, earlier, we... there was some debate by Mr. Bird as to the size of the judicial oak.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.164" offset="9359515">It's interesting, and I think quite compelling, that when section 10(b) got to this Court for the first time in 1971, it was 25 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.343" offset="9404237">It had first been recognized 25 years before in the Kardon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.757" offset="9425866">In the Blue Chip case, when this case first reached the Birnbaum rule, that rule, which came from the Second Circuit, was 22 years old, and the Blue Chip case, in the words of the Chief Justice speaking... Justice... then Justice Rehnquist, speaking for the Court, was that the 25 years of consistent judicial interpretation should not... was significantly persuasive in and of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.583" offset="9537148">Today, we are facing the decision with respect to contribution or no contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.167" offset="9559508">Contribution has been around in the Federal courts in the securities fraud area for 25 years, the same length of time, and with about the same judicial pedigree... Mr. Bird said contribution hadn't been approved by as many courts as section 10(b) at the time section 10(b) got here, but there are seven... five or six circuits that have approved contribution, and I suspect the weight of judicial authority is about the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.616" offset="9665357">The same is true of the Birnbaum rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.405" offset="9672462">So the contribution rule comes to this Court with the same weight of judicial authority behind it from the lower courts as did the 10(b) rule itself and the purchaser-seller rule found by the Court to continue to be appropriate in the Blue Chip case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.220" offset="9755740">In summary, the choice is an outcome consistent with congressional intent as expressed in section 10(b)'s closest analogues, with 25 years of judicial interpretation, the SEC's view of the enforcement scheme and how it can best be administered, and the framer's decision as to where policy decisions should be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.675" offset="9857513">The alternative cannot possibly be said to be consistent with congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.469" offset="9880710">In fact, it would repeal congressional decisions, and it would fail to fulfill this Court's duty to complete the task it undertook beginning in 1971 to make the section 10(b) remedy as close as possible to the instrument Congress would have created and as compatible as possible with the regulatory and enforcement regime Congress did create.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.356" offset="9980289">To summarize, we are only asking this Court to do what the Court has consistently done with section 10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.191" offset="10011636">Having created the judicial remedy, what are its configurations and contours going to be, and how can we best make it more closely approximate what Congress would have intended and how may we make it the closest possible approximation to what will not interfere with the enforcement provisions of the remaining provisions of the Securities Act and how best to fulfill the purposes of those acts?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2508.376" offset="10160325">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.204" offset="10207659">The Securities and Exchange Commission has concluded that the Court should recognize a right of contribution under section 10(b) and rule 10b-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.012" offset="10250917">The Commission has made that conclusion for essentially two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.784" offset="10269934">First, Congress provided for contribution in provisions of the 1934 act that create express private rights of action for securities fraud, that is, sections 9 and 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.774" offset="10321970">Because section 10(b) is part of a family of rights that should be construed as a coherent whole, Congress' decision to recognize a right to contribution in the comparable express causes of action should govern in actions under section 10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.826" offset="10394173">Second, the Court has the power to recognize a right of contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.089" offset="10415175">The section 10(b) right of action is an implied right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.122" offset="10431371">Defendants are liable under section 10(b) only because courts have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.006" offset="10454881">In prior cases, this Court has defined the contours of the section 10(b) right of action to maintain evenhanded administration of the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.262" offset="10495946">The Court can and should exercise that power in this case to recognize a right to contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.049" offset="10527084">Now, let me address the second point, the power point, first.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="2604.049" offset="10543071">Mr. Long, do you think in recent cases we've said that the courts have the power to create causes of action?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2613.836" offset="10582150">Well, I think what we have here is, we would agree this is a cause of action, but it's not an independent cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.343" offset="10620184">Contribution is entirely derivative of the underlying section 10(b) cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.349" offset="10644217">The parties are all parties who either were present in the original action or they could have been present if the plaintiff had named them, and the liability is the liability that's established in the original action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.168" offset="10687476">So we do not view this as a case in which it's appropriate to apply the Texas Industries or Northwest Airlines type of analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.175" offset="10723525">That analysis is appropriate where Congress has expressly created a cause of action but has omitted a right of contribution.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="2659.001" offset="10762813">Well, you might think that if Congress has expressly created the cause of action and we lack the power to create a right of contribution that a fortiori there wouldn't be such a right if it's only an implied cause of action in the first place.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2678.263" offset="10839926">Well, again, the approach the Court has followed is when it has implied the cause of action it has undertaken the necessary process of defining the contours of that action of rounding it out, and where the question is whether there should be a right of contribution, we see no essential difference between answering that question and answering the kinds of questions that this Court has answered in many prior cases under section 10(b), whether to recognize a defense, the measure of damages... this is really, we think, just another question in that line.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="2713.957" offset="10982659">Well, to the extent that it is a new cause of action, it seems to me it's a step beyond questions about whether there should be a statute of limitations or a defense.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_a_long_jr" startTime="2725.347" stopTime="2776.171">
            <label>Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2725.347" offset="11028217">I would agree with you that it's a step beyond in that sense, but again, I would emphasize this is quite different from implying a freestanding cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.271" offset="11067923">And in the situation the Court is presented with here, when section 10(b) really sits among some express causes of action that Congress created, where Congress expressly recognized rights of contribution and section 10(b) not only sits in the middle of those but in fact is a kind of catch-all that overlaps to a great degree, for the Court to not imply, or not recognize a right of contribution we think would in fact be less respectful to the intent of Congress than to apply the same policy choice, the same weighing of policy considerations that Congress made in 1934.</text>

            <text syncTime="2776.171" offset="11231554">I wonder what underlies that policy choice in these other sections, or under 10b-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.313" offset="11260080">Why is the Commission so intent on furnishing retribution in 10(b) cases... or, retribution?</text>

            <text syncTime="2797.955" offset="11318699">The Commission reached this conclusion because it decided as a matter of fairness and as a matter of evenhanded administration of the securities laws that a contribution right ought to be recognized under section 10(b).</text>

            <text syncTime="2814.047" offset="11383064">Well, how does that work out?</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.008" offset="11386930">You mean these people who are jointly and severally liable, if somebody gets stuck for the whole bill it's fairer to dig out the other fellows who should share the liability, is that it?</text>

            <text syncTime="2831.309" offset="11452132">That's part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.200" offset="11455685">It is... under section 10(b), a very wide variety of defendants may be sued, and there may be quite a range of responsibility, and it is possible for a defendant with a deep pocket but with rather less serious culpability to be stuck, as you say, for the entire liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.385" offset="11536351">That's part of the fairness argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.286" offset="11543979">As I say, the other part is a desire to harmonize the securities laws and give these defendants the right to contribution that Congress gave them in the comparable express causes of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2931.799" offset="11854000">The absence of contribution I think gives plaintiffs additional control over the lawsuit, I think is the short answer to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.816" offset="11890153">Let me say, then, just a word about the second point I have, why the Commission believes that the comparable provisions in the securities laws evince a congressional intent to allow contribution in private actions for damages for securities fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.789" offset="11973954">In Lampf, the Court identified the express rights of action that are most analogous to the implied right of action under section 10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.933" offset="12010630">They are found in sections 9 and 18 of the 1934 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.189" offset="12031632">Sections 9 and 18 target the precise dangers that are the focus of section 10(b), and they provide remedies for investors injured by manipulative practices or false or misleading statements, and of course both sections 9 and 18 expressly provide for contributions... contribution rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.432" offset="12112612">Section 10(b) is the catch-all provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.903" offset="12122434">It overlaps both sections 9 and 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.095" offset="12135182">It provides a general remedy for manipulative or deceptive practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.796" offset="12153990">Because sections 9, 10(b), and 18 are integral elements of a complex web of regulations, as the Court said in Lampf, they should be construed to form a coherent whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.416" offset="12204563">Consequently, Congress' express determination to allow contribution under sections 9 and 18 should also govern under section 10(b).</text>

            <text syncTime="3074.832" offset="12426186">and followed with citation to the three cases which then said there would be contribution in 10b-5 actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.207" offset="12455652">If contribution in 10b-5 actions is a sapling, it was never cultivated by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.212" offset="12487730">Complexity of contribution is an issue of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.665" offset="12509464">Fleshing out a new cause of action for contribution is an Article 1, Article 3 problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="3105.272" offset="12547917">Finally, this case is at the intersection of two lines of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.666" offset="12577487">One line of authority says that as to all causes of action there shall be implication if, in a Federal statute, if, and only if, Congress clearly and affirmatively intended that that be so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.327" offset="12648122">Another line of cases says, we have this 10b-5 victim's cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.483" offset="12676752">We must flesh it out, and because we have no other signpost, we must look to what Congress would have done if Congress had realized there was going to be this cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.033" offset="12734953">The question is which of those lines of authority shall govern the cause of action, if any, for contribution under section 10b-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.978" offset="12778734">The would-have-done analysis is exactly what got this Court to the Borak cause of action, and it is exactly what this Court rejected in Touche Ross, in Transamerica Mortgage Advisers, in Texas Industries, and in Northwest Airlines, and it is exactly what this Court should reject here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.626" offset="12877373">From this intersection, the Court should say the intent-based jurisprudence implies... applies to all implied causes of action, whether for contribution or for anything else.</text>
