            <text syncTime="12.218" offset="183954">Ms. Hedlund, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Ms. Carel T. Hedlund</label>
            <text syncTime="21.825" offset="222406">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="25.178" offset="235781">This case involves the reasonable cost methodology under the Medicare program.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.932" offset="254798">Under that provision, the Secretary is to reimburse providers for their reasonable cost of providing services to Medicare beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.158" offset="287712">The statute defines "reasonable costs" as those costs actually incurred, excluding therefrom any part of incurred costs found to be unnecessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.939" offset="342883">The statute requires the Secretary to do two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.495" offset="365035">The first is, it authorizes the Secretary to use a variety of methods to determine a provider's reasonable costs in the first instance, and then in clause 2 of the same section, it requires the Secretary to make suitable retroactive, corrective adjustments for individual providers when the methods produce inaccurate results.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.119" offset="463568">The issue in this case is what kind of individual retroactive corrective adjustments does clause 2 require?</text>
            <text syncTime="89.845" offset="494497">Are they adjustments to bring an individual provider's reimbursement into line with reasonable cost as it's defined in the statute... that is, actual costs excluding those due to unnecessary services or to inefficiency?</text>
            <text syncTime="107.616" offset="565550">That is the position the hospital contends that clause 2 requires... or is it simply an adjustment to reconcile the interim payments the provider receives during the year with the amount that the methods say that you get, with the Secretary's regulatory method?</text>
            <text syncTime="125.048" offset="635245">In this case, the petitioners are six rural Nebraska hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.502" offset="657084">Prior to the cost years under appeal, their costs were always under the Medicare cost limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.446" offset="676937">Beginning with the years under appeal, however, their costs exceeded the Medicare cost limits for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.770" offset="706194">The hospitals still had the same necessary costs that they had in prior years.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.935" offset="726883">The record shows there were no findings that the hospitals operated inefficiently.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.127" offset="747572">The Secretary admitted in his answer to the complaint that the cost limits for areas that have a high percentage of part-time employment is artificially low, it is set artificially low, and yet the cost limits were applied in this case to disallow a substantial portion of the hospitals' necessary operating costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.611" offset="829596">The Secretary applies the Medicare cost limits in a conclusive fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.605" offset="853524">That means a provider cannot be reimbursed for costs in excess of the cost limits even if the provider can demonstrate that the costs are reasonable and necessary unless the provider's costs fall within one of a very few narrow exceptions that the Secretary has provided for, and in this case both parties agree there were no regulatory exceptions applicable to these providers.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.812" offset="958328">In this Court, we are not challenging the validity of the routine cost-limit methodology as a general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.469" offset="996989">We are saying that for these particular providers the reimbursement produced by the Secretary's methods was inadequate under the statutory standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.358" offset="1040561">That is, it failed to reimburse the provider's actual, necessary costs, excluding those costs due to inefficiency or unnecessary services, and what the hospitals are seeking is the opportunity to show that their costs in excess limits of the cost limits were reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="250.413" offset="1136796">The words of Clause (ii) are obviously central to this case, and they say that the Secretary shall provide for the making of a suitable retroactive corrective adjustment where for a provider of services for any fiscal period the aggregate reimbursement produced by the methods of determining costs proves to be inadequate or excessive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1322.107" offset="5423490">Petitioners in this case were subject to exactly the same regulatory cost limits that applied to all similar Medicare providers during the years at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.470" offset="5461002">Their costs exceeded those limits, and they concede that they did not qualify for any of the exemptions or exceptions provided in the Secretary's regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.269" offset="5504156">In the courts below, petitioners challenged the validity of the regulatory cost limits, saying that they were arbitrary and irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.066" offset="5543340">They lost that challenge, and in this Court they concede that the regulatory cost limits are generally valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.032" offset="5571239">Nevertheless, they assert a right to some sort of individualized proceeding in which to seek exactly the same relief on the ground that those limits, although generally valid, should not apply to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1597.868" offset="6526589">If there's a key point in this case, it is that when the Secretary prescribes a valid cost limit, which is to be recognized as reasonable, that, as a matter of statutory authority, pretermits any further inquiry into whether a the valid application of those methods produces a result which is reasonable or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.434" offset="6616868">Well, I... the concern, though, is that here the statute spells out how the Secretary is going to determine the calculation of reasonable costs, but then subsection (ii), the clause on which petitioners rely, says that where the aggregate reimbursement made by these methods of determining reasonable cost proves to be either inadequate or excessive, that some adjustment will be made, and that suggests at least that it's more than just going through the reasonable cost analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1677.123" offset="6843611">We would submit that the language, "inadequate or excessive" at the end of the statute begs the immediate question, inadequate or excessive compared to what?</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.376" offset="6872659">Now, compared to what has to be reasonable cost, as defined in the statute, but reasonable cost is not self-defining in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1706.621" offset="6961580">I mean, there's another statute, I think--</text>

            <text syncTime="1710.655" offset="6977776">1395g, that says you're going to do the book-balancing, so I think probably it's reasonable to read subsection (ii) as requiring something more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.233" offset="7032006">I get bogged down in what the something more might be and how the Secretary could do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.527" offset="7057188">I mean, maybe the Secretary can do the something more in the very way the Secretary has, by providing exceptions here and there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1742.335" offset="7104417">Well, I certainly agree that if Clause (ii) requires anything more than we say it does, which is to say, year-end reconciliation, then whatever obligation it imposes on the Secretary is first of all qualified by the words "suitable retroactive corrective adjustments" which implies a certain range of discretion, and second is fully accounted for by the exceptions and exemptions that the Secretary has in fact built into the cost limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.116" offset="7211519">Now, I should be clear that we do not think those exemptions or exceptions were promulgated under the authority of Clause (ii) because we don't think that is what Clause (ii) is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.461" offset="7244956">Now, with respect to section 1395g, with respect I think the two statutory provisions really look at different phases of the process in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.826" offset="7286439">First of all, section 1395g is a payment mechanism, and if you look at the beginning of section 1395g, which I believe is quoted on page 20 of petitioners' brief in note 17, the beginning of that section is,</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.728" offset="7358014">"The Secretary shall periodically determine the amount which should be paid under part A to each provider of services. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.483" offset="7385077">and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.452" offset="7388943">Now that refers to something obviously as outside of section 1395g itself as to the substantive determination of how much is to be paid, and we submit that what it refers to is the Secretary's cost determination methods which are in fact specified in section 1395x(v).</text>

            <text syncTime="1914.920" offset="7794781">Now, Your Honor does raise an interesting point, however, which is that in the context of this particular clause, what's sauce for the goose has to be sauce for the gander, so that if in fact Clause 2 provides for some kind of retroactive change in the methods which are applied, then there's no reason why the Secretary couldn't come in and say... because as Justice Scalia said, there's a variety of reasonable methods that could be applied to determining costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.797" offset="7894256">There's no reason the Secretary couldn't come xx at some point and say well, you know, I know I promulgate these regulations that said that X was reasonable, but now I really think that it should have been X minus 10 and I'm going to apply that on a case-by-case adjudication to every provider in the Medicare program with an open year, and provided that those... both X and X minus 10 are reasonable within some broad unstructured definition, I assume the Secretary gets away with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2608.229" offset="10568045">To return for a moment to Mr. Justice Souter's question, I think it's important to realize that there is a tautology involved, we think, in Clause (ii), which is to say that the costs you're going to compare have to be costs that are determined by the Secretary's methods, and you're going to compare them to some standard of reasonableness, but as we also say, the standard of reasonableness is the standard that is produced by the Secretary's methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.396" offset="10672639">Now, our interpretation accommodates that tautology, because we're not talking about changing the methods, we are only talking about changing the data, because the data when you originally make payments are estimated and provisional, and the data when you eventually make final settlement are audited and correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.609" offset="10745573">Now, petitioners' interpretation, on the other hand, really destroys that tautology because they have to be in a position of saying, well, what you compare this to is some general and rather amorphous statutory standard of reasonableness, which first of all we think is inconsistent with the statutory language--</text>
