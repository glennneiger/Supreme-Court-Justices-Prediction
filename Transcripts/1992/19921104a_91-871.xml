            <label>Mr. Kevin M. Gillis</label>
            <text syncTime="63.334" offset="389722">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="105.613" offset="558891">This case involves the question of interpretation of the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act as amended in 1984, as it applies to claims by retired workers for occupational hearing loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.219" offset="605285">The facts are quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.436" offset="614166">Mr. Brown, the plaintiff, worked for the employer, Bath Iron Works, in Bath, Maine, from 1939 until his retirement in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.401" offset="650006">In 1985, 13 years after his retirement, he filed a claim for occupational hearing loss under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.226" offset="681249">That claim was based upon an audiogram taken in 1983, which showed an 84 percent hearing loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.708" offset="711237">That award was made under section 908(c)(13) by the administrative law judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.956" offset="736210">The issue as presented is whether certain amendments to the act in 1984 applying to occupational disease claims by retirees should have been applied to determine this worker's claim, or this worker's benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.293" offset="793575">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit below held that the occupational disease amendments in 1984 were not applicable to hearing loss claims and would not affect this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.023" offset="836521">Previously, the administrative law judge on the Benefits Review Board of the Department of Labor had held in this case that the occupational disease law amendments would apply for the limited purpose of determining the average weekly wage for the purpose of calculating benefits, but that they were otherwise not applicable to hearing loss claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.547" offset="914575">In other cases, the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits have held that the occupational disease amendments in 1984 do apply to hearing loss claims and subsequently the Department's Benefits Review Board earlier this year reversed itself and has agreed with the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.493" offset="986359">Our position is that the amendments do apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.585" offset="998689">In order to analyze the problem, it is necessary to review the statute as it existed prior to 1984 and the case law under the pre-'84 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.050" offset="1044560">Prior to the amendments, the statute provided for two basic types of disability benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.640" offset="1070996">The one would be a nonscheduled award, or an award for economic disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.122" offset="1088863">That comes into play when the worker is disabled by injury or disease from performing his regular work.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.166" offset="1121046">He could have received benefits for total or partial benefits which could be temporary or permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.023" offset="1144452">The second basic type of award is a so-called scheduled award, found in sections 908(c)(1) through (20).</text>
            <text syncTime="259.709" offset="1175172">That award compensates the worker for specific losses of bodily parts or bodily functions or percentages of loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.908" offset="1212057">Among the types of scheduled award is a hearing loss under section 908(c)(13).</text>
            <text syncTime="275.125" offset="1236926">Early in 1984, the Benefits Review Board issued two decisions having to do with retirees claiming occupational diseases.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.805" offset="1283632">The first was Aduddell v. Owens-Corning.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.898" offset="1295962">In that case, the worker had developed asbestos-related disease but had retired before the disease became manifest.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.974" offset="1328250">It was ruled that the worker was not entitled to a nonscheduled disability benefit because of his status as a retiree, the reasoning being that because he had retired he was out of the labor force and it was inappropriate to provide him with a disability benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.733" offset="1395332">Less than a month later, the board decided Redick v. Bethlehem Steel, which was a claim by a retired worker for benefits under section 908(c)(13), a scheduled award for hearing loss, and following Aduddell, the board held that the worker was not entitled to the award because of his status as a retiree at the time the hearing loss became manifest.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.738" offset="1487388">Against this background, Congress amended the statute in 1984 in part dealing with the problem of occupational disease claims by retirees, and our position is that those amendments were intended to apply to hearing loss claims just as to other occupational disease claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.558" offset="1570666">A starting point for analyzing the statute... that is, the amendments... is section 910(i), which I'll refer shorthand as section 10(i).</text>
            <text syncTime="368.163" offset="1609014">That section provides essentially that in occupational disease claims the time of injury for the purpose of determining the average weekly wage is the time when the occupational disease becomes manifest to the worker, when he becomes aware of it, or should have become aware of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.142" offset="1668991">That is the disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.016" offset="1676410">That is, when the worker becomes aware of the disability.</text>

            <text syncTime="402.963" offset="1748194">The hearing loss of 84 percent didn't occur until 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.710" offset="1771182">We have no way of knowing whether it occurred... whether it was present at the time he retired, and that's because of the effect of aging, so that the disability that became manifest to the worker in 1983 and for which he was entitled to claim in all likelihood didn't occur at the time he retired.</text>

            <text syncTime="1689.615" offset="6894839">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the members of the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.987" offset="6920335">Unlike Mr. Gillis, who represents Bath Iron Works, and Mr. White who represents the Director, Department of the... a portion of the Department of Labor, I represent a single individual, Mr. Ernest Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.263" offset="6973415">My main point in being here today is to argue that Mr. Brown should be allowed to keep his award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.058" offset="7004658">It is my understanding that the Director concedes that he should be allowed to keep the award which was given to him by the administrative law judge many years ago, subsequently affirmed by the Benefits Review Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.943" offset="7056171">The court below, the First Circuit, found on the final page of its opinion that the issue of whether or not Mr. Brown's benefit should be recalculated has been waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.687" offset="7111133">So my initial point would be that the matter of the amount to which Mr. Brown is entitled has been finally determined... it is not questioned before this Court... so that in the event the Court adopts the position of the First Circuit, or adopts the position which was formally held by the Benefits Review Board, Mr. Brown is allowed to keep the benefits which he has already been awarded.</text>

            <text syncTime="1850.940" offset="7540168">If the Court accepts the position which was formerly held by the Benefits Review Board, it will effectively reduce the amount of compensation to which he's entitled by about one third, so we certainly have a case of controversy if the Court decides that these benefits should be recalculated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.997" offset="7608400">On the issue of which particular system Congress intended to use in this matter, let me first address the position taken by the Director.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.742" offset="7651345">The Director says that the retiree amendments which Congress enacted in 1984 simply do not apply, and we get back again, as the Court did earlier in Mr. Gillis' argument to section 10(i).</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.736" offset="7715293">10(i) applies only if the disease does not immediately result in disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.561" offset="7738594">The Director argues that because there is an immediate injury, that is, when the worker is exposed to noise he has an immediate injury, section 10(i) does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.915" offset="7788018">If the Court reviews the definition of disability which is contained in the statute... and remember, 10(i) only applies if the disability does not immediately occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.269" offset="7837441">The definition of disability states that there must be a loss of wage-earning capacity.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald W. Lupton</label>
            <text syncTime="1936.812" offset="7883626">That's correct, Your Honor, but for the purposes of section 10(i), which doesn't refer to scheduled awards, it simply says in the case of an injury which does not immediately result in disability, then you have to go and read the section which defines disability, section 210.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.289" offset="7949559">Disability is defined as a loss of wage-earning capacity, or, for retirees, as a permanent impairment assessed under the guides of the American Medical Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.879" offset="7999923">Under no theory, or under no facts in this case, did Mr. Brown's hearing loss immediately result in a disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.327" offset="8041719">First, he continued to work throughout his entire working life and retired in 1972, voluntarily for reasons totally unrelated to his hearing loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.633" offset="8094904">He had no disability in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.993" offset="8104308">Secondly, the treatises cited by the Director show that hearing loss progresses over time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.192" offset="8141193">There is an initial injury which continually gets worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.675" offset="8159061">It doesn't simply happen, as if someone put a gun next to your ear and pulled the trigger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.953" offset="8184243">This type of occupational noise-induced hearing loss as a medical proposition takes place over time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.013" offset="8212455">The record reflects, in fact, that Mr. Brown had a 40 percent hearing loss in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.963" offset="8244220">There is no evidence in the record that that 40 percent hearing loss caused any impairment to his wage-earning capacity, and in fact, as I mentioned earlier, he continued to work for 18 more years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.380" offset="8293957">Under the Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, published by the American Medical Association, hearing loss again... occupational noise-induced hearing loss... does not immediately result in a disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.655" offset="8354979">The Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment say that you do not have an injury, a permanent impairment, until the hearing loss has progressed in the critical frequencies to a point where you have lost an average of 25 decibels of your hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.786" offset="8439512">So under no... not under the facts of this case, nor under the medical opinions, nor under the phrasing of the statute, did Mr. Brown's hearing loss immediately result in an injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.891" offset="8499907">The case does fall within section 10(i).</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.530" offset="8518506">The question then is, having once fallen within section 10(i), you then fall within what had been characterized as the retiree amendments in section 10(d)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.321" offset="8573677">Those amendments talk about whether... at what point, rather, the hearing loss or the disability manifests itself?</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.801" offset="8615577">Does it manifest itself within 1 year of retirement or after 1 year of retirement?</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.299" offset="8637624">Section 10 is nothing other than Congress' direction as to which wage is to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.172" offset="8669076">Once all the other decisions in the case have been made, the court or the administrative body has to look at whether or not notice was filed in time, whether or not the claim was formally filed in time, whether or not the individual has, in this case a disability caused by noise, and then, after making all those findings, it simply goes to section 10 and says, what do we pay this individual?</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.504" offset="8770431">What date do we use to calculate his average weekly wage?</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.581" offset="8782761">That's all section 10 is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.956" offset="8788194">I would advocate in this particular case that the Court adopt a position which was utilized by Justice O'Connor in Perini North River.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.779" offset="8831453">In that particular case, the Court looked at the statute prior to, there, the 1972 amendments, to see if an individual was covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.901" offset="8871995">It reviewed the 1972 amendments and made a decision that the individual in that case would have been covered prior to the 1972 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.272" offset="8909507">Justice O'Connor then analyzed the legislative history in the wording of the statute and made a determination that Congress meant to expand coverage under the 1972 amendments and included that claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.876" offset="8963841">Justice Stevens dissented in that case saying simply, if you read the statute... which is essentially what the employer in this case says... if you read the statute, you are forced to come to the position advocated by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.715" offset="9011280">Justice Stevens took that position in dissenting in Perini and said, if you read the statute as claimed, this man is not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.414" offset="9038029">However, in that case, the Court did review the law prior to the '72 amendments, reviewed the legislative history, and went on to decide the individual was covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.613" offset="9082855">If you take the same approach in this case, you will see that Mr. Brown could have been compensated prior to the 1984 amendments for his hearing loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.217" offset="9137295">There was no need for the so-called retiree amendments which we're talking about in this case to have been enacted in order for him to have been compensated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.542" offset="9178568">You will also see that hearing loss cases had historically been treated differently from other occupational disease cases under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.460" offset="9218274">Hearing loss cases are the only scheduled occupational disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.707" offset="9243247">Mr. Gillis and the Court was discussing Redick earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.126" offset="9256935">In that case, the Court decided, since Mr. Redick filed his claim following retirement, at which point he was not working and therefore suffered no wage loss, he could not then be compensated because he had no wage loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.840" offset="9323704">He had no loss of earning capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.948" offset="9328197">The retiree amendments were enacted to deal with that sort of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.321" offset="9357663">Mr. Brown could have been compensated prior to those amendments because case law established that the date of manifestation was his date of injury for the purposes of filing notice, for the purposes of filing his claim, and for the purpose of determining his average weekly wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.842" offset="9447734">It also established in Mr. Justice Stevens' opinion in Potomac Electric, written in 1980, that hearing loss is a scheduled award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.478" offset="9494336">Congress has presumed that the individual has a loss of wage-earning capacity simply if the injury is a hearing loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.208" offset="9541252">If you look at that decision and then look at Redick, you can see that Redick is plainly wrong because the Benefits Review Board, completely ignoring Potomac Electric, said we can't compensate this gentleman because he has no loss of wage-earning capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.124" offset="9604886">They simply didn't review the law and see that was not part of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.262" offset="9625471">Because hearing loss claims have always been the only statute under the schedule, there is a presumed loss of earning capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.259" offset="9653474">A review of the 1984 amendments, which consumed 4 years' worth of hearings, a review of the House amendments and the House proposals, and the review of the conference committee to see what ultimately came out, will show that hearing loss cases have been treated differently than other occupational disease cases, that Congress had no need to be concerned with hearing loss cases specifically because they could have been compensated without the '84 amendments, that Congress was really working on compensating individuals who suffer from other types of long latency occupational diseases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.163" offset="9829017">I agree for the most part with the position taken by the director.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.334" offset="9841765">The key difference is, I advocate the hybrid system which was until very recently utilized by the Benefits Review Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="2748.907" offset="11132005">In his opinion for the First Circuit, Chief Judge Briar put his finger on the key statutory provision and the key fact in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2808.462" offset="11370241">The way occupational hearing loss occurs is that the sound waves generated by a loud noise batter the nerve endings in the inner ear and immediately cause them to become inflamed, which leads to an immediate loss of hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2962.696" offset="11987149">So the key provision in section 10(i), the key fact in this case, is that occupational hearing loss does not have a latency period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.708" offset="12031244">To the contrary, as should be clear by now, occupational hearing loss occurs simultaneously with exposure to excessive noise, and it does not get worse after the noise goes away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.483" offset="12090281">Bath Iron Works concedes that this is so, said so here today, at page 8 of its brief it states, quote, it is true that occupational loss of hearing is immediate because it does not progress following exposure to noise, unquote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.444" offset="12170215">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.444" offset="12174186">We agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.615" offset="12178888">When you put section 10(i), due to an occupational disease which does not immediately result in disability, together with that fact, that occupational hearing loss occurs immediately, then it is evident that subsection 23, the special retiree rules that Congress adopted in 1984, do not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.620" offset="12270839">What applies instead is the schedule, subsection 13, which specifically covers hearing loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.774" offset="12303440">It's a rather unsurprising conclusion, frankly, that the hearing loss provision should apply in this hearing loss case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.881" offset="12339907">Occupational hearing loss is different than asbestos-related diseases, and perhaps it's helpful to consider that in understanding subsection 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.762" offset="12411482">Asbestos fibers actually remain in the lungs and 10 or 20 years after the exposure to asbestos is removed, they may then develop into cancerous growths of mesothelioma, or they may then destroy enough of the lung that a worker has asbestosis, but the asbestos fibers stay in the lungs and continue to do damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.128" offset="12508867">When the worker is removed from the exposure to excessive noise on the job he suffers no further loss from that exposure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.827" offset="12551708">In its opening brief at page 16, Bath Iron Works recognized that this Court could decide the case by looking no farther than the words of section 10(i), but advised the Court not to adhere closely to what Congress has written.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.663" offset="12627045">It instead urges the Court to treat occupational hearing loss like asbestos-related diseases, because Senator Hatch mentioned Redick, the Benefits Review Board decision involving hearing loss, along with two asbestosis cases decided by the board and said that they represented inequitable policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.121" offset="12728922">As Chief Judge Briar said, and again we agree completely with his opinion for the First Circuit, Bath seeks to prove far too much on the basis of far too little.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.647" offset="12778973">Senator Hatch's disparagement of Redick is hardly a sufficient basis on which to rewrite the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.441" offset="12814186">In any event, we agree that Redick was inequitable, and we think the problems with that decision are... have been solved and are easy to solve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.858" offset="12863819">First, Congress adopted in 1984 at the same time it adopted the special rules in subsection 23, a special rule in hearing loss cases which is in subsection 13(d), which provides that the time to file a claim for hearing loss doesn't run until the audiogram report has been received, so there's no danger of workers losing the ability to bring these claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="3215.033" offset="12996521">Some of the briefs point out the fact that as a person ages the hearing tends to decrease, so that if you wait 5 or 10 years for your audiogram I presume you get a higher percentage of hearing loss than if it had been taken immediately upon retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.792" offset="13059528">Does the statute contemplate, in your view, that the compensation shall be measured by what the audiogram shows or what the actual hearing loss at the time of leaving employment was?</text>

            <text syncTime="3275.242" offset="13237370">We have suggested in our brief that if an employer would give an exit audiogram and freeze the amount of occupational hearing loss, that we don't... that it is the position of the director that the employer should not be liable for any subsequent age-related hearing loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.064" offset="13308632">I should note in this connection that OSHA has published regulations mandating exit audiograms in especially noisy injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.293" offset="13349592">This is recent, but it may well solve some of these important problems in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.807" offset="13375610">As I've said, I think section 10(i) is quite clear here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.115" offset="13424824">Let me just state that if there were any question about that, deference would be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.301" offset="13453559">In 1985, 1 year after the relevant amendments, the Secretary of Labor promulgated a regulation which we've reprinted at the very last page of the appendix to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.358" offset="13505804">The question was whether hearing loss claims should be treated like other accidental injuries listed in the schedule or whether they should be treated like asbestosis in terms of when you have to file your notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.303" offset="13569647">It's 30 days in the case of accidental injuries and a year in the case of asbestosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.645" offset="13594934">The Director said quite clearly 30 days, hearing loss is like an accidental injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.440" offset="13618130">But this isn't really a deference case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.890" offset="13639969">While the provisions of this act are complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.654" offset="13655015">As Chief Judge Briar concluded, when you come right down to it, it actually says something fairly simple: when an employee sustains a disability after retirement as the result of a latent disease, the special rules in subsection 23 apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.741" offset="13719381">In a hearing loss case, where the injury occurs immediately, subsection 13 applies.</text>

            <text syncTime="3410.127" offset="13776850">I wanted to cover the reasons why in my view the Director's interpretation of the statute is implausible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.810" offset="13819587">First, as mentioned earlier, the Director draws a distinction and tries to make that distinction important to the intent of Congress where there's no evidence that Congress intended the distinction to be important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.757" offset="13875384">There's no discussion in the legislative history with respect to the fact that hearing loss is somehow different than asbestosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.380" offset="13905895">Congress was concerned with the latency... or, with the delay in time between exposure and manifestation, and hearing loss has that same delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.983" offset="13952289">Secondly, if Congress had intended after the '84 amendments for all hearing loss claims for retirees and nonretirees to be treated under section 8(c)(13), there would have been language in 8(c)(13) to say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.055" offset="14012579">8(c)(13) says nothing about retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.352" offset="14021775">Third, if Congress had intended to exclude hearing loss claims from applicability from section 8(c)(23), the language of 8(c)(23) would be much different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.519" offset="14062421">The introductory phrase in section 8(c)(23) is, notwithstanding paragraphs (1) through (22).</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.328" offset="14097739">Obviously, (1) through (22) includes (13).</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.123" offset="14108919">If Congress had intended to exclude hearing loss claims from subsection (23), different language such as, notwithstanding paragraphs (1) through (12) and then (14) through (22) could have been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.993" offset="14160328">Instead, the opposite language is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.992" offset="14172344">That is, section 8(c)(13) is included in the language of 8(c)(23).</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.099" offset="14196795">Finally, the logical conclusion of the Director's argument... that is that section 910(i) is inapplicable to hearing loss claims... would take us back to the principle that the average weekly wage is determined at the time of last exposure, and that is clearly not the intent of Congress and was mentioned several times by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.558" offset="14290627">I also wanted to comment on the question of the hybrid approach at one time used by the Benefits Review Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.977" offset="14320302">Our position on that is there is simply no basis in logic in terms of interpreting the statute to arrive at that approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.568" offset="14350708">If section 910(i) is applicable, then section 910(d)(2) can be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.097" offset="14376726">If section 910(d)(2) is applicable, section 8(c)(23) has to be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.830" offset="14403685">There's just no way around it, and that's why that approach has been discredited at this point and there is no authority for that approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.262" offset="14429389">With respect to the question of waiver, I wanted to briefly discuss that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.572" offset="14454676">Justices Stevens and Scalia touched on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.321" offset="14465647">The waiver was with respect to the calculation of the average weekly wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.149" offset="14484978">That was mentioned in dicta by the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.569" offset="14494695">We have not waived the issue of whether section 8(c)(23) applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.692" offset="14511205">The waiver was very limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.440" offset="14522176">We're not trying to have the average weekly wage recalculated or recoup any benefits based on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.095" offset="14544746">It was a very limited waiver, not a waiver of the entire argument.</text>
