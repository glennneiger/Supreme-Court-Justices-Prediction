            <text syncTime="49.153" offset="335560">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="54.027" offset="355100">This case concerns the scope of the statutory innocent owner defense to a forfeiture of property under 21 U.S.C. 881(a)(6), the statute authorizing civil in rem forfeiture of proceeds of illegal drug transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.566" offset="429183">The Government's position in this case is that someone like Respondent Beth Ann Goodwin who receives a gift of drug profits and uses that money to purchase real property cannot assert a defense to forfeiture that is only available to innocent owners because that person does not own the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.868" offset="526463">Under Federal forfeiture statutes, title to property vests irreversibly in the Government when the act giving rise to forfeiture is committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.505" offset="565020">The United States owns the property from that point forward, and its interests cuts off all rights, including ownership rights, for anyone who subsequently acquires the property.</text>

            <text syncTime="119.687" offset="617683">Then the innocent owner defense is available only to someone in the chain of title before the forfeiture occurs?</text>

            <text syncTime="127.856" offset="650388">Someone has to have a preexisting, valid ownership interest before the acts giving rise to forfeiture occur so that someone like Ms. Goodwin is really in no better position, someone who receives the gift of drug profits, than someone who receives stolen money, a gift of stolen property.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.068" offset="723217">That person has no right to the property as against its true owner however innocently it was acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.330" offset="752266">So, in this case Respondent Beth Ann Goodwin is not the owner of the $200,000 in drug profits that she received from her companion, Mr. Brenna, nor does she own the residence that she purchased with that money.</text>

            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text syncTime="195.548" offset="921121">Your Honor, the answer to that question lies we believe not in construction of the innocent owner defense, but in what the word "proceeds" means.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.887" offset="958528">If there is a bilateral transaction, such as her buying the house from somebody and that person receiving the money, the question is does the word "proceeds" cover both sides of that bilateral, full-value transaction, or does it only cover one side.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.537" offset="1021118">We think that a reasonable construction of the word "proceeds" would cover just the house that she received and not necessarily the money that the particular seller received.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.140" offset="1235531">In light of... in the civil statute, in light of the narrow innocent owner defense, we think that the word "proceeds" arguably does not cover the money that goes to a seller if it's a bona fide transaction, there's no collusion, it's in good faith, and there's full value.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.663" offset="1321631">So, Your Honor, what I'm trying to say is that if there's help for bona fide purchasers in this statute, we don't think the help lies in twisting the innocent owner defense to apply to after-acquirers of property or persons who acquire their interest after the offense takes place.</text>

            <text syncTime="533.301" offset="2272174">What I'm saying is it's possible that through the definition of the word "proceeds", what proceeds means, in effect, Congress sort of negated that to the extent that if there's a full-value exchange... if the Government can go after one-half of that full-value exchange, in effect, the taint is purged from the other half.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.120" offset="2363394">I guess that's what I'm saying, but that's a matter of the meaning of the word "proceeds", not a wholesale suspension of the common law conventions of forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.099" offset="2407384">And the reason why it's important that there not be a wholesale suspension in this case is that that convention is not suspended when assets migrate from the original drug dealer into the hands of a person who receives it as a gift.</text>

            <text syncTime="1804.133" offset="7355498">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.351" offset="7372321">My name is Jim Plaisted, and I represent the respondent, Beth Ann Goodwin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.568" offset="7385278">If I may, I don't believe any of the many older cases that this Court has rendered decision in has ever construed an innocent owner provision nor proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.625" offset="7449435">In fact, I mean, it is fascinating, if I may for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.107" offset="7463436">If you go back to Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in Grundy and Thornburgh, you find that in that case, he talks about proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.353" offset="7500426">He talks about many of the things that have come up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.774" offset="7510039">And what he says in his efforts to protect an innocent owner, a bona fide purchaser, in that case, which he did, which he says, look, this statute which was... it's different because it doesn't say proceeds, but it says the ship, which was falsely registered, is forfeit or its value is forfeit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.123" offset="7607423">And then they sued the purchaser for the proceeds that he had transferred the ship for, and Justice Marshall said the statute doesn't have "proceeds" in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.228" offset="7655906">And we don't have a statute that has proceeds in it for another 160 years or so, until we start to get these most recent criminal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.834" offset="7690284">He... and civil statutes or quasi-criminal statutes, as this Court often calls them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.097" offset="7711391">What he also says is that in such a statute... and the way he protected the innocent owner there, despite the fact that none of these older statutes ever have innocent owner provisions either... he protected the innocent owner, the bona fide purchaser, by saying, well, the Government had an election in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.559" offset="7785160">And that's... I thought I detected a fair shift in the Government's positions from the brief, but at the least they leave themselves with an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.682" offset="7817657">And they leave themselves with an election to go after proceeds in different people's hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.429" offset="7844719">That concept threatens house transactions where there is a person who is involved in drugs in the chain of title for later purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.501" offset="7892994">It threatens resales of cars that also are sometimes and often involved in the drug trade and then later are resold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.343" offset="7924341">And so, Congress, when it adopted this provision about traceability in this particular statute... and I presume in the others... it adopted as well a protective device so that we didn't have unfair takings from people who were innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.726" offset="7989856">And what they said... and it's a... it's not statement simply from somebody on the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.896" offset="8014515">It's not a... just one of the House reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.613" offset="8021412">In the joint statement... because this was a bill that was passed in the House, and then the Senate's words were put into it in this particular pertinent provisions, that is, with respect to the innocent owner provision and I believe with respect to proceeds as well when it was adopted in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.217" offset="8087867">They said a couple things that reflect what is the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.276" offset="8108034">And if I can read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.432" offset="8112736">It does appear in the U.S. Code and Congressional Administrative Reports at 9522.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.774" offset="8134052">They said due to the penal nature of forfeiture statutes, it's the intent of these provisions that the property will be forfeit only if there's a substantial connection between the property and the criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.941" offset="8186715">And then they went on and, more pointedly for our purposes here, said finally, it should be pointed out that no property would be forfeited under the Senate amendment to the extent of the interest of any innocent owner of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.434" offset="8252648">And then they said the term "owner" should be broadly construed and interpreted to include any person with a cognizable or legal equitable interest in the property, and then, as if to add a final sentence that addresses our issues here, said specifically the property would not be subject to forfeiture unless the owner of such property knew or consented to the fact that... and the second thing is... that the property was proceeds traceable to an illegal exchange, in essence, saying the person has to know.</text>

            <text syncTime="2612.857" offset="10590398">In terms of... as I had understood the Government's argument previously, I thought they were saying they did have the right to elect to go after even bona fide purchasers in some instance, and even if it is only in limited instances, it creates an anomaly and a problem when you construe the criminal statute which protects bona fide purchasers specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.485" offset="10708889">Congress knew how to protect bona fide purchasers alone when they wanted to, and they said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.748" offset="10729996">And when you put next to it the civil statute... and the reason I say that is because the civil statute is a statute addressed to in rem actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.603" offset="10769389">It is a statute that if a person who is under indictment and has made a bona fide sale... if the Government can no longer reach that asset under the criminal statute, under the civil statute, if the Government elects to do so, and if their construction of the innocent owner provision stands, and if they do have the right to go after those things, they can impact, detract from, and I had thought completely override the bona fide purchaser provision in the criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.449" offset="10904808">And so, the only way to make sense of both together is to understand that the civil statute has been drafted to be much more far-reaching and the protection is more far-reaching.</text>

            <text syncTime="3221.612" offset="13025428">Your Honor, I would... as I had understood the Government's brief, they were taking the position... if you look at footnote 8, they had suggested in footnote 8 that the innocent owner provision had meaning only for people who took before the illegal transaction not for anybody after.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.769" offset="13161996">And so, if one reads 8, the Government's brief suggested that they were, in fact, reserving the right to attack bona fide purchasers for value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.486" offset="13196896">If that was or if they are even reserving the right to opt for that, then there is no meaning to the innocent owner clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.917" offset="13246633">I mean, it becomes meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.682" offset="13253738">The example in 8 where they posit, well, it's... and it starts midway down through footnote 8 where they posit it is possible for funds to be entrusted to a person and that person subsequently uses them to engage in a drug transaction without the owner's knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.268" offset="13328031">The sum of money might be turned over to a friend for investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.907" offset="13342555">So, A turns it over to B, a banker or a broker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.265" offset="13352063">The banker or the broker uses it instead for drugs, and then the Government later seizes proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.139" offset="13379544">The Government posited in that case that that gave meaning to innocent owner because the ownership was before the illegal acts, and from that at least we drew that they were attacking all bona fide purchasers or at least reserving the right to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.710" offset="13441820">If they are doing that, that particular section provides... when you read it, you never find an example like that in any case cited to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.908" offset="13482571">And we suggested that in our brief and challenged the Government to provide one, and they did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.781" offset="13506081">But if you think about that, the example they proffer, it has no meaning either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.171" offset="13527606">If A gives the money to B, B uses it, and the Government seizes it, A going to the Government and saying, well, B owes me money that I entrusted him to and you happened to have seized proceeds from this fellow, turn them over to me, a private citizen has no right of tracing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.179" offset="13591658">He has a debt owed from B, but he can't go claim that against the Government, and I would submit that's why there are no cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.160" offset="13627603">It is... if not meaningless, it's virtually meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.846" offset="13638365">And I would ask this Court not to give that construction to this clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.797" offset="13666159">Congress chose the words when they know... when they wanted to express bona fide purchaser, they said so, and they said it in the criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.278" offset="13696044">In this particular statute, they made a very broad statute, a statute that is far broader than the criminal statute.</text>
