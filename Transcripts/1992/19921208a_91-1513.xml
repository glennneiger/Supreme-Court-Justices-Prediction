            <label>Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="59.760" offset="367870">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="63.702" offset="383648">For more than 200 years, Congress has determined the priority of Federal claims against insolvent debtors.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.620" offset="423354">The Federal priority statute, section 3713 of title 31, provides that claims of the United States in nonbankruptcy proceedings shall be paid first.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.667" offset="475495">This Court has repeatedly held that only the plainest inconsistency would warrant our finding an implied exception to the operation of so clear a command.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.055" offset="521052">The question in this case is whether the McCarran-Ferguson Act created an exception to the clear command of section 3713.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.160" offset="557519">In our view, it did not, and our argument has three basic points.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.464" offset="578731">First, the McCarran Act exemption applies to the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.519" offset="598897">A State statute regulating the priority of claims against the estate of an insolvent insurance company does not regulate any business activity of insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.125" offset="641320">Consequently, it is not a regulation of the business of insurance within the ordinary meaning of those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.579" offset="667129">Second, the State priority statute does not possess the three characteristics of the regulation of the business of insurance identified in this Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.856" offset="712269">It does not result in the transfer or spreading of risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.719" offset="727733">It is not an integral part of the contractual relationship between insurer and insured, and it involves entities wholly outside the insurance industry.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="159.825" stopTime="194.659">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="159.825" offset="768171">Well, may I ask, Mr. Long why the statute doesn't perhaps meet the National Securities test since it is aimed at protecting directly or indirectly the relationship between the insurer and the insured to the extent that it covers the payout in the event of insolvency.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.393" offset="886453">I mean, there... to that extent, it seems to perhaps meet the test.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="194.659" offset="907455">Well, let me give a two-part answer to that question.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="197.220" stopTime="203.713">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="197.220" offset="917695">Well, maybe not the whole statute, but insofar as it protects the insured.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_a_long_jr" startTime="203.713" stopTime="255.311">
            <label>Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="203.713" offset="943713">Well, first of all, I think the test that this Court has developed in cases since National Securities is a three-part test.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.800" offset="984046">It's considerably narrower than simply whether the State regulation has some effect on the risk that the policyholder will not be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.199" offset="1033679">We think that test would be too broad if it were simply reduced back to that single factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.283" offset="1058025">The other part of the answer is, in fact, the priority statute has relatively little to do with whether a policyholder's claim is paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.438" offset="1090626">Of course, it only comes into play in the event that the insurer becomes insolvent, and that's likely to be viewed as a relatively unlikely event by a policyholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.077" offset="1133153">If it does happen, though, the real insurance against insolvency--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="255.311" offset="1150081">Well, it's more likely these days, isn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="257.370" offset="1158335">It might be a real concern.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_a_long_jr" startTime="258.863" stopTime="279.677">
            <label>Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="258.863" offset="1164291">--It may be more likely these days, and if it is a real concern of a policyholder, the real insurance against insolvency is not the priority statute, it is insurance guaranty funds, which have been established by all 50 States to pay claims of policyholders in the event the insurance company becomes insolvent.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="279.677" stopTime="291.495">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="279.677" offset="1247570">Well, that may be, but I still think to the extent that the statute tries to deal with this situation, that it may very well be covered by McCarran-Ferguson.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_a_long_jr" startTime="291.495" stopTime="323.825">

            <text syncTime="291.495" offset="1294799">Well, to the extent that it does and that it meets the other factors that this Court has identified, it could be, but as I say, we don't think that it is... has a... is sufficiently close to the contractual relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.565" offset="1363135">It only applies in the event of insolvency.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.457" offset="1374629">Then the guaranty fund is what steps in to pay the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.249" offset="1385810">And, you know, if the policyholder were required to rely on the priority statute, it would not provide a very good assurance because--</text>

            <text syncTime="346.620" offset="1515377">In the event that there is an insolvency and the guaranty fund does not cover a claim, if the assets of the insolvent insurance company were sufficient, it is true that a policyholder might recover a portion of his claim I would think in the typical case; in an unusual case, the entire claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.283" offset="1589983">But that possibility is not enough to bring the statute within the regulation of the business of insurance.</text>

            <text syncTime="386.808" offset="1676082">Well, we think it does not come within the ordinary meaning of the business of insurance because it doesn't regulate any business activity of insurers.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="405.698" offset="1751629">Well, but at the point where this statute comes into play, the insurance company has been declared insolvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.535" offset="1782975">All of its assets have been taken over by a liquidator.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.816" offset="1792066">Its business has been wound up, and the question is who gets the assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.318" offset="1810143">There are different categories of claimants lined up, and--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="425.213" offset="1829682">But surely, how those assets are disposed of can very plausibly be argued to be a part of the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.368" offset="1862283">How do you liquidate an insurance company when it goes bust?</text>

            <text syncTime="437.459" offset="1878688">--Well, as I say, in our view because it's not a regulation of the business activities of the insurers, it should not be held to be a regulation of the business of insurance, and we don't think it meets the three-part test that this Court has identified, which is considerably more discriminating than simply a question of whether this statute may lead to the payment of a policyholder's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.727" offset="1987775">And even to the extent you focus on that single factor, we think that the priority statute is really not very good protection in most cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.525" offset="2034900">It's not something a policyholder, when he enters into a policy of insurance, is likely to think about as an important protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.679" offset="2067606">There may be an analogy to if you deposit your money in the bank, you might think about the Federal Deposit Insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.364" offset="2094355">That's equivalent to the guaranty fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.787" offset="2108043">It's unlikely you would think, well, the priority of claims in the event of insolvency is something that's also important.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.081" offset="2133225">It's simply too remote from the contract of insurance.</text>

            <text syncTime="505.563" offset="2151093">Well, insurance companies are rated for solvency and financial strength all the time, and that's one of the first things a policyholder looks to.</text>

            <text syncTime="538.057" offset="2281078">--Well, of course, this statute applies if the State's regulations that are designed to protect the solvency of insurance companies fail and the insurance company is not solvent, but then the protection is the guaranty fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.966" offset="2344713">That's what insures that the claim is paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.900" offset="2360491">Let me discuss the three factors that this Court has identified as relevant to determining whether a statute regulates the business of insurance because the test is broader than simply whether the statute was enacted to protect policyholders or whether it may affect the likelihood of a claim being paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.453" offset="2450665">In the Variable Annuity Life Insurance case, the Court concluded that the concept of insurance must involve some investment risk taking on the part of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.119" offset="2493297">In the National Securities case, the Court held that the Federal securities laws applied to a merger of insurance companies that had been approved by State insurance regulators.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.357" offset="2542303">It concluded that the McCarran Act did not make the States supreme in regulating all the activities of insurance companies and that State laws aimed at protecting the interests of shareholders are not laws regulating the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.877" offset="2600399">Then in the Royal Drug case, the Court held that agreements between an insurer and pharmacies to supply prescription drugs to policyholders were not part of the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.728" offset="2655779">And most recently in Union Labor Life Insurance against Pireno, the Court held that an insurer's use of a peer review committee to determine whether policyholder claims are covered by the insurance contract is also not the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.758" offset="2723906">So, the Court has developed a three-factor test... and it's a rather demanding test... to define the boundaries of the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.733" offset="2759746">The practice must have the effect of transferring or spreading risk from the policyholder to the insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.797" offset="2788063">It must be an integral part of the policy relationship, and it must be limited to entities in the insurance industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="717.354" offset="2998296">It says that the risk is transferred at the time the contract is entered, and whether or not the claim is paid is not what the transfer of risk is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.291" offset="3046048">And there's also no risk spreading because that requires independent risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.762" offset="3059945">Here we're talking about the risk of insolvency.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.075" offset="3069140">All the policyholders and, indeed, all the creditors of the insurance company face precisely the same risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.238" offset="3093800">So, let me turn to the second factor, which is the one that is troubling you, whether it's an integral part of the relationship between the insurer and the insured.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.706" offset="3139671">Now, again, in Pireno, the Court defined that rather narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.677" offset="3155553">It noted first that it was distinct from the question whether the insurance contract is valid and the amount of the policyholder's claim under the contract... and that's true here as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.167" offset="3209470">It's quite separate from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.588" offset="3219188">And the priority statute also doesn't address the relationship between the insurer and the insured.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.392" offset="3242384">It really addresses the relationship among all the creditors of this insurance company that has become insolvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.228" offset="3269761">And of course, many of those creditors are not policyholders, and some of them come ahead of policyholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.101" offset="3297242">And as we were discussing earlier, we don't believe that the Ohio statute so closely affects the reliability interpretation and enforcement of the contract as to satisfy this factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.181" offset="3349591">We concede that it has some effect on the reliability in the sense that it may in some cases determine whether a part of a policyholder claim, in a very unusual case the entire claim, is paid, but this Court's decisions make clear that some effect is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.663" offset="3423465">Broadly viewed, any State regulation of insurance could be said to affect the reliability of the insurance contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.359" offset="3458260">Certainly in Pireno the peer review committee, which the very purpose of it was to decide whether claims were covered and should be paid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1015.059" offset="4189062">We think the purpose and enactment history of the McCarran Act, which is something this Court has considered in its prior cases, strongly indicate that Congress did not allow... intend to allow the States to determine the priority of claims against the United... claims of the United States against insolvent insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.231" offset="4277774">The Federal priority statute that's at issue in this case is one of the oldest statutes of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.195" offset="4305673">It was enacted in 1789.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.678" offset="4315599">It was the fifth statute enacted by the first Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.972" offset="4332735">It has remained in effect throughout the history of the United States with very little substantive change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.455" offset="4354678">It provides that claims of the United States in nonbankruptcy proceedings shall be paid first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.440" offset="4382577">And as I said, the Court has held in three case, Moore, Key, and Emory, that only the plainest inconsistency would warrant our finding an implied exception to the operation of so clear a command.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.497" offset="4434822">It's uncontested, by the way, that the Federal priority statute applies to the claims at issue in this case, and would preempt the State priority statute unless it's blocked by the McCarran Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.177" offset="4485604">And we don't believe, looking at the purpose in history of the McCarran Act, that this is what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.151" offset="4509428">And we look first... I think the best way to understand this is chronologically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.593" offset="4531266">If you look first at 1936, in that year this Court decided a case, United States against Knott, Knott, that involved the application of the Federal priority statute to claims of the United States against an insolvent insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.516" offset="4602946">And in that case, the Court held that the Federal priority statute applied, and it preempted an inconsistent State law, a Florida law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1243.776" offset="5103975">There's actually a difficult problem of draftsmanship that occurs when you may have two competing priority systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.800" offset="5128007">But Congress may have felt that if it's not writing the priorities and Federal judges are not applying them, that it's going to stick with the old first priority from 1798, and we don't think that's unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.201" offset="5185686">But let me get back to our... very quickly go through our argument about purpose and enactment history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.333" offset="5210136">8 years after Knott in 1944, the Court decided the South-Eastern Underwriters case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.028" offset="5236990">It held that the business of insurance is interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.792" offset="5252037">That was what precipitated the McCarran-Ferguson Act 1 year later in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.906" offset="5276487">And this Court has recognized time and time again that McCarran was a response to South-Eastern Underwriters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.000" offset="5300833">It was basically intended to turn back the clock to the days prior to that decision by giving back to the States their traditional authority to tax and regulate the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.926" offset="5352556">Congress made clear that it did not intend to confer any additional regulatory authority on the States that they did not possess prior to South-Eastern Underwriters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.875" offset="5396337">And, of course, this Court had held in Knott, prior to South-Eastern Underwriters, that the States had no authority to overrule the Federal priority statute in insurance company insolvency proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.202" offset="5441686">And it's not surprising that the Court reached that result in Knott and reached it unanimously because prior to South-Eastern Underwriters and prior to the McCarran Act, even under the narrow view of the Commerce Clause that prevailed as to insurance companies at that time, it was clear that Congress had the power to enact a Federal priority statute under the Bankruptcy Clause, under a separate head of power under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.970" offset="5548683">So, we think it would be extraordinary to conclude that in enacting the McCarran Act, Congress intended to expand the regulatory authority of the States beyond the authority that they had traditionally exercised and to leave the determination of the priority of claims of the United States entirely to the States, which predictably would result in the kind of priority statute that we have here where the claims of the United States are not only subordinated to claims of policyholders, but also to claims of general creditors, which of course can't possibly be justified on the basis of protecting policyholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.915" offset="5708553">So, to summarize our argument, we think the Ohio priority statute falls outside the ordinary meaning of the business of insurance because it does not regulate any business activity of insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.304" offset="5766022">We think it does not satisfy this Court's three-part test for defining the business of insurance, which is a narrow and demanding test, and finally, it was clearly not part of the States' traditional authority, prior to South-Eastern Underwriters and the McCarran Act, to regulate the priority of claims of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.229" offset="5845748">And the McCarran Act was passed to restore, but not expand the States' authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1863.653" offset="7583413">As he says in his brief, you have to appreciate the pedigree of Pireno, and I would also say that's the essence of Pireno.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.188" offset="7613611">And that comes from National Securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.289" offset="7621970">And the real essence of this whole question is whether or not the State law is aimed at protecting regulating the relationship between the company and its policyholders either directly and indirectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.966" offset="7668677">If so, those laws are the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.709" offset="7683723">With respect to the three tests of Pireno, if I could start with the third test, the statute only applies to insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.435" offset="7718623">It's limited to an entity that's in the insurance business, and that's the insolvent company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.538" offset="7738998">And all the claims against the insurance company are claims against the insurance company.</text>

            <text syncTime="1909.994" offset="7768778">Now, as to this third test, the Government interjects a requirement that I don't think is in this Court's opinions or is logical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.648" offset="7799393">And they state in their brief that the regulation has to be peculiar or unique to the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.505" offset="7830845">I don't read that anyplace in the Court's cases, nor does it make any sense because licensing is not a unique form of State regulation of insurance, but licensing or State laws which regulate the licensing of an insurance company clearly regulate the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.585" offset="7895211">As to the second test of Pireno, the Ohio statute reinforces the contractual relationship between the insurer and insured, and--</text>

            <text syncTime="2083.818" offset="8464158">Now, as to the second criteria, as I said, we believe it's integral with the whole policy relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.301" offset="8494042">It undergirds that relationship at a time when the policyholder is truly in a situation where they may not get paid, and it also satisfies the first prong of the Pireno test because it effectuates on a continuing basis the actual spreading of risk among policyholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.728" offset="8583798">The arguments by the Government as to the guaranty fund, our response to that is, yes, guaranty funds exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.006" offset="8644925">Yes, they pay some policyholder claims, but that doesn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.621" offset="8667286">The best evidence of the fact that guaranty funds are not the panacea that might be suggested is the fact that the Federal Government's claim for $10.7 million is still unpaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.569" offset="8715142">It's not covered by any guaranty fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.411" offset="8722456">Like many claims against the insurance company here, they're not covered by the guaranty funds because they arose out of bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.187" offset="8757565">Guaranty funds... and I'll use Ohio's as an indication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.409" offset="8774492">The Ohio guaranty fund has a definition of what's a covered claim, and then it has 18 enumerated exceptions from that coverage.</text>

            <text syncTime="2173.058" offset="8821095">So, as to those policyholders whose claims are not covered by guaranty funds or are not covered in whole by guaranty funds, the only chance they have to receive the protection they purchased is through the insolvency procedures in the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.089" offset="8889222">As to the Knott decision, I thought that the Solicitor General did an excellent job of distinguishing that case from this case in his reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.139" offset="8941362">On page 14, his footnote number 9, I believe, the last sentence at the bottom of the page says Federal... Knott, and he gives the citation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.703" offset="8987651">Federal priority statute inapplicable if State statute divests insurance company of title to assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.767" offset="9011893">I think that's a very succinct holding of this Court's decision in Knott.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.992" offset="9036866">And then I'd ask you to look at appendix page A in our brief, section 3903.18 of the Ohio Revised Code, another section of our insurance liquidation act, which says the liquidator shall be vested by operation of law with the title to all of the property, contracts, and rights of action and all of the books and records of the insurer ordered liquidated, wherever located, as of the entry of the final order of liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.940" offset="9152641">So, what didn't happen in Knott happened here, and that as a matter of law, the title to the assets passed to the superintendent of insurance, and Knott is just plainly not applicable to this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2670.104" offset="10809222">When it wanted the United States to have any position other than first, it said so, and it has done that in the Federal bankruptcy act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2819.092" offset="11405232">And also, this practice of the States of prioritizing claims and placing the United States rather low seems to have begun only in the late '60's in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.428" offset="11446610">It's a fairly recent development.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.641" offset="11455387">We don't have claims in every insurance company insolvency proceeding because we often don't have any bonds with the company and may not have any tax claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.226" offset="11493735">The basic argument here today by respondent is that any State law aimed at protecting policyholders is a regulation of the business of insurance within the meaning of McCarran-Ferguson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.785" offset="11552040">We think that is too broad a definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.877" offset="11564370">We think that is inconsistent with this Court's prior decisions, and in particular, that would be inconsistent with the antitrust... the application of the antitrust laws to the business of insurance, which is also at issue here and is also an interest of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.000" offset="11632811">So, we urge the Court not to reject its prior decisions and adopt that much broader test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.103" offset="11661232">I mean, it really is true that in a general sense every State law regulating insurance companies is aimed at protecting policyholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.779" offset="11695922">And finally, very briefly, on the third factor, there was a argument that something that's not unique to the insurance industry shouldn't be covered by this factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.949" offset="11756631">In fact, the purpose of that factor, this Court has said, is to recognize the importance of intra-industry competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.254" offset="11789859">Congress thought that was particularly important in the insurance business that insurance companies needed to cooperate on rates and statistical information and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.953" offset="11832700">So, we think that is actually a relevant consideration, although again our principal submission under that factor is that a lot of these claims involve the ordinary business relationships of an insurance company with suppliers of goods and services like the relationship in Royal Drug with pharmacies that this Court said was not a part of the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.840" offset="11916187">If there are no further questions, I thank the Court.</text>
