            <text syncTime="60.835" offset="384623">The issue in this employment discrimination case alleging racial discrimination in demotion and discharge is whether a district court is compelled as a matter of law, because of a finding of pretext, to enter a judgment for the employee even though he found as a matter of fact that there was no intentional discrimination and believed as a matter of fact there was no intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.716" offset="480231">The answer to that question is no because, as this Court said in Aikens, once legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons have been articulated for the employment decision, no presumption operates and the trier of fact must make a factual determination about whether there was intentional discrimination or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.818" offset="560584">Aikens rejected a rigid, mechanistic, and ritualistic method of factfinding, a method that I think would straitjacket factfinders and actually obstruct the truth-seeking process.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.719" offset="612202">If rejected a method like the method appearing on page 18 of the employee's brief on the merits, a method... a diagram type method which typifies a rigid approach to factfinding, which should not be taken in employment discrimination cases.</text>
