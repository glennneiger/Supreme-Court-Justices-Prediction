            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="140443">We'll hear argument next in No. 111 Original, the State of Delaware v. the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.488" offset="182343">Mr. Lyons.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dennis_g_lyons" startTime="45.382" stopTime="142.967">
            <label>Mr. Dennis G. Lyons</label>
            <text syncTime="45.382" offset="321942">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="48.963" offset="336257">This case started as a sort of a collection case brought in this Court by Delaware against New York to enforce Delaware's rights under the clear teachings of the backup rule promulgated by this Court in the Texas case in the mid-1960's and reaffirmed by this Court in the Pennsylvania case in the early 1970's.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.470" offset="442314">The property in question was so-called overages.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.526" offset="470526">These occur when an issuer of securities pays a dividend to its holders of record and you have a broker or some other party that holds for customers or clients as a holder of record, and what the issuer pays is more than what the broker owes to its customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.023" offset="576479">It also occurs when the brokers are paid by the Depository Trust Company, which we will call the DTC, which is a nominee custodian set up by a cadre of brokers and custodian banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.824" offset="639695">The property is owed here to unknowns.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.556" offset="658608">That is the agreed position of 49 of the States except for New York, which says that it may be owed to knowns, but it can't identify who they are at this point.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="142.967" stopTime="146.978">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="142.967" offset="712211">Why does this occur so often and generate so much revenue?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dennis_g_lyons" startTime="146.978" stopTime="295.896">
            <label>Mr. Dennis G. Lyons</label>
            <text syncTime="146.978" offset="728303">It occurs, I believe, because of the activities in the securities markets, that you have an issuer who's maintaining a record, you have securities which are traded, and they sometimes get traded in semibearer form.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.988" offset="796325">In other words, a stock certificate comes out, it is endorsed and negotiable in blank form, and it passed from hand to hand, and the issuer, of course, doesn't know about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.968" offset="848257">It pays the record, and that results in someone being overpaid and someone being underpaid, and I think it has to do with the volume of trading and the fact that we have a stock-certificate-based trading system in most areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.850" offset="923803">This does not involve the primary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.452" offset="942193">The case is narrowly drawn simply to involve the backup rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.226" offset="965285">The primary rule, of course, involves lost stockholders, people who are on the record but who the issuer can't find, who the issuer has addresses for but has lost touch with, and lost customers of brokers, and we estimate in our brief... there is no evidence in the record... that the universe of the primary rule here, the escheats, is much larger than that of the backup rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.815" offset="1071656">What started as a collection case turned into a stampede.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.697" offset="1095166">One by one, 48 States intervened, and they came up with a position that was different from the positions that were quite common between the plaintiff and the defendant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.157" offset="1153054">The effect of these positions was to enlarge the size of the universe that was in issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.524" offset="1190461">The property that Delaware sought was the property in the hands of the brokers who were incorporated in Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.130" offset="1220867">The property that the intervenors sought for themselves was the property in the hands of the DTC, a very considerable amount of property, the property in the hands of the Delaware brokers, the property in the hands of the brokers incorporated elsewhere, and the property in the hands of the New York custodian banks, which make a specialty upholding securities for customers.</text>

            <text syncTime="561.641" offset="2386974">Before the break, I was making the point that State law should govern who the debtor is for the purpose of characterization of the backup rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.088" offset="2436711">Under the State law, very clearly the brokers are not the issuer's agent, and the issuer is no longer a debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.066" offset="2476626">The issuer has paid the holders of record, and accordingly has no further obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.748" offset="2499405">It is only the brokers and the other intermediaries who have an obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.842" offset="2515810">They are a debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.851" offset="2519780">To be sure, they owe the money to somebody else, and they don't know who they owe it to, but the issuer is not a debtor, nor is the issuer their creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.118" offset="2564815">As I was saying, the only basis for applying Federal common law here is to create a rule that comes out differently from the rule as it would come out under the laws of all 50 of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.649" offset="2626987">What we have, I think, is a change for the sake of change, and a change for a purpose that was rejected in the Texas case itself, where it was contended that the mineral rights proceeds should go back and escheat to the State of Texas because it was from Texas soil that they had sprung, and the Court rejected that theory and said that those properties, like the rest, would be distributed under the primary rule if there was a known creditor with a last-known address and otherwise under the backup rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.384" offset="2773899">The Master, besides making what I think is a change in the rule that the debtor should be the debtor, which he did not acknowledge as a change, made an acknowledged change by changing the State of reference for the debtor from being the State of incorporation of the debtor to the State of principal executive office.</text>

            <text syncTime="738.827" offset="3095728">It's interesting to note that the rules set down in the agreement for that clearinghouse quite clearly identify the holder as the debtor and the State of incorporation of the holder as the State of reference... 44 States signed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.387" offset="3169916">The Master made this change of his own accord.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.581" offset="3194680">The States that were contending for the issuer as debtor at that time were contending for the State of incorporation as the reference for the issuer, or for whoever was the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.061" offset="3252672">This was a spontaneous change.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.364" offset="3261867">There was no discovery on the merits of making the change.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.466" offset="3274301">There was no discovery as to really what a principal executive office was and what reference it had to the productive facilities of a corporation, and it appears from business publications and surveys that we have quoted in our brief, not having had a chance for discovery, that there is very little connection between the principal executive office, which is the Master's rule, and the productive activities of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.536" offset="3398539">It's just the place where the executive officers, the top brass, have their headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.400" offset="3421945">It seems to me that if the Court does not adopt the issuer as debtor rule, that the change falls of its own weight, because the Master placed great weight on the fact that the 10-Q report and the 10-K report that issuers of securities file contain this information, and you have grievous difficulties applying the change rule once you get beyond the realm of the issuer.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.978" offset="3532286">But in any event, the basis that the Master gave for making the change from the State of incorporation was that it was fairer because it spread the money around more thoroughly.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.347" offset="3581814">In other words, not to put too fine a point on it, Delaware had too many incorporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.561" offset="3606683">Let me say that no corporation is required to incorporate in Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.752" offset="3631447">Delaware's statute is not copyrighted.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.516" offset="3642419">It can be copied by another State, and some of them have.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.298" offset="3657570">What brings corporations to Delaware is a perception that it's judiciary and that it's legislature function in the best interests of stockholders and in the best interests of corporate management at the same time, that they have a balanced approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.850" offset="3723816">The rule of the State of incorporation is a rule which creates an equality of opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.924" offset="3756103">In other words, it is not that the money goes to Delaware, the money goes to whatever State the debtor was incorporated in if the backup rule is applicable and every State has an equal opportunity to do that, and if they could equal Delaware's record and the record of its Court of Chancery over the 200 years that it has been in existence, I think that it would be a healthy thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.951" offset="3860175">There's clearly no administrative ease in the change.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.064" offset="3876685">The administration, even in the context of issuer as debtor, is probably more difficult, and once you get beyond the area of issuer as debtor, where you do not have a 10-K and a 10-Q to serve as your pole star, then you have a rule which is difficult of administration, and I don't see any limiting principle in the Master's report that limits the change in the rule to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.916" offset="4008028">What we have, then, is change for change's sake, I believe.</text>

            <text syncTime="1002.139" offset="4148985">The Master's report is propelled by the notion that it would be fairer to distribute the unclaimed distributions in question widely among the States rather than to New York or New York and Delaware as a straightforward application of the Texas rule's command.</text>

            <text syncTime="1085.882" offset="4483875">That's New York's position, that the Court has told New York and all States 27 years ago in Texas v. New Jersey that it was setting down very clear rules for establishing State's rights in determining what those escheat rights are and intangible obligations, and the Court reaffirmed that in Pennsylvania v.

            <text syncTime="1124.898" offset="4639983">That's correct, Your Honor, and I would suggest... New York would suggest if there's something particularly unfair in this particular context about distributing or escheating these funds pursuant to the existing black letter escheat rules as set down by this Court, we would suggest that institutionally it would be better if it were left to Congress to make those changes as it did with respect to the Western Union money orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.468" offset="4750219">But if this case were to be decided on fairness grounds, I would point out that beneficial... excuse me, brokers and other financial institution intermediaries do have beneficial rights in these funds, as I will elaborate, because our argument proceeds... our primary rule argument, which I'd like to now focus on, proceeds from the traditional understanding of the primary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.895" offset="4855963">That is, you identify... the right to escheat belongs to the State of the creditor as identified on the broker's books in applying the last-known address principle.</text>

            <text syncTime="1220.482" offset="5022311">There's no dispute by Delaware nor any other party in this litigation that those funds would escheat to New York under the traditional understanding of the backup rule, New York being the State of incorporation for those entities.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bernard Nash</label>
            <text syncTime="2200.033" offset="8940574">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.892" offset="8995953">I speak today on behalf of 44 States in support of the recommendations made by the Special Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.067" offset="9028659">A threshold issue before the Court is which State should escheat unclaimed securities distributions that become stuck in the hands of financial intermediaries in the course of transmission from issuers to beneficial owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.008" offset="9096472">The Special Master recommended that the State of the issuer has a superior equitable claim over the State of whatever intermediary happens to be holding the distribution when it becomes stuck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.520" offset="9158435">The existence of intermediaries, he held, does not change the fundamental economic relationship between the issuer and its investor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.895" offset="9200022">The intermediary never had and does not now have any ownership interest in the distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.131" offset="9236907">If it did, it would not be unclaimed property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.904" offset="9252058">The Special Master's conclusion was fully consistent with the precedents of this Court... in Texas v. New Jersey and Pennsylvania v. New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.422" offset="9298033">We agree that those precedents should be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.864" offset="9315796">In Texas v. New Jersey, the ruling of this Court accorded escheat priority to the State of the issuer, not to the State of any intermediary, the issuer being Sun Oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.192" offset="9373161">There were intermediaries, transfer agents and paying agents, in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.176" offset="9397090">Delaware and New York segment into a number of separate transactions the payment of dividends and interest by an issuer to its stockholders as those distributions are transmitted through brokerage firms and other intermediaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.510" offset="9466471">The Master correctly rejected their segmentation and State-law-based theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.204" offset="9497191">He explicitly utilized this Court's guiding principles of fairness and ease of administration in his recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.220" offset="9533240">In Texas v. New Jersey, this Court held fairness to be one of two criteria, and this Court defined fairness to accord escheat priority to the State that gave the benefits of its economy and laws to the company whose business activities made the intangible property come into existence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2439.870" offset="9899894">He explained in his recommendation that in this type of a transaction there are multiple intermediaries, that the issuer is a debtor for certain aspects of State law, the intermediaries are debtors for certain aspects of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.541" offset="9970530">The Uniform Commercial Code merely accords the issuer an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.674" offset="9999055">The only statute before the Court in 1965 in Texas v. New Jersey was the Pennsylvania escheat statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.181" offset="10037090">That Pennsylvania escheat statute, which is attached to the Master's report in the original 1965 case, defined holder as someone indebted to another, which therefore meant Sun Oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.764" offset="10111486">It also defined holder as someone in possession of the property, which meant the transfer agents and paying agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.059" offset="10144610">The only explicit discussion of State law in Texas v. New Jersey resulted in the Court expressly rejecting State-law-based rules relating to technical concepts of domicile, choice of law, and Texas' claim that State law, which defined mineral interests and royalties as real property, should control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.116" offset="10248890">In Standard Oil v. New Jersey in 1951, the Court explicitly rejected the Uniform Stock Transfer Act as a basis for defining the Federal law of escheat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.024" offset="10296538">The Delaware-New York State-law-based approach is inconsistent with this Court's general policy of not deciding original jurisdiction cases based on State law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dennis G. Lyons</label>

            <text syncTime="3840.805" offset="15503578">In reply to the argument of New York that the property here really could be shown to be primary rule property, I would urge not only the point that Justice Scalia made, that there are findings of the Master that impede that conclusion, but that it involves the proof of what I believe to be an impossibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.590" offset="15594797">And that is that I, from my records, can ascertain who owns a stock certificate which is essentially in bearer form that I gave to Mr. X on October 15, who holds that stock certificate on November 15, which is the record date for the dividend, because it is that person and those claiming under him who have the claim, and there is no way my records as the debtor, as the delivering broker, can show who owned that certificate, who had that certificate in his vault, at any moment after the time I delivered it to the first party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.374" offset="15753935">Addressing the arguments of the intervenors, it is said that the issuer under State law is one of many debtors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.791" offset="15799597">We say that is not so, that section 8-207 of the Uniform Commercial Code says that the issuer is not a debtor once it has paid the holder of record, and that is what has happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.983" offset="15856335">The issuer is not a debtor under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.943" offset="15872113">It is said to be an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.926" offset="15884130">Yes, it's an affirmative defense called payment, and payment is a very good affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3942.190" offset="15909103">It's the best affirmative defense on a note that I can imagine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.934" offset="15924149">The location rule as to whether we will admittedly change the rules from the State of incorporation to the State of principal executive office, obviously implicates the hard core rules of stare decisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.264" offset="15993426">This is a rule laid down by the Court in emphatic terms that it was setting a permanent rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.570" offset="16022683">Justice Black says that over and over, and that was the treatment given it in the Western Union case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4011.747" offset="16187359">Here, Congress can because these are clearly in commerce, these distributions, and also Congress has certain powers under section 5 of the due process clause which is also functional, but in this area, clearly you have distributions in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4027.866" offset="16251829">They're the same basis as for the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.848" offset="16263741">Finally, it is said that there are changes in circumstance from 1965 to 1992 making the State of incorporation rule obsolete.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.006" offset="16304387">There are none.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.056" offset="16312642">There were data bases back then that have the principal executive office, the 10-Q reports and the 10-K reports were the same, have the same cover display, and there are data bases that have the State of incorporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.596" offset="16370739">Nothing has changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4059.566" offset="16378680">The choice is the same, and what we are having is an arbitrary rule not originally supported by the parties who are now supporting it, which the Master decided to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4072.555" offset="16430611">There were some questions about the amount of disgorgement in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.149" offset="16452972">Let me say that the disgorgement from New York would be much greater under the rule contended for as the issuer as debtor, because under that rule New York would lose the DTC moneys which are a very big piece of this, and it would lose the money for the New York incorporated banks and the New York incorporated brokers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.962" offset="16544192">There are some of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.365" offset="16549834">We pursued this case originally as a collection case, that this was something which was clearly covered and which New York should not have escheated under the established rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="4112.649" offset="16591003">We do not view it as disgorgement, we view it as collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4116.412" offset="16606050">What you have, I think, if the rules are changed to redefine the issuer as debtor, or to redefine the State of principal executive office, is a... not only a change in the rules which will unsettle expectations and bust the budgets of a number of States, but an unwarranted departure from an area where certainty should be the rule.</text>
