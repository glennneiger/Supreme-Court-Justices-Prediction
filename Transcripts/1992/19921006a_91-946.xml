            <label>Mr. Eric M. Lieberman</label>
            <text syncTime="52.366" offset="349133">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.649" offset="350282">Mr. Justice and may it... Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="57.003" offset="367732">This case raises the question whether compliance with a district court order enforcing an Internal Revenue Service summons renders any subsequent appeal moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.560" offset="413916">The district court below on remand enforced an IRS summons for production of audio tapes held by a disinterested third party record holder, the clerk of the Superior Court of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.202" offset="468460">While the case was on appeal, after the notice of appeal was filed, the clerk of the Superior Court complied with the district court's order and permitted the IRS to inspect and copy the tapes.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.728" offset="526556">Subsequently, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal from the production order as moot without considering or hearing argument on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.019" offset="567725">In doing so, the court of appeals held that once a district court enforces an Internal Revenue Service summons for the production of documents, and once the documents are turned over the IRS by either the taxpayer or by a disinterested third-party record holder, the case becomes moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.664" offset="646302">This rule applies no matter what proprietary, privacy, or other interests the taxpayer may have in the documents and, of course, no matter how meritorious the taxpayer's appeal may be on the merits, even if the taxpayer is claiming privilege, IRS bad faith, or that there is no legitimate, ongoing Internal Revenue Service investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.346" offset="737103">The court of appeals' rule here is contrary to well-established mootness doctrine as enunciated by this Court and by the lower Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.468" offset="773570">Determination of whether a case is moot has long rested on two interrelated considerations: first, the existence of an actual, live controversy between the parties; and second, whether the courts may grant any effectual relief to the prevailing party.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.914" offset="847340">The emphasis here is upon the question of whether any relief may be afforded even if it is only partial relief or relief other than that originally sought at the outset of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="188.321" offset="893002">Well, Mr. Lieberman, I take it all the issues on the merits in this litigation are finished.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.962" offset="935529">They're decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="205.783" offset="962801">First of all, when this Court decided the first Zolin case, it found that in deciding the crime-fraud issue on an attorney-client privilege issue, the district court could look at any evidence not privileged and lawfully obtained by the Government, and it specifically noted that the question of whether the partial transcripts in this case were lawfully obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.785" offset="1074814">It then remanded to the Ninth Circuit, which again declined to reach the issue of whether the transcripts were lawfully obtained, and remanded to the district court for determination of whatever other objections the parties may raise, specifically noting that it was not reaching that particular issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="262.972" offset="1191529">That order is final.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.922" offset="1195395">That's the June 20 order, and that is final.</text>

            <text syncTime="275.012" offset="1239699">We did not seek certiorari on that issue, and the court of appeals did not hold that that issue was precluded from the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.266" offset="1264777">It simply said on this appeal, we are not going to be considering that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.337" offset="1289018">It did not say that the issue had been waived, and it remanded to the district court to consider that issue and any other objections the party might raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.645" offset="1334262">In our petition for certiorari from that particular Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision, the question of whether or not the transcripts had been obtained lawfully, either on the merits or how it was dealt with procedurally, was not even raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.956" offset="1411480">Now, the other issue--</text>

            <text syncTime="320.674" offset="1422347">You didn't even raise it in your original appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.949" offset="1463516">The court of appeals did not preclude us from raising it on the remand that the court of appeals was then ordering to the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.370" offset="1489116">The court of appeals said subject to whatever other issues the parties may raise, and footnoted right at that point, that it is not reaching the issue of unlawfully obtained.</text>

            <text syncTime="362.385" offset="1589217">So, everything in the transcript was covered by the documents themselves, and we've said you can look at the documents themselves in order to determine the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.241" offset="1624639">So it seems to me that that's another reason this case is over no matter what we do.</text>

            <text syncTime="375.245" offset="1640626">--Well, one thing that we were urging below, Your Honor, was that the district court look at the entire tapes because we believe that they would show that the privilege still remained.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.170" offset="1708336">Now, if it's true that it was improper for the court of appeals to look at the partial transcripts, then the whole issue of looking... of what evidence the district court has available to it to look at becomes a live issue, and it must look then, if it is going to look at anything, at the entire case.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.334" offset="1789002">But there is another issue... live issue before the district court as well, which arose even subsequent to the Ninth Circuit's decision, and that issue is whether or not there is at the time of the production order in this case, whether there was a live, ongoing Internal Revenue Service investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.283" offset="1884819">As we showed to the district court, which refused to consider the issue on the merits--</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="1683.458" offset="6873475">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.695" offset="6890507">In the current appeal to the Ninth Circuit that is under review, we argued both that petitioner's claims were res judicata and that the appeal was moot because all of the materials had, in fact, been produced because of the denial of stays and the originals had been returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.910" offset="6995311">The court of appeals did not reach our res judicata contentions, but decided only that the appeal was moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.504" offset="7049750">We argued both that the claims that are being made are claims that have already been resolved against petitioners, and even if some of the claims were not, they could have been raised at the earlier stage, and unlike collateral estoppel, under principles of res judicata, the claims are barred because it's the same litigation between the same parties, and petitioner is not free to raise these claims seriatim rather than all at once.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.339" offset="7169077">But we have not urged the court... we've pointed out this obstacle to petitioner's prevailing, but we have not urged this Court to reach and sort out the res judicata issues which the court of appeals did not reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.135" offset="7232189">We assumed that the Court granted certiorari to decide the question presented in the petition, which was the mootness question on which there is a conflict in the circuits, and that is what we have addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.958" offset="7287464">It's possible that the Court would conclude that the res judicata obstacle to petitioner's prevailing is a reason to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted, but we have not urged that either.</text>

            <text syncTime="1799.702" offset="7338455">I suppose our problem is that if we're going to discuss mootness, we should undertake some analysis of the remedies that might be available below, and in this case, it doesn't look like the petitioner is going to prevail in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.943" offset="7395506">And so, it's just an awkward posture to hear the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1854.732" offset="7558615">And it seems to me that courts have followed two different tracks under virtually identical subpoena statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3555.581" offset="14362050">Mr. Wallace is incorrect in stating that the Government never made copies and never returned copies previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.520" offset="14389740">As we point out on pages 9 to 10 of our reply brief, the Government made seven copies of the tapes and they reduced them to two cassette tapes and a computer disk.</text>
