            <label>Mr. Stuart Jay Filler</label>
            <text syncTime="23.615" offset="219916">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="26.767" offset="232455">This is a statute of limitations case.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.549" offset="243635">Petitioner recognizes that this Court in the Badaracco case decided that a statute of limitations should be strictly construed in favor of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.518" offset="295462">In this case, however, this Court must add phrases to an otherwise clear and unambiguous set of statutory provisions in order to affirm the opinion of the Second Circuit below.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.247" offset="350424">Petitioner believes that this Court did not intend in their prescription in Badaracco to mean that every time there is a statute of limitation issue, the Government wins.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.266" offset="402459">The question presented is whether the three sections of the Internal Revenue Code provide a statute of limitations which bars adjustments to a shareholder's income tax return with respect to items appearing on an S corporation's income tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.008" offset="481454">The three provisions are section 6501(a), section 6037, and section 6012 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended and in effect for 1979, the taxable year at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.993" offset="561388">All three provisions are on page 1 and 2 of petitioner's brief on the merits, if the Court wishes to refer to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.877" offset="592944">It is important to note that Congress in 1958 created an entirely new entity for Federal tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.363" offset="634845">This entity was separate and distinct from its shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.669" offset="656056">The IRS, not Congress, created a form 1120S which is separate and distinct from the form 1040 filed by the shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.066" offset="717705">Congress... the IRS, not Congress, also created a form K-1 and required the corporation to provide the shareholders annually with a form K-1 which reported the bottom line results of the S corporation for the taxable year, and the shareholder was required to attach this form K-1 to the shareholder's form 1040 and report on the shareholder's return the bottom line results of the S corporation for the taxable year.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.142" offset="874022">While examining the shareholder's return, an IRS employee must retrieve the form 1120S, must examine the form 1120S, and must adjust the form 1120S.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.935" offset="945179">Pursuant to section 6501(a) of the code, these adjustments must be made within the 3-year period of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.702" offset="984259">Only then can the IRS adjust the return of the shareholder with respect to the items appearing on the S corporation return.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.969" offset="1037235">If additional time is required for an adjustment to be made, the IRS employee may obtain an extension of the period of limitations for either the S corporation return, the shareholder's return, or both returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.483" offset="1115289">In fact, that is exactly what the Internal Revenue Service did in the case at bar in 1980, the taxable year following the year in dispute in this case, and the 1980 taxable year is not before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.568" offset="1383723">If it was necessary to adjust a C corporation's return, that they would not and could not adjust a C corporation's shareholder's return with respect to the item after the C corporation's period of limitations has expired.</text>

            <text syncTime="1797.542" offset="7315609">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.855" offset="7332850">Under section 6501, the Service has 3 years from the filing of any return to make an assessment of the taxes imposed on that return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.481" offset="7375377">To understand the meaning of this statute, you need to know what an assessment is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.073" offset="7393663">An assessment is merely an administrative record filed in the office of the Secretary of the Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.247" offset="7418427">Based upon the Service's review or audit of the taxpayer's taxable income, the assessment records, as this statute states, the amount of taxes imposed on that income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.835" offset="7464716">Nothing in section 6501 suggests that by limiting the time for recording an assessment, the statute in any manner limits the amount of taxes imposed on the taxable income of the taxpayer by the other provisions of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.138" offset="7529917">I'd like to give you an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.248" offset="7538381">Assume that a corporation files a return claiming a deduction of $10,000 for compensation that it paid to a certain employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.554" offset="7575579">If the corporate return is in error and the employee actually received $50,000 of compensation, nothing in section 6501 would prohibit the Service from making an adjustment to the taxpayer's return to include that $50,000 as his taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.847" offset="7648827">This compensation is taxable income under the code and a tax is imposed on that income under the code even if the corporate return failed accurately to report it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.902" offset="7689055">As the courts held in the Green, Fehlhaber, Bufford, Durovic, and Leonhart cases, the fact that the return of some other entity or person contains an error in reporting the same transaction does not excuse the taxpayer of his duty to properly state his own income on his own return.</text>

            <text syncTime="1939.354" offset="7882779">And the answer to your question is that if that corporation's return period has closed, it cannot be reopened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.636" offset="7899916">We mention in our brief certain mitigation provisions that could apply when... in other circumstances, but those wouldn't apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.441" offset="7935129">This Court reached a similar conclusion in the Bull v. United States case which held that the Commissioner properly could assess an income tax on an item that had been previously, but erroneously reported as an estate tax item on a different return that was no longer open for correction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.326" offset="8018721">The point... the general point is that under 6501 each return starts a period of limitations and the Service is responsible for determining the taxable income and the amount of tax to be imposed on that return regardless of whether the same information is reported incorrectly somewhere else.</text>

            <text syncTime="2068.067" offset="8397705">The Munter case held that the Service could recharacterize income as dividend income even though it had been claimed to be a return of capital by the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.585" offset="8447756">The Service was allowed to adjust the shareholder's return many years after the events had occurred that were the basis of this characterization issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.406" offset="8499060">The events that were the basis of the characterization issue was how the corporation had reported its earnings and profits over the prior decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.271" offset="8534482">So, the fact that the corporation in the Munter case had taken a certain position with respect to its earnings and profits and... did not prevent the Commissioner from restating... from adjusting the shareholder's return properly to state the shareholder's income.</text>

            <text syncTime="2163.400" offset="8778988">Petitioner's argument really misses the point in asserting that section 6501 prevents adjustments to the return of a subchapter S corporation after the time for assessing taxes against the subchapter S corporation has expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.372" offset="8842936">When the Service adjusts a taxpayer's return and assesses tax against the shareholder's income, it is not adjusting the subchapter S corporation return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.507" offset="8883478">The adjustments and the assessment are made on the individual's return, not on the corporation's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.750" offset="8904376">The income involved is the individual's income, not the corporation's, and the tax is imposed on the individual, not on the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.996" offset="8941366">The Second Circuit summarized this issue in the Siben case when they said the return that starts the running of the limitations period is that of the taxpayer whose liability is being assessed and not that of a third person who also reports the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.518" offset="9003433">The subchapter S return is obviously not the return upon which tax can be assessed upon the individual shareholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.022" offset="9037496">The corporate return doesn't contain any of the individualized information or any of the information about other sources of income that are required to assess a tax against the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.720" offset="9084308">In the Automobile Club case in this Court, the Court held that an information return that lacks the data necessary for the calculation and assessment of deficiencies is not a tax return within the contemplation of section 6501.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.380" offset="9150972">In this respect, the subchapter S return is not functionally different from a W-2 return filed by an employer reporting wages under section 6041 of the code or by... or from a form 1099 filed by a bank reporting interest income under section 6049 of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.315" offset="9238639">In all of these situations, the information that has been provided to the Service is relevant to the calculation of the individual's taxes, but none is sufficient to determine the taxpayer's taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.474" offset="9295273">They, therefore, cannot constitute the return that commences the period for assessment of taxes against the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.800" offset="9324634">Turning to section 6037, which deals specifically with S corporations, under that statute the return of the S corporation serves two separate functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.108" offset="9377819">It serves as an information return providing data relevant to the calculation of the shareholder's taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.542" offset="9403524">Indeed, section 6037 is contained within chapter 61, part 3 of the Internal Revenue Code, which is entitled, Information Returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.039" offset="9441558">The return of the subchapter S corporation also serves as the tax return of the S corporation in the narrow circumstances when that corporation is subject to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.995" offset="9485339">As Congress explained in enacting section 6037 in 1958, when the S corporation is itself subject to tax, the return of the S corporation commences the period of limitations for assessment of tax against the shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.586" offset="9547720">Petitioner's suggestion that our interpretation of section 6037, which is simply Congress' interpretation of that statute, somehow renders the statute meaningless simply ignores the legislative history.</text>

            <text syncTime="2524.126" offset="10221888">How far back should I go?</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.906" offset="10228993">I'll start the whole sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.927" offset="10237144">In enacting the unified accounting procedures for large S corporations and large partnerships in 1982 in the statute known as TEFRA, Congress agreed with the case law in stating that under present law the filing by the corporation of its return does not affect the statute of limitations for the individual shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.854" offset="10336827">In a limited category of cases for years after 1982, Congress changed that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.489" offset="10363367">In the ordinary case, however, involving 95 percent of subchapter S corporations that have five or fewer shareholders, Congress retained the preexisting provisions of section 6037.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.238" offset="10418329">Thus, the prior law that Congress described in enacting TEFRA is still the current law for most S corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.106" offset="10453855">And as petitioner recognizes, Congress' description of section 37 is thus authoritative for years after 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.841" offset="10492726">Petitioner conceded that in footnote 47 of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.974" offset="10509339">Giving section 6037 the same meaning before 1982, as it has after 1982, is appropriate, as this Court said in the West Virginia University Hospital case, to make sense rather than nonsense out of the corpus juris.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.726" offset="10584259">Moreover, the interpretation that Congress provided of section 6037, both in 1958 and in 1982, is a reasonable and logical one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.705" offset="10628249">It was made by Congress in performance of its legislative function in enacting intertwining amendments to a complex statutory scheme, and under this Court's decisions in Seatrain Shipbuilding and Red Lion Broadcasting, Congress' views should be given great weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.085" offset="10697735">I should point out that petitioner's contrary interpretation of section 6037 would mean that Congress enacted a nullity when it enacted TEFRA and applied it to the unified statute of limitations provisions for large S corporations after 1982 because, under petitioner's view, the same unified statute of limitations would be reached for all large and small S corporations both before and 1982 if section 6037 had the meaning for which they contend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.688" offset="10840154">Petitioner didn't have time to mention it, but the case that's on his side in this area is the Kelley case decided by the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.464" offset="10879233">And what the Kelley decision held was that it was more fair if the statute of limitations for the shareholder and for the S corporation were coterminus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.802" offset="10924582">The court reasoned that the shareholder may have difficulty obtaining necessary books and records after the period of limitations has expired for assessing taxes against the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.219" offset="10974319">The courts of appeals in the Green, Fehlhaber, and in this case all explain why that concern has no weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.927" offset="11009114">Taxpayers often need information from third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.537" offset="11023534">There's nothing exceptional about that, and indeed, in the context of S corporations, they have even a greater ability to obtain the information that they desire because by definition there are few shareholders, each of whom is likely to have a greater input in the operations of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.180" offset="11098139">In fact, in this case, Mr. Bufferd is the secretary and treasurer of Compo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.625" offset="11123948">He quite obviously had the ability to obtain and retain any records that he wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.078" offset="11145682">And just to gild the lily, the records in this case have no meaning because petitioner conceded from the outset that the deficiencies that the Service found in their return were correct on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.729" offset="11216317">He hasn't contended that the books and records would somehow change that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.523" offset="11231468">In any event, whatever force the concerns expressed in the Kelley case might be, they provide no basis for ignoring the plainly limited language of section 6501 or the clear history of 6037 and its clear provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.355" offset="11302835">By limiting the time for assessing taxes, section 6501 does not limit the amount of taxes to be assessed on a proper accounting of the taxpayer's income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.701" offset="11348184">I would only like to make one other point in response to a question by Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.414" offset="11375037">Justice Blackmun brought up the fact that it is possible, it is conceivable for the Service to obtain extensions from S corporations and thereby avoid this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.544" offset="11435537">While it may be possible and conceivable, the Commissioner has no leverage over S corporations to require them to cooperate and provide an extension for the simple reason that the S corporation has no liability for taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.043" offset="11493529">In the normal case, it is possible to obtain... it is possible that a taxpayer might have an interest in granting an extension because if he doesn't, the Commissioner will then have to assess the highest supportable level of taxes, but there is no such reason or ability to coerce or obtain an agreement from an S corporation because it has no exposure to taxes and the Commissioner has no basis to require it to give an extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.754" offset="11612438">I... since time permits, I'll just take one other second to talk about the suggestion that the legislative history of section 6037 only contains one example and that our position relies upon only that example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.616" offset="11687880">What the history of section 6037 says is that the return of the corporation will constitute the return of the... rather, the return of the corporation will commence the statute running against the corporation when it is not entitled to subchapter S treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.290" offset="11762590">There's more than one reason why a corporation would not be entitled to subchapter S treatment, but in addition, a subchapter S that is entitled not to pay a tax can have that... even in 1958, can have that entitlement terminated if he receives... if that corporation receives too much income from what are called passive sources or from foreign sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.653" offset="11859975">And those provisions are also set out in footnote 17 of petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.888" offset="11884948">Thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="2966.355" offset="11990796">The Second Circuit makes a major... and the respondent... major chronological error by attempting to interpret section 6037 in 1958 as a provision that only applies to a corporation when it is subject to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.628" offset="12063939">In 1958, the subchapter S corporation was not subject to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.570" offset="12083687">It was not until 1966, 8 years afterwards, that a tax was first imposed on an S corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2998.316" offset="12118691">No, but Mr. Filler, he makes the point that it might not have thought it was subject to tax, but it didn't qualify as S corporation status, and therefore you need to limit the period in which a tax might be assessed against it when it made that mistake.</text>

            <text syncTime="3021.612" offset="12211896">The person who prepared the S corporation return might have erroneously thought it was qualified as an S corporation when, in fact, it was not, and the period of making that determination is then set by the statute of limitations.</text>
