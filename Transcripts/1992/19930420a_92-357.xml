            <text syncTime="18.853" offset="219214">As our complaint seeks to make clear, this case poses the basic issue of how far a legislature may go in seeking to guarantee the election to Congress of persons of a particular race.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.329" offset="289118">Perhaps the best evidence is here in the form of the map, which is a reproduction in color of a map which was earlier lodged with the Court at page 133A of the jurisdictional statement in Pope v. Blue, and there are a number of copies of that which I believe are before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.492" offset="381800">We proceed in a sense on the theory that while we are reluctant to use political pornography... and this has been described as political pornography, but really the only way to understand what took place in North Carolina is to look at the evidence thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.187" offset="452540">And our complaint seeks briefly to set forth the history of the developments in our State.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.621" offset="486290">Basically the Attorney General in the summer of 1991 and in the fall made clear that it was necessary to have two majority-minority districts.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robinson O. Everett</label>
            <text syncTime="111.080" offset="588168">He was relying on the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.392" offset="597363">This was apparently an interpretation of the Voting Rights Act which, as we understand some of the recent opinions of the Court, was erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.889" offset="631426">At least that's the way we interpret the Growe case and the Voinovich case.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.012" offset="651906">But in any event, he set forth preconditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.699" offset="662669">Basically, as we allege in the complaint, the precondition for clearing... for preclearing the North Carolina plan was that there be two seats which would be guaranteed for election of African Americans to the Congress of the United States so that here, in a sense, we oppose the issue of legal segregation of the congressional delegation of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.125" offset="760367">Now, North Carolina is a State where the minority population is relatively dispersed.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.904" offset="783459">Indeed, we have also lodged with the Court various data pertaining to the dispersion of the population throughout the 100 counties of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.994" offset="819821">Most of the black population is concentrated in the east and in the Piedmont, that is to say, along the coast and in the center of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.709" offset="866633">Interestingly, there are only five counties in the State and those, with one exception... and that's not a major exception... are relatively small counties, only five counties in which there is a majority of black persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.890" offset="931417">And as a result, after the first plan was submitted to the Attorney General--</text>

            <text syncTime="210.306" offset="985020">And interestingly, those are counties of relatively small population in the northeastern part of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.304" offset="1013023">There's one county which I would say is mid-sized.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.083" offset="1028174">So, as a result of that, the only way basically to achieve this objective of having two majority-minority districts... and indeed, these are super majority-minority districts because it's not 51 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.810" offset="1091077">There's some margin for error, not 65 percent as in the U.J.O. case, but moving up into the mid-50's.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.043" offset="1120021">The only way to achieve that was to violate every one of the principles of redistricting and reapportionment which have heretofore been accepted by the Court, or at least as we understand it, which have been accepted by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.242" offset="1172788">We harken back to Reynolds v. Sims where there was a reference to a pattern of crazy quilts which in and of itself would be sufficient to invalidate the constitutionality of the reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.471" offset="1221689">We harken back to U.J.O. itself where in one of the opinions... I believe it was the opinion of Justice White... there is a reference--</text>

            <text syncTime="1605.383" offset="6565402">This case is about the legal significance of two facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.023" offset="6579926">First, the North Carolina General Assembly intentionally created two majority-minority congressional districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.801" offset="6611064">Second, the General Assembly did so for the purpose of complying with section 5 of the Voting Rights Act and of securing preclearance of its congressional reapportionment plan from the Attorney General of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.156" offset="6660488">In their arguments before the district court and in their briefs to this Court, the plaintiffs' legal contention has been that the first of these allegations, that the State acted intentionally, is an adequate basis on which to make out a constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.852" offset="6719211">The fatal flaw in the plaintiffs' case is that they themselves have affirmatively described what the State's purpose was in so acting, and that purpose was the lawful one of complying with Federal voting rights legislation as interpreted and administered by the responsible Federal official.</text>

            <text syncTime="3170.614" offset="12826326">This Court has upheld in Katzenbach v. South Carolina, the shifting of the burden of proof to the State to demonstrate that its plans are free of racially discriminatory purpose or effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3193.184" offset="12916605">States should be encouraged... far from being a suspect, States should be encouraged to conduct their districting in a way that comes into compliance with the Voting Rights Act, section 2 and section 5, although in this case, the Attorney General's objection letter furnished the State with a pretty firm basis for doubt as to whether it could carry its burden if it chose, for example, the alternative to go to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.800" offset="12999048">The State could legitimately believe it would have trouble carrying its burden of proving an absence of discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.172" offset="13024543">So, clearly the basis for the Attorney General's objection or the State's concern in this case, a fear that the burden could not be carried, was an authorized interpretation by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.966" offset="13063727">The Attorney General is required to object where the State cannot carry its burden in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.464" offset="13085670">So, it is permissible for a State to take into account that it can't carry the shifted burden that this Court sustained in Katzenbach v. South Carolina, and therefore to devise another plan that will meet the Attorney General's concerns or the concern in section 5 of the Voting Rights Act as such that plans be free of racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.423" offset="13181487">We think it is the existence of the Voting Rights Act in this case and Congress' thorough examination of the need for the Voting Rights Act periodically that distinguishes this setting from the cases in which the Court has required strict scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.244" offset="13248778">This Court has recognized that the Voting Rights Act was a drastic remedy in the section 5 preclearance setting, for example, to address the pernicious evil of voting discrimination, and rather than require case-by-case adjudication, Congress determined, and this Court held validly determined, that it was necessary to adopt broader measures to prevent, to hedge against purposeful discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3308.152" offset="13376465">Let me respond first to the last remark by Mr. Kneedler, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.791" offset="13406976">The position seems to be that if the Voting Rights Act authorizes something, then it is automatically valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.644" offset="13462355">And that might be the case in some situations, but we would submit not in the situation that is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.751" offset="13490881">Moreover, it's our contention that the Voting Rights Act did not cause this conduct, that it was done by misinterpretation, and it was done by a misinterpretation on all sides, that the Voting Rights Act leaves the parties free to choose districts other than majority-minority districts, but there's no compulsion, no authorization to have a majority-minority district.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.445" offset="13585653">And our complaint very basically sets forth in its... in the jurisdictional statement that we're complaining of a quota system of a proportional representation which was, in fact, being forced upon the congressional delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.922" offset="13639466">And therefore, the questions that were asked of Mr. Powell are particularly appropriate because that's exactly what it was, to have a quota of a certain number of Members of Congress of a particular race.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.901" offset="13695472">We find no authorization for that in any of the jurisprudence of the Court, and the result of doing that is to--</text>
