            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="135021">We'll hear argument next in Number 108 Original, the State of Nebraska v. the States of Wyoming and Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.679" offset="185699">Mr. Cook, you may proceed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dennis_c_cook" startTime="44.879" stopTime="368.673">
            <label>Mr. Dennis C. Cook</label>
            <text syncTime="44.879" offset="314534">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="49.955" offset="334805">We're here today on exceptions to the Special Master's recommendations on cross motions for partial summary judgment in an original action this Court accepted in 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.532" offset="389140">It was filed in 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.563" offset="397186">What makes this case important to more than the parties before you here today is that these cross motions for summary judgment provide the opportunity for the Court to demonstrate the proper application of summary judgment as a procedural tool to secure a just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of this original case.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.359" offset="492376">To follow the Special Master's recommendations here will be to accept a view of summary judgment that is incompatible with the Court's decision in Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Celotex v. Catrett, and National Wildlife Federation v. Lujan.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.842" offset="570325">The Special Master in this case indicates at the outset of his Second Interim Report that he has followed the Court's dictates with regard to the summary judgment decisions, but I would submit that he hasn't, and the clear example that makes the case is in his resolution of the below Tri-State issue, where the Special Master says:</text>
            <text syncTime="135.761" offset="678054">The specific issue to be addressed at this point is the appropriateness of ruling on whether Nebraska's as-yet-unseen evidence of injury or threatened injury to her interest downstream of Tri-State will be material to whether Wyoming or Colorado has violated Nebraska's apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.743" offset="757989">At this stage, however, it is premature to enter an order advising Nebraska how she may develop her case and the provisions for which her evidence will be deemed material.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.780" offset="802084">Reading the Court's summary judgment decisions, I do not believe that there's a fair reading of those decisions that would allow this recommendation not to decide, but to allow Nebraska more time yet to determine if it has a case, to grope along for another 6 years, possibly, to determine if it has a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.739" offset="913888">That's the heart of our issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.120" offset="927472">Nebraska has brought a petition that alleges four specific violations of the North Platte decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.176" offset="963625">Wyoming has admitted in our answer... we have admitted the four specific actions, but denied that they violate the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.143" offset="1003540">Then by way of summary judgment motions, Wyoming asks the logical and unavoidable legal question of whether those four specific acts do in fact violate the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.542" offset="1061114">Despite what... as complicated as this case may appear from time to time, that legal question is not complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.428" offset="1104686">It involves simply reading the North Platte decree and determining with respect to each of the four issues whether there's a violation of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.397" offset="1152543">The decree was final in 1945, it is a clear and unambiguous statement of what injunctions were imposed against Colorado and Wyoming and Nebraska, and it does not require a trial or further evidence to at least interpret that decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.909" offset="1226626">The analysis of all of the four specific acts follows the same basic course of reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.705" offset="1261839">First, the Court must look at the act and determine within the language of the decree whether in fact that specific act constitutes a violation of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.223" offset="1315860">Then, if it isn't a violation of one of the existing injunctions against Wyoming, then Wyoming is entitled to a summary judgment on that pure question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.823" offset="1370299">Before going further with any one of those specific acts to determine if this Court should exercise its extraordinary power to enjoin the State of Wyoming to prohibit an act, the Court then has to ask the question, has it been asked to amend the decree by Nebraska, has the Court agreed to consider such an amendment of the decree and then, if both of those tests have been met, now, on summary judgment, when Wyoming moves to pierce their pleadings, has Nebraska come forward with evidence that would support a finding in their favor, and that evidence would have to support a finding by clear and convincing evidence that an injunction is necessary to protect some vital interest of the State of Nebraska under the existing decree.</text>

            <text syncTime="402.113" offset="1743432">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.574" offset="1745313">Your Honor, let me turn to the Inland Lakes, at your suggestion, and suggest that Wyoming is entitled to a ruling in its favor on summary judgment, and our initial summary judgment motion was that it is not a violation of the degree for Wyoming not to recognize an interstate water right for the Inland Lakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.911" offset="1850639">The point that we would make is that there is no interstate water right in the decree, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.727" offset="1881881">The Supreme Court in 1945... and I would turn to paragraph IV of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.551" offset="1913124">That's found at Appendix A-4 of our brief... knew how to specify an interstate water right.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.617" offset="1945411">The entire North Platte case that spanned 11 years from 1934 to 1945 was about a request to enforce interstate water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.266" offset="1995984">That was to have the State of Wyoming and the State of Wyoming... or, State of Wyoming, pardon me, and the State of Colorado forced by this Court to exercise their police power against valid rights in those States for the benefit of a right in Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.544" offset="2061186">No one asked for an interstate water right for the Inland Lakes, and when you look at paragraph IV, where there's very careful specification of the interstate water right for five specific canals, where Wyoming was required to exercise its police power to prohibit the... or to interfere with the operation of valid Wyoming water rights for the benefit of these Nebraska rights, the Court was clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.433" offset="2168706">They did not issue a water right then for the Inland Lakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.885" offset="2186469">They were not asked to issue one, and there was no predicate State water right for which they could base one.</text>

            <text syncTime="520.770" offset="2218025">The Master's alternate ground for granting summary judgment for Nebraska on the Inland Lakes I think was that there had been a longstanding acquiescence by Wyoming.</text>

            <text syncTime="535.371" offset="2276435">We disagree, Your Honor.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="536.582" offset="2281346">Yes, I would expect you would.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dennis_c_cook" startTime="538.243" stopTime="769.054">
            <label>Mr. Dennis C. Cook</label>
            <text syncTime="538.243" offset="2287929">What has occurred over time is that the Inland Lakes have stored water from the North Platte River, but since 1913, the record that we've supplied through our affidavits on summary judgment is that Wyoming has put the United States on notice since 1913 that they had no valid water right, and to the extent that they took water, they had no right to expect priority administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.411" offset="2400569">They were taking free river water at their peril.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.703" offset="2417810">In other words, they can continue to do that, and we will allow that practice to continue now, but the problem is, is the Special Master would recommend that a 1904 priority be imposed that works a mischief on many Wyoming water rights obtained according to Wyoming water law, including the Cities of Casper and most of the major users on the North Platte.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.040" offset="2523135">Further, I would just suggest that because it's not in the decree, that resolves the issue completely, and there is no interstate water right.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.020" offset="2575067">Should the Court consider whether they would like to amend the decree, that becomes, then, a question of fact, whether that amendment is necessary to protect those interests in Nebraska that are protected by the decree, and the decree clearly protects irrigation water rights that divert between Whalen and Tri-State Diversion Dam, nothing else... nothing further downstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.885" offset="2670466">If I might, Your Honor, I'll turn to the Deer Creek issue, to give some thought to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.690" offset="2701708">On the Deer Creek project, clearly even the Special Master agrees that there is no current restriction that prohibits Wyoming from constructing the Deer Creek project.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.349" offset="2752386">The issue becomes whether the Court has agreed to accept an amendment of the decree, and hear a case to amend the decree to prohibit Wyoming from constructing the Deer Creek project.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.647" offset="2801601">Whether the courts accepted it, or whether the State of Nebraska made the proper threshold showing allowing them to get into court on that separate issue, becomes irrelevant when you look at the fact that now it apparently is here in front of the Special Master on summary judgment Nebraska has come forward with no facts that under your cases on summary judgment would support them prevailing at trial if that was the only evidence presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.191" offset="2943707">Special Master Olpin in this case narrowed the issue down to the record of two specific affidavits of Mr. Lee Becker, an expert employed by the State of Nebraska, former Nebraska State hydrologist, and those two... I'd point the Court's attention to that in their consideration of this case to review those two affidavits and determine if they could enter judgment on behalf of Nebraska based on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.571" offset="3073274">Mr. Becker specifically told... in his March 1 affidavit indicated that, after analyzing the Deer Creek project, its effect on the North Platte River, he even analyzed the impact of a junior water right on the Inland Lakes, and he analyzed the impact of no flows from the Laramie reaching the North Platte, he concluded that historic diversions from Whalen to Tri-State Diversion Dam can be met in all scenarios described.</text>

            <label>Ms. Gale Norton</label>
            <text syncTime="1119.440" offset="4612722">That's correct, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.983" offset="4618887">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.516" offset="4632993">The State of Colorado is today involved only in the issue of claims of Nebraska for water below Tri-State Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.352" offset="4668415">For us, it is a very important issue, because it determines not just the scope of issues to be tried in this case, but whether Colorado is involved in this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.529" offset="4713137">The case is essentially an allegation by Nebraska of decree violations by Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.433" offset="4740722">There is absolutely no allegation that Colorado has in any way violated the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.156" offset="4763605">Tri-State Dam is essentially on the Nebraska-Wyoming State line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.241" offset="4791922">The area below Tri-State Dam was tried in the original 1945 decision, and in that case the Court found, after there had been litigation, that the area below Tri-State Dam was adequately served by local supplies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.935" offset="4874678">Those were return flows from irrigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.528" offset="4889098">Those included the rain that fell in that area, but local supplies were adequate without any call on the upstream Wyoming and Colorado share of the river to preserve the irrigation within the Nebraska areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.928" offset="4958688">Downstream, or upstream from Tri-State, Nebraska has large rights in the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.242" offset="4987945">It derives water from storage rights, from reservoirs that have been built upstream for the benefit of Nebraska, and it also has specifically allocated to it within the decree various canals and the ability to draw water from those canals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.814" offset="5054192">What Nebraska seeks in this case is apparently the ability to go beyond what has been decreed to it and to introduce evidence about various equities that have developed, equities developing from the fact that it has had excess water beyond the limited amount that it is given in the decree, and that because of that extra benefit it has had through the years, it has developed equities in reliance on that excess water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.731" offset="5165891">Essentially what Nebraska is trying to do is to circumvent the limited nature of the enforcement action in which the Special Master is currently involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.990" offset="5214897">This Court agreed to hear the case essentially as an enforcement action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.673" offset="5237676">Twice, Nebraska has attempted to modify its petition in order to expand and to allow amendment and modification of the decree itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.882" offset="5286472">The first time this Court denied outright that attempt to expand the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.366" offset="5312386">The second attempt is still pending before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.500" offset="5329000">Nebraska's approach drastically changes the nature of this action from determining whether simply the four specified violations by Wyoming are, indeed, violations of the compact, to a complex trial, including a trial on the equities of current usage and on the issues of the need for water for endangered species.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.126" offset="5431504">This, certainly for Colorado, presents the potential of a reshuffling of the equities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.640" offset="5457522">We have settled equities from the 1945 decision, and we are very concerned about any attempt to reopen those equities and to reweigh those equities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1404.601" offset="5753333">All of these issues are currently being considered in an Endangered Species proceeding on Lake McConahay.</text>

            <text syncTime="1420.201" offset="5815818">There's certainly no reason in this enforcement action to open up the decree to consideration of new issues like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.348" offset="5860330">Essentially what we ask this Court is to keep in mind that the analysis should be a backward-looking interpretation of the decree itself.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Simms</label>
            <text syncTime="1634.932" offset="6674724">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.467" offset="6704817">Colorado has just described to you the so-called Tri-State issues solely in the context of Nebraska's petition, and I would submit to you they have absolutely nothing to do with Nebraska's petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.477" offset="6760928">They relate entirely to Wyoming's counterclaim, which is not before you on exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.389" offset="6784543">With respect to these Tri-State issues, it is imperative that you know what Wyoming and Colorado are truly after.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.445" offset="6812755">They are truly not seeking to define the apportionment, as they have told you, but rather to preclude the presentation of evidence underlying one of Nebraska's principal defenses to Wyoming's counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.084" offset="6875344">When the equities were evaluated in 1945 in this case, one of the factors that was considered, one of the most important factors that was considered by the Court, was return flows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.024" offset="6935112">That is, flows that go from upgradient lands after the primary use and can be utilized again on downgradient lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.600" offset="6973356">At the close of the evidence, Nebraska conceded that she needed no apportionment of direct flows east of Bridgeport, Nebraska... that's about 60 miles into Bridgeport... but she still maintained that she needed an apportionment of direct flows for the lands between Tri-State, just below the State line, and Bridgeport, some 60 miles in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.908" offset="7078577">The... Master Doherty found, in dealing with this problem, that there did not be an apportionment of direct flows because the canals below Tri-State, lying below Tri-State and between Tri-State and Bridgeport, could be satisfied by return flows, and what he did was to stop the direct apportionment at Tri-State with the understanding that, as an intrinsic part of that apportionment, the canals below Tri-State and above Bridgeport would be satisfied by the return flows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.799" offset="7270211">There are ten canals in that area now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.912" offset="7282645">Their sole source of supply... that is, their sole source of natural flow... comes from those return flows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.726" offset="7309917">There are no tributaries in the reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.939" offset="7322770">They have no alternative means of obtaining water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.289" offset="7336144">The definition that the State of Wyoming wants from the Court is this: they want you to declare that, quote, evidence of uses supplied by diversions below Tri-State Dam is immaterial to proof of Nebraska's apportionment under the decree, end quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.162" offset="7419632">Well, Wyoming's purpose in seeking that definition is simply to enable it to pursue its counterclaim without respecting the indirect apportionment to the canals below Tri-State and above Bridgeport.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.527" offset="7497059">In 1945, these canals were called the optional diverters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.899" offset="7514613">Now, if New Mexico... or, if Nebraska's evidence could be precluded, eliminating Nebraska's obligation to protect parens patriae all of those users relying on return flows, Wyoming could then freely pursue her counterclaim to attempt to force on the primary users of waters diverted at Tri-State increased efficiencies, and they would do so pursuant to the Court's first decision in 1980, I believe, in Colorado v. New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.333" offset="7660272">Without going through the numbers, if you were to increase the efficiency of the primary users by 15 percent, you would reduce the return flows by 50 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.163" offset="7719622">That would leave the ten canals in that stretch without the source of water that was provided to them by Master Doherty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2023.587" offset="8229323">I believe, Justice Scalia, what it proves is what the United States urged upon Master Doherty in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.185" offset="8263700">They urged this alternative for these optional diverters of not providing them with a direct flow apportionment at Tri-State, and the alternative was, we can provide them with return flows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.184" offset="8323677">That is their sole source.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.656" offset="8329633">We need to be able to establish that as a factual matter in order to protect those users parens patriae, and all of that is embraced within the apportionment in paragraph V.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.616" offset="8389401">I'd like to get on to the Deer Creek matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.188" offset="8411762">With respect to Deer Creek, the Special Master left open the possibility of avoiding trial in giving Wyoming an unconstitu... or, an unconditional license to deplete the irrigation apportionment if the proposed Deer Creek project fell within Master Olpin's construction of paragraph X.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.327" offset="8512281">Paragraph X in the decree states that the decree shall not affect or restrict municipal uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.732" offset="8545927">Reading an affirmative grant into paragraph X, contrary to the plain language of that paragraph, Mr. Olpin has construed paragraph X as giving municipalities a right to deplete the flows that were apportioned for irrigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.914" offset="8618652">Instead of reading paragraph X as ensuring that the apportionment provisions would not restrict municipal uses, as it says quite plainly, he reads paragraph X to say that municipalities can restrict the apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.705" offset="8685839">What he has done, in effect, is to redefine paragraph X to infer an affirmative right as a result of the paragraph's elimination of restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.094" offset="8735367">Doherty's... Master Doherty's explanation of that paragraph in 1944 I think conclusively establishes that Master Olpin is wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="2198.473" offset="8928882">Now, if Wyoming takes water that was apportioned to it for municipal... it takes water out of its 25 percent, or whatever it is, and uses it for municipal purposes, does that still count toward the 25 percent that was apportioned to Wyoming?</text>

            <text syncTime="2224.620" offset="9033477">What we are saying is that the paragraph itself plainly said and was meant to remove any possible restriction on municipalities by the operation of the coercive aspects of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.673" offset="9101708">Master Doherty, when he made his recommendation to the Court for the decree provisions, said, and I'm quoting, the parties are agreed that there should be no restriction upon the diversion from the North Platte River in Colorado or Wyoming of water for ordinary and usual domestic and municipal purposes and consumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.548" offset="9193137">Nothing in the injunctions recommended is intended to or will interfere with such uses, diversions and uses, end quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.274" offset="9232112">By reference to the injunctions, Master Doherty I believe was explaining what was meant a little bit more specifically, and what he was explaining was that the coercive parts of the decree should not affect municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.584" offset="9297313">He was not indicating in the slightest manner that paragraph X somehow gave an affirmative right to deplete the apportionment for irrigation purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2468.261" offset="10008053">It would do that by virtue of the way in which the water in the different reservoirs accrued to accounts as opposed to physically accruing to the reservoirs, and it's a very complicated explanation, but nevertheless the evidence, both of the United States and Nebraska's evidence, establishes that beyond a doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.015" offset="10094988">With respect to the Laramie River, the question may simply be one of semantics.</text>

            <text syncTime="2555.700" offset="10357780">The Special Master has recommended a proper disposition of the pending motions for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.352" offset="10380350">He has skillfully articulated the issues in this complicated, ongoing case, and I would like to address those issues in the same order that he chose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.817" offset="10414205">I turn first to the Master's recommendation with respect to the Inland Lakes which directly affects the United States' responsibilities under the reclamation laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.453" offset="10448791">The Master has correctly concluded that the Bureau of Reclamation is entitled to continue its 80-year-old practice of diverting water to the Inland Lakes during the nonirrigation season to meet the needs of the North Platte project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.763" offset="10506051">Wyoming's challenge to that practice is flawed in four fundamental respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.945" offset="10526740">First, the Bureau does have a State water permit with a 1904 priority date to divert water for the North Platte project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.461" offset="10556833">The Inland Lakes are an essential component of the North Platte project and are therefore embraced within that permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.515" offset="10581075">Second, the Inland Lake diversions that are at issue here have occurred continuously since the commencement of the North Platte project operations in 1913.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.722" offset="10625901">If Wyoming truly believed that the Federal Government's diversions were unlawful, it should have raised its objections at that time, or at the latest, at the outset of the proceedings in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2728.143" offset="11047517">Yes, in fact the Special Master notes that at page 25 of his report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.724" offset="11061832">In 1934, the engineer for the State of Wyoming did note that if the Inland Lakes are a part of the project, then in fact they would be covered by that permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.060" offset="11103210">Now, the third point that I'd like to make with respect to this is that the Bureau's Inland Lakes diversions were specifically considered in the 1934 proceedings, and are, in the Special Master's words, a vital underpinning of the apportionment that was ultimately made.</text>

            <text syncTime="2782.438" offset="11264752">I think it's important to recognize that all the decree does is implement the Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.571" offset="11285232">The Court's decision in 1945 is long and complex, and it's an extraordinary matter, as Mr. Cook has stated, to enjoin a State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.308" offset="11324206">The decree only imposed injunctions where it felt it was necessary to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.750" offset="11341970">Nevertheless, the decree is founded upon those assumptions and those decisions that are contained in the Court's decision, and an important part of those decisions was this wintertime diversion to the Inland Lakes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2826.176" offset="11439668">All Article IV of the decree is concerned with doing is determining the relationship between certain senior Nebraska canals, so-called State line canals and the French Canal, and the irrigation reservoirs of the Bureau of Reclamation, and what paragraph IV essentially says is you have to fill... you have to supply water to these canals at a certain rate before you can begin to fill the reservoirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.421" offset="11532663">Now, it's not clear from reading the decree that that's what it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.513" offset="11544993">You have to go back and read the opinion again to understand this, but that is the actual operational purpose of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.649" offset="11581565">Now, the fourth point that I would like to make is that as the Special Master recognized, the result Wyoming advocates here will impair the Bureau's ability to fulfill its water delivery contracts and will upset settled expectations on the North Platte River.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.200" offset="11647811">This manner of operation has been in effect for a long, long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.872" offset="11662440">Likewise, our temporary storage in Guernsey and Glendo to effectuate this apportionment has been in place for a good number of years as well, and that is simply an operational practice of the Bureau, and I think it's beyond challenge by Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.822" offset="11714267">Now, the Special Master also refused to grant summary judgment on three other issues on this case, concluding that the issues were not yet ripe for resolution, or that they involved disputed issues of material fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.069" offset="11767243">The Special Master's recommendations on those interlocutory matters should be respected, particularly in light of his familiarity with the record of this case, a record that is still being developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.416" offset="11812592">Specifically, the Special Master correctly recommended that this Court should deny summary judgment motions with respect to the Laramie River's contributions to the North Platte.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.473" offset="11852820">There are two critical considerations with respect to this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.337" offset="11876330">First, Wyoming's argument that this matter is controlled by the Laramie decree is untenable, because that decree only apportions flow down to the Wheatland project on the Laramie River.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.874" offset="11914469">Post-Wheatland accretions continue to flow into the North Platte River, so that decree does not control matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="3450.004" offset="13934988">Finally, Special Master Olpin was also correct in rejecting Wyoming's argument that Special Master Doherty's determination of canal requirements in the 1934 proceedings imposed limits on the water that could be diverted to the various canals.</text>
