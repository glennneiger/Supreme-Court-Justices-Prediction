            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="142859">We'll hear argument now in No. 91-1043, the Professional Real Estate Investors v. Columbia Pictures Industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.689" offset="185595">Mr. Coyne.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="patrick_j_coyne" startTime="12.105" stopTime="134.551">
            <label>Mr. Patrick J. Coyne</label>
            <text syncTime="12.105" offset="191238">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.807" offset="202000">This Court has held repeatedly that use of the litigation process as an anticompetitive weapon, as opposed to use of the outcome of that process, violates the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.949" offset="254559">The question today is whether in drawing the line between legitimate and illegitimate uses of the judicial process a court can refuse to consider highly relevant evidence of intent under the Ninth Circuit's baselessness standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.743" offset="325821">Even a memorandum in a party's files admitting that the only reason a case was brought was to drive a competitor out of the market through the cost of the litigation process, regardless of the outcome, would not be admissable or even discoverable.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.138" offset="395411">I would like to establish today three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.007" offset="406800">First, predatory litigation, that is, a suit that is brought to burden, to harass, to intimidate, to impose costs upon a competitor regardless of the outcome of the judicial process, violates the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.385" offset="476390">Second, the Ninth Circuit's baselessness test strips these important antitrust concerns of any realistic level of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.824" offset="514111">A case can be more than baseless, yet still use the judicial process improperly to harm competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.365" offset="552250">The Ninth Circuit standard would immunize these predatory cases in spite of the antitrust injury they cause and in spite of the absence of any genuine intent to petition the courts for redress of grievances under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.291" offset="615989">Third, an inquiry into subjective intent is workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.778" offset="637932">It also does not chill the exercise of genuine First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.848" offset="658203">Even rule 11 allows an inquiry into subjective intent of the litigant.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>

            <label>Mr. Patrick J. Coyne</label>
            <text syncTime="139.555" offset="701043">Chief Justice, it's the intent to use the process itself to harm competition as distinct from the intent to achieve a judicial outcome as an anticompetitive tool.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="148.661" stopTime="160.349">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="148.661" offset="737406">And do you think... what about a mixed motive case where you're rummaging through a corporation's files?</text>
            <text syncTime="155.397" offset="764364">You come across one thing that says maybe this and another thing that says maybe that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Patrick J. Coyne</label>
            <text syncTime="160.349" offset="784217">Virtually every case is going to be a case of mixed motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.003" offset="798846">If we begin in a summary judgment setting such as this with the premise that there is an anticompetitive intent, as we have to in this case, then the predator is going to accept the kill.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.728" offset="845762">They will not turn it away.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.028" offset="850882">So, there's going to always be a willingness to accept a positive judicial result.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.730" offset="869690">What the trier of fact has to do is consider all of the evidence of intent and reach a finding on whether it was motivated by an attempt to abuse the process as opposed to achieve the outcome.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="192.721" offset="913680">And that's the end of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.321" offset="916083">Is that... one way or another, whether the case is baseless or not or whatever the outcome, intent is the sole and only determiner.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="patrick_j_coyne" startTime="203.928" stopTime="238.832">

            <text syncTime="204.845" offset="962163">We don't believe that intent is the sole determinant.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.563" offset="973030">There are a number of factors this Court has looked at over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.765" offset="989853">In Allied Tube it identified the context, the source, the nature of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.002" offset="1014826">In California Motor Transport, it looked directly at the intent with which it's brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.239" offset="1035724">It also looked at the use of misrepresentations, unethical means before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.227" offset="1055682">We would suggest that the Court direct the lower courts to look at all five factors, but on the element of intent, the issue is intent as to the means versus intent as to the outcome.</text>

          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="238.832" stopTime="241.700">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="238.832" offset="1098105">Well, when you look at all the factors, what are you trying to decide?</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="249.640" offset="1141363">So, you say that intent in the end is the determining factor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1623.289" offset="6635959">--because it's resting its decision on statutory interpretation grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.507" offset="6656857">In... and in construing this particular statute, the Court has broader latitude than it does in the typical statutory interpretation case because when Congress enacted the Sherman Act, it gave the courts broad responsibility for giving content to the statute's broad mandate by formulating rules of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.368" offset="6724253">So, we think the appropriate methodology here is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.737" offset="6733762">The Court should weigh the costs and the benefits of the contending rules and select the one that best reconciles the general goals of the Sherman Act with the particular purposes of Noerr immunity, and we think that the court of appeals did just that and that its rule is the appropriate one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.914" offset="6790500">Now, Mr. Coyne has said something about the benefits of petitioners' approach in terms of the supposed enhancement of antitrust enforcement, and it certainly is possible to hypothesize examples of conduct that would be captured by petitioners' rule, but would be exempt from antitrust liability under the standard adopted by the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.660" offset="6873465">But we think that Justice Stevens' remark about probability hit the nail on the head.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.112" offset="6891228">In considering what weight to give to these hypothetical possibilities, it's important to recognize just how unlikely the conduct that petitioners have hypothesized is in the real world.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.818" offset="6930098">What is required is a lawsuit that petitioners could win but have no interest in winning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.122" offset="6951310">Certainly the overwhelming majority of lawsuits that a plaintiff can win are prosecuted at least in part to achieve that goal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1744.197" offset="7119643">The question that the Court was getting at in Noerr and that the Court was also getting at in California Motor Transport was an intent not to gain a benefit through victory in the governmental forum, but to impose costs through the process of that forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.889" offset="7182337">So, the question, it seems to us, should be the same, and Noerr and City of Columbia made clear that mixed motive cases are cases that are protected.</text>

            <text syncTime="3015.794" offset="12205997">And what it basically says is that in deciding what the actual subjective intent of the antitrust defendant is, weight should be given to objective factors, which I don't think is a very surprising conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.519" offset="12252913">But at the end of the day, the Government would have intent be the only question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3047.146" offset="12331385">I don't think so, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.996" offset="12334833">I think they think, for example, in this case the pleading was not sufficient to entitle petitioners to discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.066" offset="12359075">But I think the way it works out for the Government is that there are presumptions that guide the fact finder in determining intent and that those presumptions may also in some cases prevent discovery where all the objective evidence is on the antisham side of the ledger, that it may be very difficult for an antitrust plaintiff to obtain discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.948" offset="12454578">But they rely on the regular apparatus for controlling discovery, and we think that's a very, very uncertain protection for people who are ex ante deciding whether or not to engage in this protected conduct and weighing the potential burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.624" offset="12517272">You just can't know what's going to happen down the line, whether the district judge is going to cut off discovery or not cut off discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.926" offset="12538483">It's extremely uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.111" offset="12543290">And we think that really does not provide the sufficient protection as the Court concluded in Harlow and, as I should say, the common law has made clear because the common law analogs, if you will, to this question both require objective indicia before there can be inquiry into subjective intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.037" offset="12606924">Both malicious prosecution and abuse of process require an objective showing for precisely this reason, in order to prevent chilling of misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.261" offset="12655826">Let me just conclude in answering the question about the Government's position that we think their... the problem is, as I say, their entirely subjective inquiry doesn't provide the protection that a dual objective-subjective inquiry does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.020" offset="12722908">And that's the problem with the rule that they've adopted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3169.063" offset="12819039">We did a survey of the cases, and petitioners haven't taken issue with it, that if one looks at the cases in which a sham has been found, even in circuits that have an entirely subjective test, there is invariably objective misconduct accompanying it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.573" offset="12877135">So, we don't think that the court of appeals standard is going to cut off or give some immunity to misconduct that's occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.345" offset="12908168">I think that's a red herring in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.486" offset="12960727">Let me conclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.336" offset="12964175">Let me just mention one other thing about the Government's approach because petitioners have argued that they like the Government's subjective test, but they're entitled to discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.592" offset="12997194">And if that's true, I think that reveals a considerable flaw in the Government's standard because if in this case, where there are no objective indicia of anything but a properly prosecuted lawsuit... if in this case they're entitled to discovery, then the Government's protection is not going to be much protection because in every case they're going to be entitled to discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.022" offset="13078905">The jury is going to make this very, very murky intent determination, and we're going to have very, very substantial chilling of legitimate... the filing of legitimate lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.211" offset="13115685">And that's exactly what Noerr was designed to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.830" offset="13130105">Unless the Court has any further questions, thank you.</text>
