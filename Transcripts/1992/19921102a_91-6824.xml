            <text syncTime="152.364" offset="731826">The opinion of the court of appeals improperly relies upon civil law for its rationale using the analogy of interpleader and using the analogy of joint tort cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.676" offset="809044">In doing this, it fails to distinguish the fundamental differences between a civil trial and a criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.649" offset="857005">And as this Court is aware, in a criminal case the defendant by law is presumed to be innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.537" offset="884486">The burden never shifts to the defendant, and the burden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.643" offset="908937">In failing to distinguish between the civil case and the criminal case, there is a serious risk that a joint trial would confuse the jury and prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about the guilt or innocence of one or more of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.072" offset="994723">When co-defendants attack each other and attack each other's defenses before the jury, they blur together as one, and as a result, both defendants are likely to be convicted because neither defense is believed.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.386" offset="1075911">In their antagonism, each lawyer becomes the government's champion against the other co-defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.826" offset="1109662">The resulting struggle makes each of the defendants vulnerable, as courts have held, to the insinuation that it's a conspiracy that would explain the conflict.</text>

            <text syncTime="260.983" offset="1166295">I suppose another one is that if you try them separately and they are both lying, each one will be acquitted, the other one being absent and declining to testify because he might tend to incriminate himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.530" offset="1248529">But again, in a criminal case it's not up to the defendant to have to prove his innocence, and this court decision actually results in a shifting of the burden of proof from the Government to the defendant because when the defendant gets up, he then not only has the burden of proving that he himself is telling the truth, he also must convince the jury that the co-defendant is lying.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.107" offset="1414772">If his co-defendant who has pled guilty or been found guilty who is testifying, in that situation the co-defendant says I'm guilty and my accomplice was the defendant on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.716" offset="1469211">It's different than in a situation where a defendant is on trial saying I am innocent, but it's the co-defendant who is really guilty, and for my defense to be believed, the co-defendant must be found guilty.</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. Manning</label>
            <text syncTime="1503.554" offset="6136561">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.208" offset="6159235">We have three points here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.076" offset="6170729">First, the motion for severance is typically made at the beginning of trial and then renewed again throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.532" offset="6216496">That was what occurred in this case, and that is a fairly standard practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.920" offset="6230080">This Court has made clear that the obligation under rule 14 to consider the question of severance is a continuing obligation on the trial court throughout trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.441" offset="6268114">The difficulty, however, is that when defendants file a motion for severance at the outset, it is very difficult to tell how the trial is to proceed, and the better practice for the district court is to wait the development of the trial and see if there is, in fact, prejudice from any source before it renders the decision to severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.939" offset="6354109">In this case, for example, on... in the joint appendix on page 101, for example, the attorney for Salvador Garcia indicated that Mr. Garcia would testify that the box of cocaine was Soto's and not his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.364" offset="6407817">Mr. Garcia did not testify at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.900" offset="6417952">There's a great incentive in filing a pretrial motion for severance to indicate that there are matters that will result in prejudice to the defendants even if those don't eventuate at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.708" offset="6469257">So, any broad rule under rule 14... broad application of rule 14 will likely result in the reversal of trials at the conclusion of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.564" offset="6504679">But more--</text>

            <text syncTime="1610.157" offset="6562984">He does also say that he will testify, but he did in fact testify at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.791" offset="6581583">More fundamentally than the practical point, however, we have a basic difference with the petitioners on what it means to be tried in a case with a defendant presenting an inconsistent defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.035" offset="6630484">Our view is not that presentation of inconsistent defenses will blur the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.189" offset="6655144">Rather, it is our view that, consistent with the premises of our system of justice, the truth is more likely to be learned when there are powerful statements on both sides of a difference of opinion about factual disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.430" offset="6708120">Soto and Garcia, as you know, were both carrying 55 pounds of cocaine up a stairwell when they were caught by police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.785" offset="6737482">Each of them naturally claimed at trial that the box of cocaine belonged to the other and that he didn't know what was inside of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.606" offset="6764858">If each of them had a different account of events with which both were familiar, then the jury's understanding was inevitably sharpened and not dulled as each tried to show through evidence, cross-examination, and closing argument that his story was true, and his co-defendant's--</text>

            <text syncTime="1699.447" offset="6920130">And I would want to point out one thing, that this is the interpretation of a rule and the fact that 11 out of 12 circuits have viewed it a certain way does not mean that the interpretation is correct, particularly when you consider the fact that most of the circuits have articulated standards which varied from one another somewhat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.895" offset="7001946">There... a representative sample is cited in our brief at footnote 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.347" offset="7019813">But typically the way that this issue arises in a court of appeals case is that the court of appeals will articulate one or the other of the varying standards as boiler plate en route to holding that the district court did not abuse its broad discretion in determining not to sever a trial for antagonistic defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.510" offset="7100480">The court will typically find that there's some reason that the defense is not antagonistic, for example, a defense--</text>

            <text syncTime="1792.074" offset="7290651">Typically the case is like this one where it is perfectly plain that at least one of the two defendants... or two or more defendants has some guilt for the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="1807.786" offset="7353554">I mean, typically there are cases where you have an uncle and his nephew sitting on the front seat of a car with a shotgun, and the police come and they find the shotgun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.641" offset="7388976">And the nephew and the uncle say, look, it's... these are antagonistic defenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1822.362" offset="7411859">And in fact, they will be disadvantaged by being tried together because the jury will get a full picture of the case, and if they've tried to shift blame onto each other, the two defendants, then--</text>

            <text syncTime="1839.388" offset="7479986">He, in effect, said if I am tried separately, I will get on the stand and say Soto knew all about it and I knew nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.144" offset="7506945">But they're tried together and he apparently elected not to point the finger at his co-defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.262" offset="7527425">Now, there could be cases... I don't know if there are or not... in which there is, in fact, an innocent person out with his uncle or something like that who, if tried separately, would tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, but would be unwilling to get on the stand in a courtroom with his accomplice and accuse somebody who's a member of his family or somebody he's very close to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.092" offset="7602762">So, it's conceivable that the antagonistic defense would actually prevent somebody from testifying who would otherwise testify.</text>

            <text syncTime="2291.249" offset="9287346">But in each of the cases... and Mr. Justice Stevens, I suggest the reason there probably is no scholarly work in this area is because the reason is because up until this particular case, there was no need for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.741" offset="9333322">It was uniformly accepted that the prejudice is so inherent, if you have an antagonistic defense presented by a co-defendant, that the defendant cannot receive a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.381" offset="9379924">And I would suggest respectfully that's the reason that each of the circuits that considered this question said that a co-defendant is entitled to a severance if an antagonistic defense is presented by a co-defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.741" offset="9441364">Counsel for the Government said that the fact that Zafiro was acquitted of the substantive count of possession with intent to distribute shows that the jury followed the instructions, and I would suggest respectfully a review of the record shows that if she's found guilty of conspiracy of possession with intent to distribute, the facts in the case showed she also should have been convicted of possession with intent to distribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.593" offset="9552751">And I would suggest that the reason for the distinction is the jury was confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.712" offset="9569260">And the difficulty is that the two defenses were always blurred together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.183" offset="9587128">And when the defendants become each other's prosecutor, the jury is likely to be confused, and the result is there's going to be a substantial likelihood that both will be convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.824" offset="9637701">And I would suggest that's the reason why each circuit that considered this question came up with a uniform rule of law.</text>
