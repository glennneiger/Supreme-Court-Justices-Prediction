            <label>Ms. Margaret P. Griffey</label>
            <text syncTime="1849.574" offset="7538057">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.514" offset="7573792">Post trial consideration of newly asserted evidence relevant to guilt and the reassessment of the likelihood of guilt based on such evidence by a reviewing court is not required by the Constitution, nor can authority for such review be derived from the Constitution under existing constitutional analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.825" offset="7642964">The trial is the constitutionally designated procedure for the determination of guilt and the executive clemency is the mechanism envisioned by the drafters of the Federal Constitution and the constitutions of the 50 states to correct an unjust conviction or to prevent the imposition of an apparently unjust sentence when that conviction or sentence cannot be corrected by existing standards or procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.591" offset="7738050">The rule proposed by Herrera would require reviewing court to reassess the likelihood of guilt whenever a defendant asserts additional evidence after trial in an attempt to establish a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.149" offset="7784339">Such a rule would transform the trial into but a preliminary determination of guilt, it would encourage sand bagging of available evidence in defenses, and in the capital context would require a reviewing court to enter repeated stays of execution to consider a defendant's untimely assertions of newly discovered evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.026" offset="7855810">Such post trial reassessment of the likelihood of guilt would be inherently less reliable than the trial process itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.114" offset="7884127">It would require a reviewing court to weigh unreliable, motivated evidence advanced years after trial by the defendant against the cold trial record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.553" offset="7921952">As this Court has recognized, an alibi defense can easily be fabricated and a defense witness who is not identified until the eleventh hour is inherently suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.843" offset="7963121">As a practical matter a defendant's actual innocence could only under the most unusual circumstances be characterized as newly discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.033" offset="7995826">A defendant normally knows whether he committed the crime or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.068" offset="8012022">Where, as is true in Herrera's case, a defendant fails to offer any defense at trial but simply puts the state to his proof, the assertion immediately prior to his scheduled execution date of a claim of actual innocence based on newly asserted evidence must be presumptively unreliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.547" offset="8081926">Herrera's case demonstrates both the inappropriateness of a reviewing court's relitigating guilt and the potential for abuse is inherent in constitutionalizing such a procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.985" offset="8123617">Herrera's newly asserted evidence, if true, would necessarily have been available to him at the time of trial upon the exercise of due diligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2761.865" offset="11187154">Due process clause, likewise, does not require post trial consideration of newly asserted evidence relevant to guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.455" offset="11225501">The clause has limited operation beyond the specific guarantees of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights that adhere to the criminal procedures by which a defendant is brought to trial and tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.678" offset="11266461">Due process does not secure procedures, the due process clause does not secure procedures that are distinct or independent of the constitutionally designated trial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.368" offset="11305227">For example, despite the contemporary practice of providing a defendant with an appeal to review the constitutionality of his trial and conviction, the due process clause does not guarantee an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.692" offset="11354442">By analogy it follows that due process does not guarantee a post trial procedure by which a defendant can relitigate guilt, a procedure that is unrelated to the constitutionally designated trial process for determining guilt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2926.657" offset="11846380">Beck was based on both an Eighth Amendment and a due process analysis, and the Beck analysis with respect to the Eighth Amendment made it very clear that because the sentencing decision as to guilt or innocence also encompassed the jury's feelings as to the death penalty because of the unique way in which the Alabama statute was structured, Alabama was, under their statute at that time the jury either had to find the defendant guilty and at once find him eligible for the death sentence or find him innocent and acquit him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.496" offset="11985665">And they said that the guilt or innocence determination would be, also reflect the feelings as to the appropriateness of the death penalty and that that would violate the need for reliable and guided discretion as to the exercise of the sentencing determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.142" offset="12060270">So I don't think that Beck per se can be cited for the proposition that all guilt/innocence inquiries are relevant to the sentencing determination.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3079.321" offset="12457018">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.331" offset="12521070">We believe that the history of the development of Federal Rule 33, which is the rule of criminal procedure dealing with motions for a new trial, is instructive in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.852" offset="12559105">It's instructive because the debate that's being conducted today in terms of the due process and Eighth Amendment provisions of the Constitution was the type of debate that was conducted in the legal community nearly 50 years ago that this Court heard and considered before it adopted what is the current version of now Rule 33.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.766" offset="12634755">Originally the Federal courts could grant a new trial in accordance with the common law rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.818" offset="12655026">In order to obtain a new trial on the basis of a claim of newly discovered evidence the defendant would have to seek relief during the term of court in which he was originally sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.674" offset="12694419">In 1934 this Court modified the common law rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.459" offset="12709570">In the criminal appeals rules a district court was authorized to award a defendant a new trial on the basis of a newly discovered evidence claim if the defendant sought relief within 60 days of the day that the sentence became final.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.183" offset="12760457">4 years later, in 1938, this Court modified the rule to allow a condemned prisoner to file a claim of newly discovered evidence at any time before the sentence was carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.324" offset="12804969">At that point, late in the thirties and early in the forties, there was considerable debate in the legal community over the question whether all time limits for such motions should be abolished.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.232" offset="12848646">The argument in favor of their abolition was that eliminating time periods was necessary to prevent miscarriages of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.803" offset="12878948">The contrary argument, the argument in favor of the retention of such time periods, was that it was necessary to promote finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.641" offset="12906324">After hearing this debate this Court decided that the arguments in favor of finality outweighed those in favor of avoiding any risk of a miscarriage of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.247" offset="12944672">In 1944 this Court adopted what is now known as Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.068" offset="12967973">That rule sets a 2-year time period within which motions seeking a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence must be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.340" offset="13001097">That rule is jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.376" offset="13009247">And in setting that rule this Court abolished the special exception that previously had existed for capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.046" offset="13035892">The upshot is under today's rules applicable in the Federal system capital cases or non-capital cases are treated alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.034" offset="13063895">Now, it would be wrong, we think, to assume that today society for the first time--</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3279.910" offset="13259395">--The last one carried out was in the 1960's, but there were death sentences carried out by the Federal Government after this rule went into effect in 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.116" offset="13296176">Now we think it would be a mistake to say that society today for the first time is concerned about the risk of convicting, imprisoning, or executing an innocent defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.090" offset="13340061">And it would also be a mistake to conclude that today the balance of interests that might be conducted is so far superior to the balance of interests that was conducted by this Court nearly a half century ago that no time period can be said to be valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.731" offset="13394605">In fact the contemporary evidence in this regard supports the continued vitality of this Court's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.904" offset="13423340">Most states have fixed time periods for the consideration of newly discovered evidence motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.575" offset="13446014">The relevant rules and laws are collected in Appendix A to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.443" offset="13461479">Under those laws petitioner could not have obtained relief in the courts of at least 35 states, if not 41.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.632" offset="13494288">We think this widespread recognition that there should be some time period within which new trial motions based on newly discovered evidence must be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.054" offset="13527934">Coupled with the fact that the Constitution supplies no objective basis for preferring one time period over another indicates that it is not fundamentally unfair to set a fixed time period for the consideration in court of such motions and thereafter to channel such motions to the process of executive clemency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.998" offset="13595748">In fact Chief Justice Harlen Fisk Stone made that precise point in 1944 when he transmitted to the Federal rules advisory committee this Court's comments on what ultimately became Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.674" offset="13654367">Chief Justice Stone rhetorically asked is it not desirable that at some point of time further consideration of criminal cases by the Court should be at an end after which appeal should be made to executive clemency alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.683" offset="13706403">We submit that the answer to Chief Justice Stone's question is yes, the same answer this Court gave nearly a half century ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.321" offset="13732943">The procedure he described is the procedure we have historically followed, and that historical procedure is fully consistent with due process.</text>
