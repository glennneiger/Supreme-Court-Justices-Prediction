            <label>Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear</label>
            <text syncTime="56.968" offset="375977">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="60.791" offset="391337">The question in this case is whether the McCarran Amendment allows the State of Idaho to charge the United States with filing fees to pay for the costs of State water rights adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.457" offset="433969">This case has its origins in a dispute between the State of Idaho and the Idaho Power Company over the Company's right to use Snake River flows for power development.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.825" offset="475451">Idaho ultimately decided to conduct a general adjudication of all water rights in the Snake River Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.460" offset="501991">And it joined the United States pursuant to the McCarran Amendment, which is set forth at page 2 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.493" offset="522158">Congress enacted the McCarran Amendment to allow joinder of the United States in such adjudications, but it specifically provided that the United States is exempt from judgments for costs, which was the mechanism that Idaho and other States commonly used to pay... to pay for those adjudications at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.443" offset="589867">Nevertheless, Idaho has now asserted that it can charge the United States filing fees to the same end, to pay for the adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.819" offset="619438">We originally estimated that those fees would amount to at least $10 million in this litigation alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.002" offset="640127">We have now completed filing our various water rights claims with the Department of Water Resources and it appears that those fees will total at least $30 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.637" offset="674713">We challenged Idaho's fee assessments through a writ of mandamus, and the Idaho Supreme Court ultimately held by a vote of 3 to 2 that the McCarran Amendment requires the United States to pay those fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.995" offset="720166">We seek reversal of that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.014" offset="728212">As this Court has repeatedly recognized, the United States is immune from cost and fee assessments unless Congress expressly provides otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.870" offset="763634">The McCarran Amendment contains no such waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.752" offset="775128">An inspection of the McCarran Amendment's text proves our point.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.325" offset="789443">The first sentence, the so-called joinder provision, allows Idaho to join the United States as a defendant in the Snake River Basin adjudication, but it says nothing about requiring the United States to pay money.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.844" offset="839493">The mere consent to joinder is not consent to pay for the adjudication or to pay for the expenses of other parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.509" offset="866138">Well, Mr. Minear, the last sentence, the proviso, says no judgment for costs shall be entered against the United in such a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.886" offset="899680">Now, is it possible that these fees could be considered costs?</text>
            <text syncTime="194.050" offset="924339">They're paid in advance, but are they the type of fee that could be considered a cost?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear</label>
            <text syncTime="200.335" offset="949521">They certainly serve the very same function as a judgment for cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.978" offset="964045">In fact, the Idaho code makes that quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.301" offset="973345">It states, on page 2 of our brief, in order to provide an adequate and equitable cost-sharing formula for financing the costs of adjudicating water rights the Department of Water Resources shall... shall accept no claim... notice of claim, et cetera.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.604" offset="1234569">But at the same time, the United States reserves its right to object to any procedures that are aberrant or that are hostile to Federal interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.380" offset="1265707">For... assume, for example, that Idaho decided to determine water rights by a coin flip.</text>

            <text syncTime="836.346" offset="3493534">That our point is that the question here is the United States' immunity with respect to fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.730" offset="3511089">As to procedures, we believe that we do have... do reserve the right to challenge them on the basis that they are either unreasonable or hostile to Federal interests, but that's not a sovereign immunity question.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.756" offset="3547138">Again, that's simply the rights that we think are implicit within the McCarran Amendment, and I think rights that were recognized in footnote 20 of San Carlos where you noticed that State procedures might be inadequate to adjudicate certain types of Federal water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.004" offset="3596143">The... the crucial question here, though, is whether there has been an express waiver of fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.516" offset="3614220">And I think it's important to note that in 1952 when this act was enacted, Congress was quite clear that there did need to be a separate waiver for... for fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.492" offset="3650060">In fact, 2412(a) at that time, 28 U.S.C. 2412 (a) made that point, that Congress is not liable for fees or costs unless there is an express waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.728" offset="3687049">And I don't think that ultimately Idaho or the Idaho Supreme Court has quarreled with the need for a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.863" offset="3707634">The question has been, instead, whether the McCarran Amendment is explicit or clear enough on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.939" offset="3731876">And we believe that the McCarran Amendment is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.070" offset="3740444">It does not say anything about fees, and the only point where it discusses monetary liabilities is with respect to a judgment for costs.</text>

            <text syncTime="968.881" offset="4023611">Now, at the time the McCarran Amendment was enacted, the most common way for paying for these types of procedures was through a judgment of costs at the end of the litigation, and the McCarran Amendment made quite clear that the United States was not subject to those judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.081" offset="4076483">Now, we think that the clear implication of that is the United States is not responsible for paying for the adjudication or for paying the fees and expenses of its adversaries in the adjudication.</text>

            <text syncTime="1452.471" offset="5958031">All the aspects of those proceedings are governed by those State statutory procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.635" offset="5978720">Absent a waiver as to those State laws, the State would not be able to apply its statutory procedures to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.991" offset="6012052">And that's the contention that we have before the Court, is that it's necessary to have that waiver and the second sentence reaches those instances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1473.926" offset="6043817">If you accept the United States' interpretation that it only... that the second sentence only extends to those laws governing the acquisition of water rights, then it would be rendering meaningless the same phrase with respect to suits for administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.984" offset="6100032">Because in suits for administration, the issue is not the acquisition of a State water right, it's a question of how the decree is going to be administrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.491" offset="6134096">And for example, the futile call doctrine, which says that if a senior water right could call for water but by calling for that water there would not be sufficient water to meet the purposes of that water right, you could not exercise it against a junior water user.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.921" offset="6199820">That provision has to be incorporated, otherwise you would not be able to administer the particular decrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.746" offset="6223121">So what we're contending is simply that the State laws must refer to those bodies of law that deal directly with administration and adjudication of water rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1555.570" offset="6370452">Our contention is that as to the laws that govern the determination of those water rights, it will be based upon either Federal or State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.556" offset="6398351">But in the context of making those determinations, the McCarran Amendment is a procedural statute that was designed to allow the States to apply those laws that govern the conduct of their adjudications to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.985" offset="6452058">And in this instance, it allows the imposition of filing fees, because filing fees are part and parcel of those procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.310" offset="6485391">One of the reasons the McCarran Amendment was enacted was to ensure the availability of the comprehensive State proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.404" offset="6509737">Those proceedings originally started out as a quite title action in which there was an adversarial relationship, but over time the Western States developed a specialized procedure that moved away from that process and instead developed a process that's more akin to an interpleader action or an in rem action, in which all parties are brought in who may have a claim to that resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.868" offset="6599598">And by bringing them all into the case, then everyone is able to have certainty that the water rights that are decreed in that adjudication are final.</text>

            <text syncTime="1731.843" offset="7075549">It recognizes that a State may have the ability, by this waiver, to adjudicate those water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.147" offset="7104702">And the substantive rules that govern the actual acquisition of those water rights have already been established long before you ever get to the adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.613" offset="7134586">When you get to the adjudication, you're simply determining the relationship of the rights as with respect to one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.245" offset="7157156">And the benefits of the State system that Congress deferred to, I think really informs this particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.672" offset="7186831">Because, as I was suggesting, it's an in rem action where all parties, whether you have a water right or not, are brought in to make sure that the final decree is binding on everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.599" offset="7226537">And in order to do that, it's a very complicated process where everyone in a State has to be served who has potential interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.156" offset="7256734">Once that service is done, then you have to take all of the claims and relate them to one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.218" offset="7277005">In the Snake River Basin adjudication, for example, the trial court, with the assistance of the Department of Water Resources, will have to evaluate 120,000 claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.695" offset="7314935">Those claims will all be consolidated into one single report that will list where those water rights are from an area that's the size of the State of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York combined, and say how they relate to one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.103" offset="7372509">Then the parties come in and file objections to that report.</text>

            <text syncTime="1812.668" offset="7398840">It allows an efficiency in the process that would not otherwise exist in the traditional quiet title action where every party would be responsible for conducting those very activities that the State, through the use of the filing fees, has been able to consolidate in the director and make the proceeding more efficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="1947.881" offset="7939680">And in this case, because of the structure of the statutory procedures, the filing fees are an integral part of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.976" offset="7964026">Indeed, in 1916 in the Pacific Live Stock v. Lewis case, this Court specifically examined a system, that was similar to Idaho's, in the State of Oregon in which a variable fee was charged for claimants to have their water rights adjudicated in the Oregon comprehensive adjudication procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.718" offset="8039049">And the Court found that the imposition of these fees was an appropriate action by the State because of the benefits received by the claimants from the services provided by the State engineer in those adjudications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.729" offset="8099027">The importance of that case comes, I think, in terms of the references in the legislative history and the congressional report that was submitted in conjunction with the McCarran Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2040.880" offset="8311663">The State's contention is simply that the McCarran Amendment intended to provide flexibility to the States in the way they conduct these general stream adjudications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.741" offset="8367147">And contrary to the United States' assertion, at the time of the enactment of the McCarran Amendment these were not normally recovered by judgments for costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.545" offset="8398285">Indeed, an examination of those statutes will show that in the States of Oregon, Arizona, and Nevada, variable filing fees were used; in the States of Washington, Colorado, and California, fixed fees were used; and in other States, the fees were simply apportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.460" offset="8478011">The director was not a part of those particular adjudications, but was invited by the court to come in as a special expert, and then the court apportioned those fees amongst all parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.206" offset="8516986">And so rather than the uniformity of a judgment for costs as a way to recover these costs in 1952, the state of the body of law shows that it was quite differing aspects in all States of how those particular costs or expenses were recovered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2117.597" offset="8618550">The way it worked in Idaho in 1952 was that the State engineer was invited into the proceeding by the court, and he would make an estimate of the expenses that he would incur in preparing the director's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.188" offset="8672885">Once those expenses were calculated, he would submit those to the State auditor who would take them to the board of examiners for evaluation and then finally that would be referred back to the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3229.721" offset="13066994">However, when Congress wrote the McCarran Amendment, it also provided the second clause... the second clause of the pleading provision: The United States, when a party to any such suit, shall be subject to the judgments, orders, and decrees of the court having jurisdiction, provided that no judgment for costs shall be entered against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.761" offset="13135226">Now, the purpose of the cost proviso was to make absolutely clear that the mere fact that we are subject to judgments for costs... for judgments generally, did not mean we were subject to judgments for costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.478" offset="13174096">And that explains why it... read in the context of section 2412(a), the cost proviso was inserted there, to make it absolutely clear that the United States was not expected to pick up these expenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="3308.834" offset="13383493">And a party may charge a paid fee as a cost, but the Supreme Court of Idaho is certainly right as to the distinction between fees and costs, I think.</text>

            <text syncTime="3317.660" offset="13418811">Why, I think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.592" offset="13422468">But nevertheless, the United States still does not pay fees even to a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.486" offset="13438037">That's made clear in the notes of 28 U.S.C. 1914, for instance, where it recognizes that although fees may be assessed against parties, the United States does not pay fees in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.192" offset="13480878">Now, that's the common law rule that's been followed here, and I think that Idaho has really seized upon the absence of the word filing fees to turn what used to be judgments for costs into filing fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.998" offset="13520166">They mention, for instance, the court-appointed experts, the fact that we're simply paying for a court-appointed expert.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.352" offset="13545557">A court-appointed expert is an assessable cost under section 1920 of the judicial code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.747" offset="13571157">That is one of the costs that a person could, in fact, get compensation for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.701" offset="13586935">So I think it's clear that what they've really done is taken a procedure whereby the State was precluded from charging the United States with the expense of the litigation by the cost proviso, and tried to get around that by collecting the fees up front through filing... a filing fee system, which may bear very little relationship to the actual costs incurred.</text>
