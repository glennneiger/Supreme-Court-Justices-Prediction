            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="137143">We'll hear argument now in No. 92-1, Lynwood Moreau v. Johnny Klevenhagen.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.667" offset="175804">Mr. Leibig.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael T. Leibig</label>
            <text syncTime="12.389" offset="186671">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.211" offset="197956">The concern before the Court today involves the precise rules under which a state or local employer may reach agreements to substitute time off for cash overtime with their employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.999" offset="249052">It involves the interpretation of section 207(o) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and regulations issued under that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.836" offset="292415">It is important that, under the usual rules, to realize that the Fair Labor Standards Act makes non-cash payment for overtime work illegal completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.833" offset="332434">It always has, and there is a reason for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.155" offset="341734">In 1937 when President Roosevelt first sent a message to Congress about the Fair Labor Standards Act he emphasized that one of the main purposes was to protect the unorganized and to establish an hours of work rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.941" offset="396905">It might seem that the comp time rule, or the cash overtime rule, isn't directly related to the overtime rules, but it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.589" offset="427416">The reason cash overtime is required is because other schemes that were in existence widely in the United States before 1937, for instance paying for overtime in script or paying for overtime in time off or comp time are easily manipulated to avoid the 40-hour-a-week work rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.011" offset="501185">And that's the reason that the Fair Labor Standards Act itself, prior to the 1985 amendments which adjusted the act to the public sector, always outlawed compensatory time as a means of paying for overtime work.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.049" offset="557296">In the 1985 amendments, after this Court's decision in Garcia, Congress responded a request from state and local governments to lighten the burdens that the Fair Labor Standards Act without a special statute would place on state and local government, and made a number of changes in the acts in specific response to pleas by state and local governments and their employees that special adjustments be made to recognize the special status of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.757" offset="656144">The states were effective in those pleas, and section 2 of the 1985 amendments allowed the use of comp time and also changed the rules with regard to volunteers and a number of other rules with regard to joint employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.204" offset="709956">Part of the amendments, section 6, expressly directed the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations interpreting and implementing the 1985 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.714" offset="767948">It is our argument that section 207(o) that deals with compensatory time and the conditions under which a public employer may use compensatory time that is not otherwise available, and are laid out in 207(o)(2)(A), require an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.426" offset="846838">And the issue that the Court needs to address today are the precise conditions under which an agreement needs to be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.374" offset="890619">There are a couple--</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_t_leibig" startTime="201.746" stopTime="217.166">
            <label>Mr. Michael T. Leibig</label>
            <text syncTime="201.746" offset="944118">Your Honor, I'm not sure completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.188" offset="957806">I'm not... I wouldn't be surprised if it had something to do with the fact that the briefs in this case were due almost immediately after the election in which the administration changed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="217.166" stopTime="217.924">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="217.166" offset="1005767">I see.</text>

          <turn speaker="michael_t_leibig" startTime="217.924" stopTime="360.507">
            <label>Mr. Michael T. Leibig</label>
            <text syncTime="217.924" offset="1008797">And I think that relates directly to one of the arguments I want to make which has to do with why regulations, when there's a statute... the way the Fair Labor Standards Act works generally is that it's an administrative act which is very dependent on the regulations not only for the use of comp time but across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.866" offset="1072536">And one of the flexibilities in the act, the portions of the act that are in regulations are in the Executive Branch, given to the Executive Branch by Congress, I think, partly specifically because of the increased flexibility that that allows over if they were in the statute themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.047" offset="1141290">And I think the increased flexibility has been demonstrated particularly under the 1985 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.690" offset="1163860">Not only did Congress make new amendments, but since then on issues in which the states have been particularly concerned they have gone to the Department of Labor and got adjustments to the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.079" offset="1213388">In the Abshire case, which is a Ninth Circuit case dealing with who is exempt and who is not, that case was appealed to the Court and the Court denied cert. But at the same time state and local governments went to the Department of Labor and the Department of Labor changed the rules with regard to exemption specifically to recognize the special needs of state and local government.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.900" offset="1288725">And that shows one of the reasons that it's wise under the Fair Labor Standards Act to have regulations dealing with this kind of an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.207" offset="1329894">I want to emphasize that Congress was unmistakably clear that states, as states, are covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.085" offset="1365421">Both section 203 of the act itself, subsections (d) and (x), and section 207(o), part 1, expressly and clearly leave no doubt that state and local employees are covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.982" offset="1408993">Secondly, the 1985 amendments make it absolutely clear that the state function, that is personnel functions and the relationship between personnel functions and the payment of overtime, is also specifically and clearly regulated by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.842" offset="1476493">The question that I think the statute is ambiguous about is whether or not... it is also clear that the statute requires an agreement prior to an employer using compensatory time.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.448" offset="1518916">Where the ambiguity lies is, in the situation where the employees designate a representative to deal with the employer, must an agreement be reached with the representative prior to the implementation of compensatory time system.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.319" offset="1574400">And I think the--</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="360.507" offset="1579102">Is that ambiguity solved by the Department of Labor's reg, the one that, well, it's set out on page 28 of the red brief, that the question of whether employees have a representative for purposes of 7(o) shall be determined in accordance with state or local law?</text>
            <text syncTime="375.738" offset="1640020">I mean, does that, is that the source of resolving the ambiguity?</text>

            <text syncTime="380.733" offset="1659977">--The regulation is, but what is quoted on page... the reference to state law that is quoted in the red brief is not a reference to the regulations, it's a reference to the preamble to the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.289" offset="1702296">And that sentence in the preamble is put in the middle of sentences before it and after it which address one of the direct questions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.715" offset="1735941">The question asked in which the reference to state law was made was in a state that has... do you mean that you on need an agreement in states which have collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.032" offset="1777215">And the preamble says no, we didn't mean that, our regulations don't say that, but we do believe that to determine who the representative is in a given state there may be a reference to state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="423.139" offset="1829669">But isn't it also to be read by saying to determine whether there is a representative the purposes of subsection 1 you look to state law?</text>
            <text syncTime="432.736" offset="1868016">In other words does this in a way take the same position the, I think it was the Senate version of the legislat history took?</text>

          <turn speaker="michael_t_leibig" startTime="441.451" stopTime="537.804">
            <label>Mr. Michael T. Leibig</label>
            <text syncTime="441.451" offset="1902916">I think there are two questions there, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.053" offset="1921306">The first is the difference between the Senate and the House report.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.065" offset="1933323">If I could hold that a minute I will comment on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.158" offset="1941682">The other question a whether you look for state law, I do think you look to state law to determine whether or not there's a representative, but when you look to state law you do not look merely to state collective bargaining law.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.025" offset="1985150">In other words you're not just looking to state law to see whether or not there's a collective bargaining statute or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.209" offset="2001972">If you were, the wording in the statute would be much simpler than it is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.671" offset="2019736">It would not refer to all the things other than collective bargaining, which even little (i)(1) refers to.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.005" offset="2037081">So that you do look to state law, but you look for such things as if there is state law providing for collective bargaining, then state law requires exclusive representation and requires that unilateral changes can't be made on any wage-hour working condition without dealing with that representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.563" offset="2099357">That model, the National Labor Relations model, exists in less than 25 states, and even in those states there are all sorts of other models in place for different types of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.820" offset="2136346">Most states have different types of models ranging from a meet and confer model, where you have to meet but you don't have to agree, to having a situation in Texas where there's a Texas state statute that says employees can have a representative, but the representatives don't have the rights to collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.541" offset="2199249">So that I think--</text>
            <text syncTime="516.940" offset="2204892">But what the preamble to the regulation says, and I want to make clear this is the preamble to the regulation, so you've got to go to, it's a long drive from the statute to the preamble, but the preamble to the regulations I think are trying to say if two people show up or three people show up and say they're the representative, you look to state law, it might be agency law, it might be all sorts of law in the state.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="537.804" offset="2288274">Why don't you just as readily look to state law to determine what the significance of the designation of the representative is in states which do not allow collective bargaining agreements?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael T. Leibig</label>
            <text syncTime="548.162" offset="2329757">Because under the preamble, under that set reference in the preamble, which is the only reference to state law in this area anyway, if you read the whole paragraph it starts off by somebody asking exactly that question, do you look to state law to find out whether a collective bargaining representative can enter in full agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.844" offset="2404467">And the answer that the Department of Labor in the preamble gave is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.105" offset="2417528">It's also the clear answer in the... the plain meaning of the regulations themselves contain a clear statement that the representative... what matters is the designation of the employees, not the recognition of the employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="617.796" offset="2608327">The House report refers to designated representatives, and the regulation, that is the regulation on 30a through 32a, adopt pretty much the House report.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.676" offset="2659840">The argument is made by the petitioners that the House report may support that, but what about the Senate report.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.119" offset="2681574">And I think the answer to that is if you look with rigor at the House and Senate report you will find that the actual language of section 207(o) is the direct language of the House report, not the Senate report.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.557" offset="2723370">During the conference committee this section, it was the language of the House report that became 207(o) precisely, and if you compare it you will see what I mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.992" offset="2765061">I don't think there were differences in the wording for this point in the statutory language, but the structure of the House report became... therefore you look to the legislative history of the House report and not the Senate report because the language that was enacted is the House language.</text>

            <text syncTime="723.655" offset="3031719">No, Your Honor, I don't think if you look to Gregory v. Ashcroft you would come to a different conclusion, for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.768" offset="3056170">First of all, I think on its face Gregory speaks of interfering with the usual state and local functions, and it does not, it seems to refer to the question of coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.448" offset="3106847">The conference Congress has to be clear about coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.320" offset="3118341">I grant it, not just coverage of the states as states, but also coverage of the function of the state that is being regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.075" offset="3145404">Everybody agrees that this statute regulates the use of comp time by state and local employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.858" offset="3172572">The question that the statute is ambiguous about is how do you arrange comp time agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.692" offset="3187827">In the statute, if you look to Gregory, Congress expressly says in the statute, there is an express delegation to regulations, and the regulations do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.636" offset="3223667">Now, the reason I think... it's really the interchange between Chevron and Gregory, and how do you read those together.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.501" offset="3247073">And I don't think the Court, I don't think that there are precedent I can cite to say how you read the two together.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.984" offset="3269016">I think that's a real challenging situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.026" offset="3281241">I do think, though, if Gregory meant to abandon Chevron we are launched on a very dangerous course because, for example in the Report on Intergovernmental Relations that was submitted by the amici it lists a great number of statutes, 32 statutes, I believe, passed before 1981 that regulate state and local functions, and most of those statutes rely on regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.802" offset="3380297">The Fair Labor Standards Act will not work without its regulations, not just on the comp time issue, but it wouldn't work on many issues, and Congress knew that.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.407" offset="3410704">So I think that's the first point.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.540" offset="3419272">The second point is I do think, and there has been a number of law review commentary on the importance of increased rigor for Chevron, at least when it interacts with Gregory, but some would say generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.157" offset="3469741">To the degree that you are a literalist or a strict constructionist in a general sense, that's strictly looking at the words and meanings of the statutes, then you should also be quite rigorous about Chevron, and I recognize that.</text>

            <text syncTime="914.461" offset="3794913">If you just read the terms of the statute you get a situation, as read by Harris County, you get a situation where the statute would then say if you want an agreement you need a collective bargaining agreement, a memorandum of understanding, any other form of agreement, an agreement with individuals, or an agreement with individual employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.594" offset="3875474">That basically covers every possible type of agreement you have.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.836" offset="3888431">If that's what this means, you didn't need section 2(A) at all because you could have just said the employer can have comp time whenever they want to because all they have to do is refuse every agreement and they are automatically in a place where they can impose, as Harris County did as a condition of employment, comp time.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.188" offset="3957812">So if that's what Congress meant, first of all they didn't need any of these words.</text>

            <text syncTime="968.017" offset="4009117">I mean, you're quite right that they could get there by simply refusing every agreement, but realistically that's not an available option.</text>

            <text syncTime="985.067" offset="4077349">But it is an available option in more than, for police employees, for example, well over 50 percent of total police employees in the United States it is an available option.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.173" offset="4113816">It's an option in fact in this case Harris County took.</text>

            <text syncTime="1036.289" offset="4282253">In that case, though, 2 little (i) would just say collective bargaining agreements, it wouldn't say... first of all it wouldn't say memorandum of understanding in the normal sense, but you could argue about that, but it wouldn't say any other agreement between the public agency and representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.908" offset="4332722">Obviously this statute is not meant to provide only, that you only need agreement in states with collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.455" offset="4370861">I think you do need an agreement in states with collective bargaining, and that's why the preamble to the regulations makes the reference to looking at state law to find out how state law sets up rights of representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.322" offset="4410358">I would emphasize in Texas there isn't a collective bargaining statute, but there is a statute that says public employees can deal with their employer through a representative, not to reach contracts but to deal with them on all sorts of other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.098" offset="4453512">And the actual representative in this case regularly represents its members in grievances and before the city council in all sorts of ways, and has other agreements with Harris County that are enforced regularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.494" offset="4495099">It has a dues check off agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1092.976" offset="4508996">So that you're right, if Congress wanted to say there is only two situations, states with collective bargaining, and they have certain special rights, and states without collective bargaining, and in those states you can impose this as a term and condition of employment, they wouldn't have used these words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.916" offset="4568764">More than that, what this... these words are ambiguous is you look at them rigorously, and therefore what these words meant Congress vested in the Department of Labor, appropriately I would say even under a rigorous application of Chevron, to decide, not in the courts to decide, in the Department of Labor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1277.370" offset="5246590">But let me make another point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.702" offset="5251919">If you look... first of all, if you read it there is doubt about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.315" offset="5266338">Enough doubt at least, I would argue, to look at the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.788" offset="5280235">Both the Senate and the House report don't agree... do agree about one thing, that (i) is meant to apply only where, in every case where there's a representative, and (ii) only applies where there is not a representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.225" offset="5333943">And both the Senate and the House reports are very clear about that, and specifically indicate at, in the Senate report in the petitioner's Appendix at 101A and in the House report at 36A.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.644" offset="5383680">So they both say the meaning that I said is what it means, that whether there's an agreement or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.389" offset="5410639">Another reason is the logical course of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.121" offset="5421610">If you do not have... if (i) only applies to where there are actually agreements, then even in states where there is collective bargaining, if there was a collective bargaining agreement between a designated representative and the state and it didn't deal with comp time, petitioner would argue they can use comp time, even though under state law they would not ordinarily be able to use comp time because they would be changing wage-hour working conditions unilaterally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.067" offset="5517323">Therefore if that's what it meant you would raise the same problems that petitioners complain about, that is Congress imposing on states that chose to have collective bargaining a requirement other than their law would require.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.337" offset="5570403">So that the lack of logic... one of the reasons that you look beyond the statute is the lack of logic of the other interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.053" offset="5609274">Now, I must admit to get to the full brunt of the lack of logic you have to look at what is this all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.667" offset="5631739">This whole thing is to keep states from using comp time in a way that would undermine the basic 40-hour standard in the statute, which it can easily do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.303" offset="5674266">Let me give you an example what happens in Harris County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.296" offset="5682312">What actually happens in Harris County is an individual deputy sheriff, it's 4 o'clock in the afternoon and the county needs somebody to work until midnight, the individual deputy is supposed to get off at 6, the county can, and this is legitimate, nobody has disputed this, can order them to stay until midnight, work 6 extra hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.217" offset="5749917">Without these amendments they would have to pay for that in cash, but Congress, in order to lift burdens from the state, said you can pay for that time in comp time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2024.622" offset="8235625">This Court had just decided the Garcia case in February of 197... 1985, which extended provisions of the FLSA to state and local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.269" offset="8278152">However, a great variety of compensatory time arrangements had developed between public employers and their employees, and long-standing practices existed concerning the use of compensatory time which were of mutual benefit to both the public employee and the public employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.683" offset="8359863">This background of mutually beneficial compensatory time arrangements was the background in which Congress passed section 207(o).</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.728" offset="8403958">Already by November of 1985 Congress had passed section (o) to help public employees and public employers preserve their mutually beneficial compensatory time practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.728" offset="8459964">Congress was not for a minute going to allow the full weight of the Garcia decision to descend upon the public employers, be they state governments or local government entities.</text>

            <text syncTime="3597.050" offset="14525283">If they do designate the representative then you should have to deal with the representative.</text>
