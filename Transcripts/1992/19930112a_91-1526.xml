            <text syncTime="66.965" offset="399082">Congress designed RICO to eliminate any business which has committed two or more predicate RICO offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.050" offset="431474">Such a business then becomes illegal and therefore forfeitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.412" offset="444849">Under the First Amendment, the presumption is that no matter how many speech violations a business may commit, it retains its protected status because all unlitigated materials are presumed to be constitutionally protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.085" offset="511513">This case then presents the collision between RICO and the First Amendment made inevitable by the 1984 congressional amendment adding obscenity to the predicate list of RICO offenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="109.123" offset="567729">Well, is... what... which of our cases do you rely on, Mr. Weston, for the proposition that when obscenity is charged, it is presumed that it is not obscene?</text>

            <text syncTime="148.770" offset="726344">You're saying that anyone is... if it's a criminal prosecution, you're presumed innocent until you're found guilty.</text>

            <text syncTime="155.696" offset="754034">With the... with respect to the materials alleged to be obscene, a host of cases, including all of the so-called search and seizure cases, Marcus and Quantity of Books, Fort Wayne Books, and a host of others, have all stood for the proposition that even where material is being accused by government of being obscene until such time as it is finally determined to be obscene, it may not be removed from the public totally because to do so would constitute a total prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.815" offset="874511">And, in fact, in Heller, this Court went so far in 1973 as to note that where a single motion picture film was available to an exhibitor seized by government as part of an obscenity prosecution, it was the duty of government to make at least a copy of that film available or to permit the defendant to have a copy of the film so that the film might continue to be exhibited until such time as it was ultimately determined to be obscene.</text>

            <text syncTime="212.612" offset="981717">That established that you can't seize it under those conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.615" offset="993734">I don't think it established the proposition that you're talking about.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.338" offset="1008571">Well, with all respect, I see no difference with respect to that, Your Honor, that if the material is presumed to be protected until it is ultimately deprived judicially of its protected status, under that circumstance, it retains the presumption of protectedness and simply may not be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.807" offset="1066459">Our point, however, is with respect to this case, that other than the seven items determined to be obscene by the jury in this case, all of the other material that was seized and destroyed by the Government pursuant to the forfeiture order was neither alleged nor proven to be obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.389" offset="1144826">And the Government is quite candid in that the nature of the material is totally irrelevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="987.504" offset="4081198">But the classical difference is, as pointed out by Near and in a host of subsequent cases, there are special rules, special concerns, that we have for the First Amendment, and the nature of the injunction that was issued in Near would have caused no problem if, as in Arcara, the predicate or triggering conduct had had nothing to do with speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.526" offset="4197286">Why was it that this Court... forgive the rhetorical question, but this Court struggled and wrestled with the problem in Arcara because, in fact, a bookstore was enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.702" offset="4250054">The ultimate conclusion was that where the triggering conduct either had no speech at all or had no communicative content or no expressive conduct which was involved in the sanction, that it simply was not a prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.593" offset="4309613">But the obvious implication, if not explication, in both Chief Justice Burger's opinion and in Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion is that where the triggering activity was either speech or had communicative conduct or, as Justice O'Connor noted, where a nonspeech triggering statute had been used as a pretext to impose censorship in the interest of decency, then there would have to be a First Amendment analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.491" offset="4425179">And in this case, the only underlying conduct, the only triggering or predicate conduct is unquestionably speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="2008.762" offset="8166227">What I think we have seen today is, first of all, an assault on Fort Wayne Books without his having said in the petition that he wants to see Fort Wayne Books overruled.</text>

            <text syncTime="2040.124" offset="8291719">That ends up being quite a remarkable proposition that is unfounded in this Court's First Amendment jurisprudence.</text>
