            <text syncTime="12.299" offset="191523">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.220" offset="203226">A divided panel of the D.C. Circuit took the extraordinary step of invalidating a portion of an act of Congress, the Cable Act of 1984, on rational basis grounds under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.061" offset="266651">In particular, the court rejected Congress' judgment that there is less reason for imposing a franchise requirement when cable facilities serve only commonly owned, controlled, or managed multiple-unit dwellings.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.283" offset="335510">Instead, the court concluded that the only rational dividing line between franchised and unfranchised facilities in the use of public rights-of-way.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.161" offset="383053">We submit that the court of appeals erred in redrafting the reasonable line drawn by Congress in defining the term, 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.129" offset="434880">The crux of the issue in this case is the proper classification of satellite master antenna television, or SMATV.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.876" offset="477825">Unlike traditional cable systems, which pick up distant signals at a remote antenna and transmit them to the community through wires running under or over the city streets, an SMATV facility typically sets up a rooftop antenna and then transmits programming by wire to units in a building or group of buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.622" offset="576882">In enacting the Cable Act of 1984, Congress had to decide whether and when an SMATV system should be treated like a traditional cable facility and made subject to franchise requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.752" offset="641352">Contrary to the court of appeals' decision, the line drawn by congress was a reasonable one: an SMATV system is exempt from any franchise requirement if the system serves only multiple-unit dwellings under common ownership, control, or management, and uses no public rights of way.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.826" offset="837688">There are, for example, technical requirements dealing with signal interference, with the quality of the signal, and there are other requirements pertaining to rate regulation and so forth that apply to cable systems, but the only thing that's at issue here is whether it's constitutional to impose a franchise requirement on an SMATV facility that serves only commonly-owned buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.151" offset="930997">In enacting the so-called private cable exemption with its common-ownership requirement, Congress made the judgment that it did not want to impose franchise requirements on a building owner or condominium association that decides to put a satellite antenna on the building and provide cable television to its residents, perhaps as an amenity.</text>

            <text syncTime="260.464" offset="1184176">The act describes a franchise authority as a Federal, State, or local authority that has power to issue a license, but in practice what it means is a State or local franchise, not a Federal franchise, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="273.072" offset="1234645">So although the act may not be clear, that is in practice what happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.053" offset="1250527">If you're subject to this requirement you must get a franchise from a State or local government.</text>

            <text syncTime="283.778" offset="1277486">That's correct, it's a State or local... in practice a State or local franchise requirement, and what Congress decided was that if a building owner or a condo association decides to put a satellite dish on the roof of the building and provide cable service to its tenants, then that would not be subject to a local franchise requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.152" offset="1350942">Similarly, if the same building owner or condo association ran a couple of buildings, or ran a building complex and put a satellite antenna on the roof to provide cable television to all the residents in the complex, that also would not be subject to a local franchise requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.352" offset="1419801">But where a satellite antenna is set up to serve multiple, separately-owned buildings, or if its wires run over or under the city streets, Congress made the determination that the facility looks more like a traditional cable system and should be subject to franchise requirements accordingly.</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. Manning</label>
            <text syncTime="360.839" offset="1585731">--It could be quite a number of people, and the judgment that Congress made, that the common-ownership requirement in addition to the right-of-way requirement was a rational basis for distinguishing between franchised and unfranchised facilities, was a reasonable line.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.180" offset="1647066">The essence of the rational-basis test is that debatable policy judgments are left to Congress, not the Federal courts, and as this Court explained most recently in Sullivan v. Stroop, a classification in a piece of socioeconomic legislation must be sustained if any state of facts may reasonably be conceived to justify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.103" offset="1730762">Under that standard, the line-drawn by Congress in this case easily passes constitutional muster.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.297" offset="1759497">If a satellite antenna serves only a commonly owned building or set of buildings, a plausible legislator could think that it is more likely that the service is being provided as part of the package of services that management provides to its residents, that it's an incident of residency.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.999" offset="1830341">Equivalently, a reasonable legislator could conclude that the service provided by such a satellite antenna would be less likely to be run in the nature of an independent business venture, but even if you take a building complex--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="439.339" offset="1899722">What would be the virtue of that conclusion, that it would be less likely to be run as an independent business venture?</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. Manning</label>
            <text syncTime="445.804" offset="1925531">--Well, you would think that if you were an owner of a building and you were putting up a satellite dish and providing the service to your tenants, that your primary interest would be in keeping your tenants happy, because you are making a lot more money from their rent, or from their condo fee, than you are from providing them with cable service.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.446" offset="1996166">So in that situation, you could conclude that there would be less need to interpose a franchising authority to provide consumer protection, when the building itself is really the provider of the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.254" offset="2047366">But even if you have a situation where the building is making a contract with an outside SMATV company to set up a satellite antenna on the building, to run the wires, own the wires, service the building, arrange for the programming, and bill the tenants separately, that company is still accountable to one set of owners for the service that it provides from that dish.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.244" offset="2159380">Every subscriber who gets service off of that satellite antenna can voice his or her complaints or desires to a single set of owners, and the ownership has a strong incentive to keep the subscribers happy, since there is a substantial interest in keeping the rental fees and the condo fees flowing.</text>

            <text syncTime="523.765" offset="2237433">Mr. Manning, is it correct, I guess almost as a matter of definition, that on the scenario you're just describing, every unit of buildings is going to have to have its own complete system?</text>
            <text syncTime="536.766" offset="2289469">I mean, there's going to have to be an antenna, and so on, so the... what I'm getting at is the investment is going to be much greater in the cases subject to the exception and the cancellation of the business would consequently be far more disastrous.</text>

            <text syncTime="550.504" offset="2344326">I mean, it wouldn't necessarily be a single business, but it would be a single... a single building... I'm sorry, a single building, but it would be a building or building complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.707" offset="2373166">And what you would do is, you would... it would involve the construction of a satellite head end, and it may or may not involve wiring the buildings, because a lot of these buildings have the old mater antenna television system wiring already in place, so you might or might not be able to use that.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.186" offset="2431157">So there is a substantial investment in building the satellite head end facility, and if you were serving a single set of buildings, and the ownership cancels that contract, then you've lost out a lot.</text>

            <text syncTime="593.771" offset="2517466">And what's more, if a satellite antenna is not limited to serving commonly owned buildings, as Justice Scalia pointed out, it may well be expected, or a reasonable legislature could at least think that you would tend to have more subscribers served by that satellite antenna, because you could wire an entire city block in New York by running a wire from building to building.</text>

            <text syncTime="718.533" offset="3016509">That issue was raised very clearly in the Fritz case, where the dissent said that the evidence in that case involved a question of line-drawing between those who would be eligible for dual benefits under the social security system and the railroad retirement system and those who would not be eligible for that double-dipping, and Congress drew a line based on whether one was serving in the... to summarize very sketchily, whether one was serving in the railroad industry or had a current connection in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.343" offset="3139703">The dissent said that that line disserved the purposes of the statute as expressed in the legislative history because it didn't provide all of the people who had vested railroad retirement benefits with their ultimate benefits, and this Court said that the purposes of a statute for purposes of the rational-basis test did not have to be reflected in the legislative history, and that it was</text>
