            <text syncTime="1254.160" offset="5158489">But I think the problem with, you know, relying on the McClanahan case is that they quoted the language in McClanahan that said the Federal statute requires that the State law be excluded in this area, and the Tenth Circuit did not point to any Federal statute that excludes law for Oklahoma in regards to the Sac and Fox Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.305" offset="5255142">I think that relevant statute is the allotment agreement and it does... nothing in that allotment agreement would presume to exclude State law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1518.474" offset="6215821">It's common for States... and Oklahoma is one of these States... to tax income on the basis of either where the individual resides or works, and as long as that statute is applied in an evenhanded manner, the territorial principles, McClanahan would not bar the tax if the individual either resided or worked off the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.908" offset="6297532">We do think it's significant, however, that Oklahoma affords a credit to a resident who works in another State, but does not afford a comparable credit to a resident who works for the Indian tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.028" offset="6353957">So, in the example of someone who... an Indian who lives off the reservation, but works on the reservation, we would think a parallel to Oklahoma's own State taxing scheme would suggest that a credit might be given.</text>

            <text syncTime="2009.873" offset="8181379">It said even within Indian country, which the Court pointed out specifically included allotments, a State may have jurisdiction over some persons or types of conduct, but this jurisdiction is quite limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.710" offset="8220772">And the Court specifically cited McClanahan after that recitation, indicating that the immunity from State taxation should apply even though the reservation was disestablished wherever you have Indian country and, thus, we think wherever the individual is residing and working within Indian country, as long a there is a functioning tribal government with jurisdiction over that particular land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.127" offset="8310424">Here we think that the compact of tribal self-government entered into between the Sac and Fox Nation and the United States demonstrates the tribal self-government, contrary to the view of the State of Oklahoma, is alive and well in the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="2060.289" offset="8383044">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.855" offset="8413346">We believe that this case can be resolved by straightforward application of this Court's per se rule and the rules of stare decisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.909" offset="8445529">The Court has ruled previously in several cases, in which the Court did not recognize that there was an existing Indian reservation, that State taxes, at least as to tribal members within Indian country were not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.530" offset="8499968">Those cases include Rickert, the Kansas Indians, the New York Indians, several other cases cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.501" offset="8523896">Now, the State would have you believe that the tribe here is totally subject to State law, that the Indian reservation of the Sac and Fox Nation was abolished back in 1891, and that the tribe is not a tribe in the normal sense of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.274" offset="8594950">I don't believe that any of those are true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.946" offset="8601637">Now, the per se rule that this Court has developed has been applied in the early cases I just mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.933" offset="8637581">In Montana v. Blackfeet, the State... the Court said that the States may tax Indians only when Congress has manifested clearly its consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.270" offset="8670914">That is clearly a different analysis, a different type of rule, than the State would bring forward here where they say the question is not has Congress said they... Oklahoma can tax the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.138" offset="8718456">They're trying to advance the theory that the State may tax unless Congress has said they cannot, and as that court has simply said... as the Court has simply said that's--</text>

            <text syncTime="2260.467" offset="9183750">If he bought that piece of property to leave it in the Indian country and, you know, to operate it there... and the good example, the classic example, is the individual who spends the summers in Colorado and works back home during the school year as an educator, for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.480" offset="9251772">If he leaves all his furniture, his car, et cetera on his allotment within the Sac and Fox Indian country during the school year, that's between him and the tribe.</text>
