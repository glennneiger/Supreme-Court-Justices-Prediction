            <text syncTime="71.679" offset="414325">This action involves the boundary between the states of Mississippi, Louisiana, and the private ownership of a body of land known as Stack Island or Island No. 94, patented by the United States as Mississippi land in 1881.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.664" offset="522262">The identity and physical location of this island, which is the only island at issue in this case, can be traced from ancient maps beginning in 1826 through aerial photographs beginning in 1932 through hydrographic, U.S. hydrographic maps up to the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.551" offset="653815">So the island, according to the evidence before the trial court and as the trial court found, has been in existence at least since 1881 and can be identified today.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.096" offset="720062">Now there is no substantial dispute with respect to the applicable boundary law.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.868" offset="755170">This Court has many times said, even in controversies between Louisiana and Mississippi, that the thalweg, that's corrupted in Louisiana and Mississippi to thalweg, of the Mississippi River forms the boundary between the states, and that boundary shifts with gradual shifts in the location.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="239.106" offset="1084104">I know you offered it all, but was your theory in the trial court that the date of admission to the Union was the critical date, and that you tried to find out from the best evidence available what the situation was at that point?</text>

            <text syncTime="279.814" offset="1246899">But no, the principal focus of the argument in the trial court was the controversy in 1881 forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.503" offset="1281694">Now, the second point relating to the boundary issue is the doctrine of acquiescence, also a fact-intensive doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.180" offset="1336342">The trial court found after a review of the conflicting evidence of the experts that the thalweg lay on the west side of the island, and thus under the thalweg rule the island was Mississippi property.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.760" offset="1414710">The trial court also found based on extensive evidence that if the trial court were wrong in that finding that nevertheless the land were Mississippi land because of the doctrine of acquiescence.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.651" offset="1466223">That is of course long assertion of dominion, control, and jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.388" offset="1489211">So we had two basic ultimate fact findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.940" offset="1507392">We had innumerable subsidiary fact findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.944" offset="1535396">We then come to one of the two central points in this case, and that is the Fifth Circuit's exceeding the constraints of Rule 52 and according deference to the trial court's findings of fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="1239.438" offset="5085436">But we have exhibit which is the original survey in 1881 which is adverted to by the trial court and by the Fifth Circuit which clearly shows the thalweg lying to the west of Stack Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.514" offset="5145727">We have exhibit 8, which is the expert testimony of Austin Smith, which locates the thalweg west of Stack Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.620" offset="5186165">We have the Louisiana expert, Mr. Easterly, agreeing, agreeing that this is an appropriate location of the thalweg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.761" offset="5230677">We have the Mississippi River Commission on which the Fifth Circuit, which it finds virtually conclusive, saying that the objective was to bring the thalweg, or main channel as it's called, back to the west of the island, and if it's going to be brought back obviously it has to have been there at some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.441" offset="5313433">Those are examples that more than demonstrate the permissible finding by the trial court that this was Mississippi land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.649" offset="5362230">Furthermore, the trial court buttressed that finding by the finding of acquiescence, and it made the ultimate finding very clearly, that if it was wrong with respect to the thalweg it was right with respect to acquiescence because there had been taxation by Mississippi since 1989, excuse me, 1889, no taxation by Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.716" offset="5466511">There had been foreclosure, there had been sale, there had been exercise of jurisdiction, there had been enforcement of game laws, there had been enforcement of criminal laws, there had been litigation in the courts, nothing, no litigation in the courts regarding this property, there had been an uninterrupted exercise of dominion and control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.147" offset="5552297">This is a pure fact question, and it is a complex fact question, and the trial court heard the evidence on it and it made the finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.854" offset="5591062">Now, the Fifth Circuit disregarded it and it said it was not adequate, but the record itself will demonstrate that the Fifth Circuit was not correctly following this Court's interpretation of the clearly erroneous rule and was ignoring substantial record evidence that supported the trial court's findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.018" offset="5671729">Now, if I may turn briefly to the jurisdiction question, essentially this Court has held, as it well knows, that it has jurisdiction to decline under Article 1251(a) both original and exclusive jurisdiction, and there are a number of cases so holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.483" offset="5773606">And the cases and the conclusion of this Court that it has jurisdiction, correctly based on the fact that its primary function should be to act as the supreme appellate court and that it is ill-equipped to make the fact findings necessary for original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.313" offset="5852914">Now, its findings are consistent with the dictionary definition of the term exclusive, which is the power to exclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.784" offset="5882798">Its findings have been recognized by Congress, that is its discretionary interpretation of 1251, so there can't be a question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.008" offset="5923653">Now, Louisiana agrees essentially that the district court had jurisdiction over Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.214" offset="5964509">It agrees that the district court had jurisdiction over the controversy by virtue of Federal question jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.070" offset="5999931">Now, where it disagrees is that the district court of Mississippi could determine title to land in Louisiana, but in this respect Louisiana position is inconsistent because it asks this Court to reverse and render.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.716" offset="6078507">Certainly the Fifth Circuit could not have had jurisdiction if the district court did not have jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1904.025" offset="7743761">Now, historically what has happened here, and when I began I said the facts do not favor Mississippi, that is because in 1879 Congress for the first time funded massive river construction projects, being the one here at Lake Providence, at Stack Island and at Plum Point about 100 miles north.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.839" offset="7818994">The upshot of that was by 1883, 1884 at the conclusion of the project, the Mississippi River Commission reported to Congress what it had done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.129" offset="7860163">And what it said was, and it attached hydrological data in the form of maps which are in the Appendix attached to Louisiana Exhibit 18A and which are colored to show the Court their importance, the Mississippi River Commission reported to Congress that the east chute channel of the Mississippi River carried the main channel of the river in December of 1881.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.596" offset="7958070">It was scouring the Mississippi bank, it was threatening to erode the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.731" offset="7974579">The Mississippi River Commission saw as its chief purpose here the object of training the river away from Mississippi to keep it from eroding the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.237" offset="8004568">It did that by building a series of dikes out of the north end of Stack Island and connecting to Baleshed Towhead to the north, so that the river was suddenly diverted out of the east chute channel to midstream position.</text>

            <text syncTime="2014.849" offset="8187007">In that report the second part of it is that by 1883 that act had been accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.837" offset="8211040">So in December of 1881 you have the main flow of the river on the east side of the island.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.656" offset="8230266">Within a few months it had been diverted to the outside, toward the right descending bank, and stayed there for about 20 years before it moved slowly back into that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.846" offset="8271017">And it stayed to the east of the island until the 1970's, at which time, as you see from the 1988 map, the Corps got more heavily involved in construction projects, built dikes all along the east side and revetments all along the west side, and has captured a substantial amount of sediment to train the river into a center flow position and to keep it from ambulatory movement back and forth between the east and west banks.</text>

            <text syncTime="2177.539" offset="8837769">Our experts said it said what it said, and the judge tried to get them to admit maybe it meant something different and they said no, it means what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.311" offset="8872878">And that's as simple as it gets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.929" offset="8891373">The petitioners started off their case, now both Louisiana and Mississippi had listed all of their exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.833" offset="8914987">We started with exhibits more at the time of Louisiana's sovereignty and Mississippi's sovereignty, but Mississippi, being the plaintiff in the case, never used those exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.789" offset="8950827">So we responded to their case at trial, didn't put those exhibits on because their theory at trial was the river was subject to two avulsive actions which they said their expert Austin Smith would prove up, and that they occurred sometime around 1912-1913.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.651" offset="9014253">Well, when Mr. Smith testified he only testified about one avulsion which he claimed was due to the flooding of 1912-1913 which he concludes happened because he has some tables of river elevations of that year which he said demonstrated a flood which apparently enlarged the chute channel to the east of Stack Island, meaning that the river boundary and the downstream track of navigation or thalweg would have been frozen to the west of the island.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.305" offset="9144865">But even Mr. Smith only said it apparently enlarged the chute channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.841" offset="9158971">And when I showed him maps prior to the 1912-1913 claimed floods, I showed him maps of 1908, 1909, 1911 from the U.S. Geological Survey, that showed that the channel was already occupied with the main channel of the river, the chute channel, he refused to discuss it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.785" offset="9226785">He said the maps were unwholly and that Louisiana must have rigged those maps up or something to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.689" offset="9254370">So we disproved the northerly avulsion which he really didn't even clearly testify to, and as to the southerly avulsion, which would have the boundary going a couple of miles inland 8 or 9 miles downstream, he had no testimony whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.983" offset="9323542">Then in the Fifth Circuit, after the Fifth Circuit reversed and rendered, the petitioners changed their theory to the time of sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.589" offset="9358024">Certainly the Fifth Circuit was in error in using the 1881-1882 avulsion caused by the Mississippi River Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.528" offset="9393760">The Fifth Circuit should have looked to much earlier periods of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.480" offset="9409538">In our briefing we have pointed out that in all other periods of time Stack Island didn't exist at the claimed relevant time, the time of sovereignty of either state, or at any later time until right up just prior to the Mississippi River construction program, the cause being in this reach of the river, although the alignment is relatively straight, it's a reach of the river that stores sediments from upstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.476" offset="9497518">And you can see even now there is substantial amounts of sediment stored.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.861" offset="9511102">When these become too large I presume the Corps will allow them to go downstream by removing some dikes and revetments, but this reach of the river has always had a lot of movement of shoals and bars and islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.986" offset="9555614">So while Stack Island was in existence prior to the Louisiana sovereignty in the 1700's-1800's, it disappeared by 1812, it reappeared in the 1820's, it disappeared by the 1850's and sixties, and it came back in the late 1860's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.746" offset="9618622">It was a small island near the Mississippi shore, but it was cut off from Mississippi by the main channel of the river, the east chute channel, which the Mississippi River Commission sought to move away from the Mississippi bank and thence the construction project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.374" offset="9681107">So Louisiana's position has been that the east chute channel, being avulsively diverted by the Mississippi River Commission project, created a frozen thalweg to be connected at the north and at the south to the active downstream track of navigation or live thalweg, and that was a position of our experts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.086" offset="9759996">They clearly testified to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.871" offset="9767102">We say that the, at all pertinent times the thalweg was east of the island.</text>

            <text syncTime="2751.934" offset="11135396">I called the United States Fish and Wildlife field agent who is known all over the United States although he's a relatively young man in his thirties, he has exercised jurisdiction all over the accreted area since he has been assigned to this area and said he never saw any Mississippi people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.175" offset="11188372">He said he wrote all his game violations and took them to Federal court in Louisiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="2773.015" offset="11219719">They had grown up there, exercised Louisiana wildlife authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.300" offset="11232885">They never saw any Mississippi people there, wrote all their violations under Louisiana law and Federal law, and took them all to court in Monroe and Shreveport.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.054" offset="11259843">Every witness that we called said that they had never seen any Mississippi people here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.624" offset="11278129">As a practical matter I know that there were people from Mississippi hunting deer out here at different times because there was some testimony to that effect, but it was not generally recognized that they were Mississippi people exercising adverse possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.015" offset="11331732">Now as to the acquiescence argument there is no testimony or evidence of which I am aware that as a sovereign either state dealt with this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.973" offset="11371542">Certainly Louisiana never recognized the sovereignty of Mississippi here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.358" offset="11389097">There was not one single witness to say that Mississippi exercised sovereignty here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.679" offset="11406338">We had such colorful witnesses as Jelly Higgins and Horsefly Higgins for the petitioners, who were their main witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.483" offset="11437580">Now, Jelly and Horsefly said they were acts of adverse possession out here, but I didn't think it was good, strong evidence myself and I pointed that out to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.790" offset="11478853">And I have to say whenever you have a serious case in Federal court if those are your strongest witnesses you've got a problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="2857.752" offset="11558684">First, as the Court can see, this is a case that is highly fact-intensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.120" offset="11580104">There is dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.589" offset="11586060">We dispute what Mr. Keyser has represented to the Court as the facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2872.226" offset="11616571">The trial court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.362" offset="11625139">The nature of the case as such is to validate this Court's exercise of its writ of discretion to let the facts be heard by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.633" offset="11662233">Secondly, as I pointed out to begin with, Stack Island can be traced as a separate body of land from 1826 to date by maps, aerial photographs, and surveys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.262" offset="11732659">There was a controversy before the trial court regarding the disappearance of the island.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.983" offset="11755542">The trial court made a specific fact finding that this island, which has migrated from the Mississippi shore southwesterly to the Louisiana shore, is the same identical island that existed during the 19th century, and that fact finding is fully supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.098" offset="11844045">So--</text>

            <text syncTime="2954.464" offset="11945505">It says in place in 1988 and remained in place throughout the entire period and is still there today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.335" offset="11976956">So there was certainly evidence on which the district court could have rendered its fact finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.489" offset="12005587">And, with respect, we submit that this is not an accretion case at all.</text>
