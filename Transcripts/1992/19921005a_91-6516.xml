            <text syncTime="66.236" offset="384426">The Seventh Circuit decision from which this petition for certiorari is taken is therefore wrong in saying first of all that the law enforcement context of the case is relevant in terms of whether the Fourth Amendment applies, and also is wrong in saying that the Fourth Amendment does not protect possessory interests of persons, and also is wrong in saying that the Fourth, that the privacy rights of my clients in this particular situation were not violated.</text>
