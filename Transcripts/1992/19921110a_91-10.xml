            <label>Mr. James D. Vail</label>
            <text syncTime="58.821" offset="376750">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="70.598" offset="423874">In this case you are asked to reverse the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and to reject the rule first announced in Lessig v. Tidewater Oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.554" offset="467656">You should do for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.737" offset="480403">First, the Lessig rule is inconsistent with this Court's section 2 jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.232" offset="506421">Second, the Lessig rule cannot be reconciled with economic reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.505" offset="527528">And third, the Lessig rule does not promote competition, but harms it.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.688" offset="548217">These are the key facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.750" offset="564518">Spectrum Sports and the McQuillans' distributed Sorbothane athletic insoles; each bought the Sorbothane insoles from a manufacturer and had a... and resold them to retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.539" offset="615613">Each of the parties had an exclusive geographic territory in which they sold the Sorbothane insoles.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.016" offset="645602">Both parties started selling the soles in 1981, and Sorbo, Inc. terminated the McQuillans' distributorship in August, 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.842" offset="688861">Thereafter, Spectrum became the national distributor of Sorbothane insoles.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.298" offset="710699">The trial court entered judgment for the McQuillans on their section 2 claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.551" offset="735672">It also entered judgment on behalf of Spectrum Sports, finding it not to have adjudged... excuse me, finding it not to have violated section 1 in the McQuillans' price fixing claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.879" offset="781021">The appellate court affirmed solely on its conclusion that the trial record supported the McQuillans' attempt to monopolize claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.554" offset="815711">It declined to address any of the other issues that were presented on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.007" offset="833474">The court of appeals relied on the Lessig rule, which permits a judge or a jury to find an attempt to monopolize violation without analyzing the relevant market and determining violation to have occurred based solely on the defendant's conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.258" offset="906513">That rule is inconsistent with the rule of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.781" offset="920619">This Court has long stated that in an attempt to monopolize plaintiff must show that the defendant has a reasonable or dangerous probability of succeeding in monopolizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.978" offset="965445">This is usually proved by examining the relevant market and examining the defendant's power in that market.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.343" offset="990836">Without knowing what the defendant's market power is, a fact finder cannot determine how, if at all, the defendant's conduct will affect a particular market.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.087" offset="1129807">--Our position is that that is not necessarily the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.240" offset="1146421">Without examining the conduct in the context of a relevant market, one cannot determine whether the defendant's conduct will harm competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.154" offset="1186127">One is unable to distinguish between conduct that may be undertaken with the goal of monopolizing from conduct that is undertaken for personal reasons.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="276.005" offset="1245478">You're saying the predatory character of the behavior is not sufficient to do that.</text>

            <label>Mr. James D. Vail</label>
            <text syncTime="279.658" offset="1260106">--That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.210" offset="1270346">First of all, predatory is somewhat difficult to define in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.152" offset="1290095">But moreover, the same conduct might be undertaken by a market player with 2 percent of the market as with... as one who has 80 percent of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.590" offset="1331891">Certainly, the party that has 2 percent of the market is not likely to be able to affect that marketplace and harm competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.814" offset="1360730">There may be some effect on the competitor, but there are other laws to deal with harm to another competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.820" offset="1392808">The Lessig rule converts a section 2, an attempt to monopolize analysis, from one which requires an analysis of the market and the impact on the market to a per se analysis based solely on the defendant's conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.284" offset="1474624">This Court has shown an aversion to extending the per se rule, and that would be... it would be even less appropriate to extend it to a section 2 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.572" offset="1527809">The... the Lessig rule has been rejected by every other court of appeals for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.640" offset="1572008">First, it permits there to be a finding of antitrust, of a section 2 violation, without determining anything more than whether or not the defendant's conduct has been improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.099" offset="1633866">There is no distinction made based on the fact that this is a section 2 analysis which looks at only unilateral conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.115" offset="1665945">The court, the Ninth Circuit, relies solely on the defendant's conduct and permits an inference of specific intent and then--</text>

            <text syncTime="414.355" offset="1798960">The court of appeals, however, found that there... under the Lessig rule there was adequate evidence to support an attempt to monopolize violation and chose not to reach any of the other issues raised on appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="451.692" offset="1948276">It also looked to evidence of what it deemed unfair conduct in which Spectrum Sports stated to Mrs. McQuillan that if she did not sell her distributorship she would be out looking for work.</text>

            <text syncTime="1004.126" offset="4158026">Liability for attempted monopolization in violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act should be limited to conduct that creates a realistic probability of actual monopolization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.284" offset="4206614">The probability of monopolization can be determined only by defining a relevant market and considering the defendant's conduct in the context of that market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.573" offset="4251754">Section 2 of the Sherman Act, unlike section 1, applies to unilateral conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.015" offset="4277563">As this Court recognized in Copperweld, it is often difficult to distinguish robust competition from unilateral conduct with long-run anticompetitive effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.863" offset="4324896">Vigorous competition may seem unfair and predatory to an unsuccessful competitor, but the antitrust laws protect competition, not competitors, and vigorous competition promotes the welfare of consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.592" offset="4383829">The Ninth Circuit's approach to attempted monopolization brings many ordinary business torts within the scope of the Sherman Act with its treble damages remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.531" offset="4427610">Because private antitrust actions are relatively easy to bring and expensive to defend, an overexpansive definition of the attempt defense is likely to chill vigorous competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.478" offset="4479437">Nonantitrust laws are more appropriate vehicles for remedying single firm conduct that does not present a genuine risk of injury to competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.047" offset="4525726">The probability of monopolization can be assessed only by defining a relevant market; that is, a market in which a monopolist could charge a price above the competitive price for a significant period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.805" offset="4584763">In general, a higher market share increases the probability of market power, but market structure is also relevant; factors such as barriers to entry and excess capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.644" offset="4636067">In our view, the probability of monopolization generally should be considered as a threshold issue in a section 2 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.939" offset="4669295">If it is clear from the defendant's market position that there is no significant possibility of monopoly, then judgment for the defendant is appropriate.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey M. Shohet</label>
            <text syncTime="2033.525" offset="8275551">If we could... if we assume that it was simply based on unilateral conduct, the answer would be yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.608" offset="8295927">But we know in this case it was based on concerted conduct, a price-fixing agreement, because that was the only anticompetitive conduct alleged against this petitioner and the jury was instructed that it must find a proximate cause to the anticompetitive conduct and the damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.681" offset="8364263">And the damage in this case was the termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.033" offset="8377638">The only damage we claimed was the termination of the right to distribute Sorbothane.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.996" offset="8393520">That was... the jury found the same damage on each and every antitrust verdict, so the jury found that the termination of the distributor rights was the damage that led to the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.964" offset="8441376">That damage was... that termination was in concert with the manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.989" offset="8457468">Spectrum had no ability, by himself, by itself, to do that conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.420" offset="8479202">Moreover, the jury found in the section 1 case against the other petitioner, the manufacturer, liability on the resale price maintenance claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.427" offset="8515251">And the only reason resale price maintenance was not found against this petitioner was a quirk in the jury instruction, and I would like to address that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.321" offset="8546807">The... the... a central part of the petition was that because the petitioner was exonerated of the section 1 claim, that it had to have been based, the section 2 verdict had to have been based on this general unfair, unkind conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.924" offset="8613158">The resale price maintenance instruction, which is reported at page 4328 of the reporter's transcript, explains quite clearly how the jury found the section 2 verdict, which could only have been supported on a connection with this petitioner to the price fixing agreement, yet exonerated the petitioner on the section 1 claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.627" offset="8692047">That jury was not... that jury instruction was not in error, but it needlessly limited the section 1 offense to a defendant and... to an agreement, excuse me, between a defendant and a distributor of the defendant's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.987" offset="8753487">This petitioner was a defendant, but it did not enter into an agreement with a distributor of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.772" offset="8780550">Its agreement was with the manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.983" offset="8789432">So the manufacturer was found liable but petitioner was not, because of a careful following of the instruction by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.041" offset="8821615">But that certainly does not mean that the conduct underlying that price fixing agreement was not conduct from which the jury could have and must have found the section 2 liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.268" offset="8870516">So, again, we say it was a specific narrow application of the Ninth Circuit's attempt rule because it was predicated on per se unlawful conduct, which, as Justice Connor... O'Connor pointed out, is always manifestly harmful to competition, is never justified, and therefore is a proper basis from which the inference of specific intent required for, at least, the conspiracy charge, and the attempt charge, is proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.135" offset="8982007">And we would submit, under the Ninth Circuit's approach, is also a proper basis from which an inference of dangerous probability should flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.181" offset="9018265">Indeed, on that point, the point that the Court granted certiorari on, the issue presented is whether in every section 2 case, in every attempt to monopolize case, Congress intended the separate offense of attempt to monopolize to require, as a threshold matter in every situation, a market analysis showing virtual monopolization, or whether, as the Ninth Circuit provides, in some limited, very narrow class of cases where the conduct is manifestly anticompetitive and without legitimate procompetitive justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.128" offset="9182000">We can pick up on Justice Holmes' comment in the Swift Premium case and conclude, without a market share screen, that the specific intent and consequent dangerous probability exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.518" offset="9243545">There is no case... and the Walker Process case, Justice Scalia, does not address the dangerous probability element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.263" offset="9270503">It merely recites that it's an element without any analysis, goes on to say that further development in the record below needs to be done in order to... in order to determine whether there should be a per se offense under section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.764" offset="9324524">So it really leaves the question open, if it does anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.937" offset="9333197">So the issue of whether there's a dangerous probability element at all in the attempt defense, or how we should properly prove it, is certainly an issue that this Court is now addressing, essentially, for the first time since 1905.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.103" offset="9385860">The Ninth Circuit rule... I might also add, the screen that the... the Solicitor General proposes, which is the market power screen, is going to give... is not only an expensive impediment and a needless one, but it's going to give us false pos... false negative results in many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.847" offset="9452838">In the circumstance where a proposed monopolist who has the specific intent, as Justice Holmes said, to acquire that power, is engaging in conduct before he has done significant harm to the markets, the screen will show a false negative if we conduct our market power screen, and assuming we can do it perfectly... assuming we can do it perfectly--</text>

            <text syncTime="2413.276" offset="9794624">And it's different because, again, if we accept Justice Holmes' definition of the attempt defense, that when we have specific intent combined with dangerous probability we have dangerous conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2873.411" offset="11635107">The one that was applied in this case was the conduct that is per se unlawful under section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.733" offset="11664469">Indeed, the jury instruction in this case, and it was instruction number... it's reported at page 440 of the supplemental appendix, said that our attempt claim was limited to the exclusionary conduct alleged to violate section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.604" offset="11719953">So there is no question but what the exclusionary conduct in this case was limited by our own claim as set forth in the instruction to the section 1 conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.162" offset="11766137">There's been some criticism that I'd like to address, and that is that the Ninth Circuit's approach collapses the distinction between section 1 and section 2 and permits... and commits... permits liability under section 2 without a manifest harm to the markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.553" offset="11843669">First, with respect to the distinction between section 1 and section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.905" offset="11857148">There is no distinction between section 1 and section 2 based on unilateral versus concerted activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.320" offset="11882748">Section 2, in fact, includes the conspiracy to monopolize offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.023" offset="11905631">So section 2 has concerted activity within its proscription in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.348" offset="11930918">So to suggest that there was some intent by Congress to limit section 2 only to unilateral conduct belies the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.603" offset="11963936">Moreover, what section 2 does address itself to is unilateral and joint conduct in furtherance of monopoly power or in the... the acquisition and maintenance of monopoly power already held, the maintenance of monopoly power already held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.963" offset="12025376">Some of the most effective monopolists and people who are attempting to monopolize are going to do that through joint conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.930" offset="12057246">Joint conduct is the most harmful conduct to the markets, and there's no reason for the Court to develop a rule that simply writes joint conduct out of section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.544" offset="12095698">Indeed, it can't write a rule writing joint conduct out of section 2 because the conspiracy offense is in section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.349" offset="12122865">Moreover, one would... I've heard criticism that if the... if the... if the... if there's a violation of section 1, why have an attempt defense predicated on a per se offense under section 1?</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.978" offset="12181380">Well, this case is one example of why to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.319" offset="12190784">But I think Justice O'Connor made a good point which is that the unconsummated section 1 agreement, and a good example of that was in the American Airlines case where you'll recall the president of American called his counterpoint at Braniff and said let's fix prices, this is killing us, this dangerous cutthroat competition in the airline industry is driving us all crazy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.006" offset="12281481">And the Braniff president promptly hung up and called the Justice Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.987" offset="12297468">The fact is that if a private litigant was either... was injured by that act or was threatened by that act and sought an injunction against it, that litigant ought to be able to go into a Federal court and seek an injunction under section 2 without a showing of market power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.029" offset="12369566">Is there any question that we really need to know anything about the market power of either the individuals or their combined market power after the... the agreement would have been consummated before we're ready to condemn that conduct as threatening monopolization?</text>

            <text syncTime="3192.911" offset="12913122">In other words, the Ninth Circuit has not eliminated the dangerous probability element and it's still a good and viable element under section 2 in the Ninth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3205.019" offset="12961605">In most cases, and the case law under the Ninth Circuit established this... in most cases there is a requirement for a market analysis because we can't know that it's dangerous, we can't form a judgment about it in the ambiguous conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.227" offset="13010402">But where the conduct is unambiguous, why throw the plaintiff out on the street for lack of a market analysis when we can start with the inference that there is market danger and intent, and shift over to the defendant to put on all the market evidence it wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.529" offset="13079574">And, indeed, on a summary judgment, if there's a significant implausibility factor to that position of the plaintiff, these cases are not going to go to the jury.</text>

I'd also like to point out before I conclude that the other instruction... our instructions in this case demonstrated and reflected that balance, because they were limited to the section 1 conduct and they required the jury to... they told the jury that you may infer, but need not infer, this dangerous probability from significantly exclusionary conduct that is destructive of competition and plainly harmful to competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.908" offset="13437138">It specifically admonished the jury that it could not make such an inference from conduct that results from the introduction of a superior product, lower costs, or better business judgment, or hard competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.527" offset="13487607">So the policy inherent in the dangerous probability element, to protect legitimate competition, to protect against the incursion of the antitrust laws to legitimate business... which is why we go through dangerous probability screens and why we're so concerned with the conduct, making sure it harms competition, not competitors... is to protect legitimate competition, which is not at risk under the Ninth Circuit rule because the Ninth Circuit limits the consideration of these cases to conduct that has no procompetitive justification.</text>
