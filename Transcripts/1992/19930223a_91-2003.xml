            <text syncTime="46.513" offset="324602">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="55.439" offset="360337">This Federal common law action for money had and received was brought by the United States to recover $11 million in public funds paid to the State of California as taxes by the manager of the Naval Petroleum Reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.640" offset="425121">The manager is a Federal contractor who operates under an advance-funding, cost-reimbursement arrangement with the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.746" offset="461588">The State taxes were assessed with respect to purchases of personal property made by the manager in the name of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.282" offset="495652">The United States contends that the taxes were erroneously and unlawfully assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.235" offset="515505">The courts below did not reach the question of the legality of the State tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.909" offset="534208">They acknowledged that the United States has a Federal common law right to recover unlawful payments of State taxes, but they held that the Federal cause of action was inapplicable in this case because the United States had not pursued administrative tax refund procedures available under State law and had not brought its judicial challenge to the State tax within the 90 days provided by State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.984" offset="634519">In our view, and in the unanimous view of six other courts of appeals, the Federal common law right of the United States to recover public funds that have been unlawfully obtained is not subject to compliance with the State procedures applicable to State law tax refund suits.</text>

            <text syncTime="142.397" offset="708184">Mr. Jones, is... should we make a distinction in the kinds of unlawfulness that may be appropriate predicates for that common law action?</text>
            <text syncTime="152.384" offset="748099">There was nothing unlawful in the sense of being either criminal or mistaken or tortious.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.289" offset="779759">The unlawfulness here, on your view, is simply an unlawfulness in the sense that if the taxability issue were litigated as far as it could be litigated on the merits, the United States would win and California would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.579" offset="840886">But should we distinguish between those two senses of unlawful?</text>
            <text syncTime="179.801" offset="857813">And if we do, are you in trouble under the common law action?</text>

            <text syncTime="183.764" offset="873591">Well, there is no basis, or rationale even, for distinguishing in that sense, Justice Souter.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.940" offset="910267">The common law action for money had and received was designed by this Court to protect the United States, to prevent and remedy unlawful takings of public monies.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.457" offset="956347">Whether... or the way that it seems most direct to state it is that under Federal common law, if Federal funds have been taken without lawful justification, they must be returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.676" offset="1005248">It is for the person who has taken the funds to establish the lawful basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.291" offset="1031684">In this case, the State of California proposes that the lawful basis for its taking of the funds is the State tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.864" offset="1061986">Our position is that the State tax law does not provide a lawful basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.706" offset="1081421">We would take the same position with respect to other takings of public property with respect to which we think there is no lawful justification.</text>

            <text syncTime="1297.792" offset="5329768">If the... I take it the premise of that question is there are two causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.628" offset="5357039">The United States has its Federal cause of action; the United States also, under the State's theory, could be subrogated to the State law cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.843" offset="5389954">The answer to your question turns on the character of the State statute of limitations, at least that's what the Ninth Circuit has held in a series of cases not at issue here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.900" offset="5430182">The Ninth Circuit has suggested that when the State statute incorporates the limitations period as an element of the cause of action, then compliance with the State statute of limitations is necessary to give rise to the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.999" offset="5494548">We think it apparent... although that issue isn't presented here, we think it apparent that this State statute of limitations does not incorporate compliance with the State period as an element of the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.330" offset="5547838">To the contrary, what the State statute of limitations says is that failure to bring suit within 90 days will be deemed to constitute a waiver of the State claim, so it is a traditional or more traditional State statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.308" offset="5611786">So the short answer to your question is if we had proceeded under State law, we would not be subject to the State statute of limitations, the 6-year Federal statute of limitations would apply, but the case hasn't been presented on that basis in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.380" offset="5676047">The State's argument takes a somewhat different tack.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.783" offset="5705722">They don't join the contention that we should be required to exhaust a nonexisting remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.508" offset="5724634">They instead contend that we should be required to resort to the State process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.072" offset="5746891">For the reasons I've already described, that conflicts with well established rules requiring Federal rules to govern Federal actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.938" offset="5794329">But I should also point out that it would make the public right of the United States to recover public funds turn on the perseverance of Federal contractors who ultimately have no stake in the outcome, and who operate under an enormous variety of tax procedures in literally thousands of local taxing jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.583" offset="5876876">In Clearfield Trust the Court concluded that because United States transactions proceed upon such a vast scale, the Federal right should not be subjected to the exceptional uncertainties imposed by the vagaries of the State law rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="2736.757" offset="11085588">The Department of Employment case was a case that refused to apply the Tax Injunction Act as to State taxes because a Federal instrumentality was being taxed in violation of its sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.666" offset="11145252">That rule does not apply in this case because WBEC was not a Federal instrumentality and there's no issue of sovereign immunity.</text>

State tax law was involved, it's California's position that even Federal instrumentalities must be required to pursue State remedies before seeking relief in the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.071" offset="11294881">There are three cases at least, and maybe more, that... I've put down... I've put three cases that the United States has cited that fall into this category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.497" offset="11328527">The United States v. Benton, United States v. Broward County, and United States v. DeKalb County all involve issues of application of tax... State tax law only and there are no Supremacy Clause issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.898" offset="11398117">And California believes that to the extent that these cases stand for the proposition that State remedies need not be pursued, they are wrongly decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="3121.900" offset="12626186">All the other cases... all the cases, besides the three I mentioned, relied upon by the United States involve Supremacy Clause issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.408" offset="12676236">And in that sense... and that situation is the only time that the courts allow the United States to go directly to the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.527" offset="12716674">Those issues are not present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.967" offset="12726391">The Clearfield Trust case also would not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.020" offset="12746662">The Clearfield Trust was a response to this Court's decisions in Erie v. Tompkins and Hinterleiter v. LaPlada.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.367" offset="12784070">Those two cases stand for the proposition that Federal courts can invoke Federal common law to protect the interests of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.751" offset="12817611">However, the application of that rule has some conditions precedent which aren't present... which have not been discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.848" offset="12853973">One is that this Court has held that when the United States and a State are the parties, then the interests of both governments must be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.735" offset="12897546">And when you consider the interests of State government, the principle of comity also comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.860" offset="12925967">That was the Board of Commissioners v. the United States, 308 U.S. 343, 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.325" offset="12951880">Also, this Court has stated that the invoking of Federal common law is usually applied in situations where a Federal rule is necessary to protect uniquely Federal interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.854" offset="13013947">There's no uniquely Federal interest in this case that needs protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.328" offset="13035890">Third, in determining whether to apply common law, this Court has held that a guiding principle is a significant conflict between the use of State law and Federal interest or policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.719" offset="13101405">And as the Ninth Circuit held in this case, there is no such conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.332" offset="13119900">The United States does not have a quasi-contract cause of action, although up to this point I've been assuming it had, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.048" offset="13162741">First, the Ninth Circuit was correct in holding there has been no unjust enrichment of California as that term is used in the quasi-contract action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.547" offset="13212791">How can California be unjustly enriched when WBE... State court actions could have resolved every State law issue in this case, including whether taxes were overpaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.865" offset="13265977">California cannot be unjustly riched... enriched at the expense of the United States when the United States directed and controlled the State court actions and failed to bring the suits to trial within 5 years and directed WBEC to dismiss the actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.437" offset="13332328">The second reason that the United States has no quasi-contract cause of action in this case is that the United States as a subrogee can invoke only those remedies of WBEC, and WBEC did not have a remedy of a quasi-contract action in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3368.692" offset="13613301">The United States' claim in this case is based entirely upon California tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.839" offset="13657918">And like this Court's decision in United States v. Dalm, the United States... the California tax law requires the filing of a claim for refund and the filing of a suit within 90 days of the notice of denial of the claim for refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.267" offset="13711626">WBEC did go through this procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.683" offset="13733255">Notice of denials were made and it filed suit within 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.114" offset="13751018">However, because it's a part of the California accrual of a cause of action under a waiver of sovereign immunity, once the dismissals were made WBEC's actions... claim against the State of California were extinguished by operation of law when the dismissals were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.458" offset="13828341">The Ninth Circuit said that a dismissal means those cases were never filed, and if the WBEC cases were never filed no case was filed within the 90 days of the notice of denial of WBEC's claim for refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.708" offset="13893438">So the United States can make no claim against California either as a taxpayer, because it did not file a claim for refund, or as a subrogee of WBEC.</text>

            <text syncTime="3456.119" offset="13963028">But can you bring a suit for money had and received as subrogee?</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.621" offset="13977030">I mean the question we'd accepted is whether invoking... in invoking the Federal cause of action for money had and received, the United States must comply with the State law requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.157" offset="14019139">Can you do that when you're a subrogee?</text>

            <text syncTime="3472.120" offset="14027080">--I don't... in this case I don't believe so because WBEC had no such action and a subrogee just takes the remedies of the subrogor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.686" offset="14061353">So the United States reliance on the Summerlin case is misplaced because it fails to distinguish between a statute... State statute of limitations depriving the United States of a preexisting valid claim and the conditions precedent to an accrual of a cause of action under a waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.249" offset="14151528">The first question for Summerlin and Summerlin analysis is is there a valid cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.014" offset="14170649">If there's no valid cause of action, then you never get to the second element of Summerlin, the deprival... depriving of the United States of a cause of... of a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.389" offset="14208161">Even if you assume that during the pendency of the State court actions that WBEC filed the United States had a valid claim, that claim was not denied by statute of limitations, that claim was denied by the voluntary dismissal of those cases under direction of the United States.</text>
