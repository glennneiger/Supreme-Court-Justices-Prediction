            <text syncTime="14.424" offset="189297">Section 1915(a) permits persons to proceed in forma pauperis upon the filing of a proper affidavit of indigency.</text>

            <text syncTime="43.177" offset="304236">Prior to 1959, the in forma pauperis statute was limited to citizens, and prior to 1959, the case law is perfectly unequivocal.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.420" offset="361288">Those citizens were only natural persons.</text>

            <text syncTime="84.368" offset="469017">Consequently, there was some discretion in... according them various privileges such as the in forma pauperis.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.307" offset="500781">The Second Circuit in two cases held that they were not to be afforded the benefits of the in forma pauperis statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.150" offset="552190">Therefore, up to 1959, the application of the plaintiff in the court below would have been summarily rejected.</text>

            <text syncTime="146.457" offset="717389">But in 1959, Congress, with the explicit, singular, and unequivocal intention of according the benefit of in forma pauperis to resident aliens and resident aliens alone substituted for the word, citizen, in the in forma pauperis statute the term, person.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.870" offset="807041">Then for a period from '59 to '69, utterly no litigation at all on the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.428" offset="849255">What this would indicate to me, in sum, is number one, the statute, whether referring to citizen or to person, never referred to artificial persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.288" offset="908710">It only referred to natural persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.057" offset="919786">Secondly, in the amendment in 1959, the language is we would extend the same privilege as is now afforded citizens to resident aliens.</text>

            <text syncTime="1216.763" offset="4998649">--Well, Your Honor, the... section 1 was amended in I believe 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.601" offset="5017980">Section 1915 was amended in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.786" offset="5030728">But I would point out that 1 year before in 1958, this Court decided the case of United States v. A&amp;P Trucking, and in that case, this Court was interpreting a criminal statute that used the phrase, whoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.276" offset="5084644">Whoever, is defined, along with the word, person, in 1 U.S.C., section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.180" offset="5104288">This Court construed the phrase, whoever, to include partnerships because partnerships were included in the section 1 definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.436" offset="5133337">So, just one year before section 1915 was amended, this Court decided a case applying Section 1 to construe a Federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.226" offset="5168445">And it makes sense for Congress to define standard terms in section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.844" offset="5186940">That saves Congress from redefining those terms every time a new bill is passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.314" offset="5204808">But Congress can only rely upon the definitions in section 1 if this Court is willing to make those definitions mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.401" offset="5237199">The petitioners' claim here is that Congress was silent regarding whether an association may proceed in forma pauperis, but I would suggest the Congress spoke loud and clear in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.859" offset="5282966">In amending section 1915(a), Congress deliberately used the word, person, and Congress chose that word knowing that the word, person, has a specific standard statutory meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.017" offset="5331658">The petitioners want that phrase, person, in section 1915 to be read as natural persons, but if Congress had wanted only natural persons to proceed in forma pauperis, it would have said so in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.260" offset="5380559">The statute would have said that natural persons can proceed in forma pauperis or that individuals can proceed in forma pauperis or that citizens and aliens can proceed in forma pauperis, or Congress would have taken the time to craft a specific definition of the word, person, just as Congress has done in a variety of other statutory schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.822" offset="5458822">But Congress didn't do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.424" offset="5465301">It used the word, person, which has a standard statutory definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.792" offset="5478780">Now, the petitioners rely quite a lot on the legislative history to the amendment to section 1915(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.064" offset="5515874">In response to an earlier question, I'd point out that the Senate report, which is republished in the U.S. Code and Congressional News, I think also reprints the House report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.235" offset="5548475">It contains it in great detail so that the legislative reports from the two chambers are reproduced there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.407" offset="5573239">And those reports do not say that person means only natural persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.561" offset="5597794">There's a paragraph that's two sentences long that's entitled Purpose, and all that it says is that the purpose of the amendment is to change the word, citizen, to the word, persons.</text>

            <text syncTime="1475.533" offset="6033725">There is Department of Energy v.

            <text syncTime="1490.023" offset="6091612">And there the Court compared the use of the word, sanction, in several different subsections of the particular enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.910" offset="6115227">So, I'd suggest that was an example of a court looking at the overall text of the statute to decide context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.433" offset="6141350">And here I'd suggest that context, thus, refers to the overall text of the statute and not to a legislative history.</text>

            <text syncTime="2358.879" offset="9567048">And I don't really that this is something which will come up much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.748" offset="9578541">I mean, frankly, the Southern District of New York decided the Harlem River case 15 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.484" offset="9597454">In that case, the district court held that associations and corporations are persons within the meaning of the in forma pauperis statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.471" offset="9625457">I think this Court can take note of the fact that the Southern District of New York is a district which has quite a number of corporations and associations, and yet, since the Harlem River case, no case has reached the Second Circuit on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.196" offset="9672373">There's no other reported case in the Southern District of New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="2391.350" offset="9696928">Also, I would point out that if organizations are bringing lawsuits on behalf of individuals, it may well be that there would be a reduction of litigation in the Federal court because an association suit may replace suits of many individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.542" offset="9753771">So, first, I don't know that this is something which will cause a problem for the courts, and I don't know that it will come up very often at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.513" offset="9781670">I'd also like to point out the in forma pauperis statute, section 1915, doesn't even give guidelines as to... assess the indigency of individuals, and yet, the courts have managed to fashion their own rules to determine when individuals can proceed in forma pauperis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.040" offset="9839766">And the courts have developed that jurisprudence and have not had difficulty in developing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.427" offset="9857320">And I'd suggest that the courts, if associations or corporations do occasionally sue under this in forma pauperis statute in the future, will have no difficulty developing that jurisprudence either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.119" offset="9924089">I know that the petitioners have suggested that legislative history means context and that the Court ought to look to legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.459" offset="9953451">I'd suggest that context means overall text and purpose of a statute, and that if this Court looks to the legislative history in this case, it does it for the same reasons that the Court ordinarily looks to legislative history, and that is if the statute is deemed ambiguous in any respect or if there is an argument that interpreting the statute literally would frustrate the intent of the legislators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.158" offset="10048223">I think that the language of the statute is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.877" offset="10059090">The statute is not ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.561" offset="10069852">Section 1915 says that persons may proceed in forma pauperis, and 1 U.S.C., section 1 says that persons include associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.750" offset="10102558">So, it's not an ambiguous statute and one should not look to the legislative history under that... for that reason.</text>
