            <text syncTime="14.870" offset="203897">This case arises from a railroad crossing accident in which respondent's husband died.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.464" offset="226258">Every one of these crossing accidents is a serious matter, and when the number of accidents reached the thousands with the increase in highway traffic, this became a matter of national concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.410" offset="277980">Congress faced up to this problem in the Federal Safety Act of 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.377" offset="297938">It authorized the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations and standards for all areas of railroad safety and it directed the Secretary to undertake a coordinated effort toward solutions to the grade crossing problem under his authority under both the Railway Safety Act and the highway legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.760" offset="379440">Congress went further.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.649" offset="386963">It directed that the Secretary's regulations shall be nationally uniform, and Congress provided a sweeping preemption provision as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.911" offset="428027">A State may adopt or continue in force any law, regulation, order, or standard relating to railroad safety until such time as the Secretary has adopted a rule, regulation, order, or standard covering the subject matter of such State requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="100.165" offset="545056">It passed a highway safety act in which the States were required to survey all highway rail crossings and implement improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.505" offset="578388">Now, as authorized and directed by Congress, the Secretary has issued many, many regulations, and many of those include safety at grade crossings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1439.215" offset="5901203">This is the first time in 20 years that this Court has had an opportunity to interpret the preemptive scope of the FRSA, and we'd like to make three basic points about how we think that it needs to be interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.320" offset="5949686">And the first is that we share the view of the parties that 434 should not be interpreted to preempt common law tort actions against railroads for violations of their duties to operate trains in a safe manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.048" offset="6008618">Second, we think that it is also important, however, to recognize that under the language when the Secretary has covered the subject matter of a railroad's duty, that standard of care must govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.745" offset="6071417">It is a Federal standard of care defining the railroad's... the content of the railroad's safety obligations under the circumstances that must control in this case and in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.492" offset="6114362">So, the critical question becomes whether, in fact, the Secretary has covered the subject matter of the particular claims that are at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.411" offset="6146022">As to those claims, on the grade crossing issue, we do not think that the regulations cover the subject matter of these claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="2268.039" offset="9216560">Then to ensure even more that State law wouldn't be arbitrarily displaced, they included the local safety hazard exception, which says States may adopt rules, regulations that the Secretary has already covered when there's a local safety hazard and it's not incompatible with the Federal rule and it's not an undue burden on interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="3486.411" offset="14090068">I'd like to devote that entirely to the confusion on Federal funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.348" offset="14105742">The States, as everybody knows, get a lot of Federal money for all kinds of purposes on the highways, and the States accept certain responsibilities to get all that money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.500" offset="14150359">And one of them is, imposed in the 1973 act, each State shall conduct and maintain a survey of all highways, to identify rail crossings which may require separation or protective devices, and establish and implement a schedule of projects for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.416" offset="14214098">States have done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.790" offset="14223502">They haven't objected to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.915" offset="14228099">They're doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.399" offset="14229980">The Federal funds it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.210" offset="14233219">And my point is that quite apart from this myopic view on part 646, that this requirement is now embraced not only in the statute, but also in the Federal regs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.861" offset="14283792">It's in 924.</text>

            <text syncTime="3538.594" offset="14298734">These are regulations and they trigger the preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.484" offset="14310333">The manual, which counsel for the Solicitor General said, oh, that's a mere bulletin... it is a regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.590" offset="14338754">It's in the CFR, and the R stands for regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.948" offset="14352233">It's described in the CFR as a regulation and a standard, and it specifically puts the responsibility for this narrow question of who determines gates or no gates on the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.474" offset="14402284">Period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.427" offset="14406150">And once they do that, 434 kicks in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.754" offset="14419420">Having covered that narrow subject matter, not liability generally at grade crossings... we'll keep getting sued every time there's an accident, but as to this determination, the Secretary has covered that subject matter and that preempts expressly.</text>
