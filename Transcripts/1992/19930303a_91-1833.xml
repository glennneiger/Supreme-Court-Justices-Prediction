            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="53.265" offset="352906">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="57.118" offset="368266">Respondents brought this suit to challenge a 1985 decision by the Indian Health Service to redirect the work of a group of its employees from a regional to a national effort to promote the availability of diagnostic and related services for handicapped Indian children.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.120" offset="448305">The employees' work was funded by a lump sum appropriation from Congress for the Indian Health Service and its 12,000 employees, 50 hospitals, 150 health centers, and 300 health clinics.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.201" offset="508595">The funds were authorized by the Snyder Act, the comprehensive statute that authorizes Indian appropriations generally, and by the Indian Health Services Improvement Act which from time to time has provided supplemental funds to address specific areas of Congress' concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.754" offset="582783">This case presents two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.346" offset="597203">First, whether judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act of the... of an agency's allocation of funds from one concededly authorized purpose to another is barred because it is committed to agency discretion by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.455" offset="657598">And second, whether formal rule-making procedures, consisting of a published notice in the Federal Register and opportunity for comment, is required before the Indian Health Service could redirect its resources in the manner that respondents challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.506" offset="717784">We submit that the answer to both questions is no, or that the court of appeals erred on both questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.369" offset="745265">On the first, the court of appeals acknowledged that the Snyder Act and the Indian Health Service Act do not provide manageable standards for a court to apply in reviewing the Indian Health Service's action here.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.438" offset="801585">Nor does the Lump Sum Appropriations Statute furnish any such law.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.923" offset="819453">It's simply, as is typical of such statutes, a lump sum for all of the authorized activities of the statutes... or of the agency under the statutes that authorize its basic functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.649" offset="862398">The court of appeals instead concluded that certain statements in the legislative history of the Lump Sum Appropriations Statute furnished a basis for judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.985" offset="899701">In our view that is clearly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.937" offset="911508">Statements in legislative history are simply not law for a court to apply within the meaning of this Court's APA jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.944" offset="943587">Only statutory texts enacted by Congress is law for a court to apply.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="206.528" offset="965947">You... you have a text here which is, you know, a certain amount of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.898" offset="983397">And you don't... it doesn't... you don't know what that money's supposed to be used for, and this legislative history clarifies what it's to be used for.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.377" offset="1025298">Why is that any different from a piece of legislative history that clarifies the meaning of a prohibition?</text>
            <text syncTime="226.800" offset="1047031">It's totally ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.172" offset="1052465">You'd think the agency can take a number of different views of what it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.644" offset="1070333">If you find it clarified in the legislative history, that's what it means.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="237.008" offset="1087782">That's... that's not the purpose for which the court of appeals used the language in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.551" offset="1101993">It did not focus on language in the Lump Sum Appropriations statute itself and then say that the legislative history helped to clarify the statutory text.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.666" offset="1134489">The court really used the legislative history as a substitute for the statutory text.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.760" offset="1150790">The statutory text here simply authorizes the agency to expend the funds for purposes authorized by the... by the Snyder Act as... those functions transferred to the Indian Health Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.247" offset="1196765">It's then necessary to look to the Snyder Act or the Indian Health... Indian Health statute to look for any law to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.875" offset="1239293">And the... the Snyder Act, for example, and the court of appeals, again, didn't find anything in the text of the... of the Snyder Act or the Indian Health Care Improvement Act that would furnish law to apply in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.341" offset="1281193">The Snyder Act, as this Court pointed out in Morton v. Ruiz, is deliberately comprehensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.875" offset="1303345">It was enacted in response to the... the time when points of order were raised against Indian appropriations because there was no authorizing statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.879" offset="1395296">But there... I don't there can be any question here that the reallocation or redirection of the work that the Indian Health Service made in this case was authorized by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.464" offset="1429673">It simply redirected the employees' work from a regional... regionally focused program to a national program, to assure available services for Indian children.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.872" offset="1471260">There's... I think that's unquestionably within the broad language of the... of the Snyder Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="344.109" offset="1516191">Respondents have not contended that the... that the... use... utilizing the employees... what was going to be done here, essentially... let me just back up for a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.986" offset="1555792">The employees under this Indian children's program in... or project in... in the Southwest was really set up as a pilot project.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.304" offset="1597066">It wasn't even integrated into the local Indian health care delivery system.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.246" offset="1612739">It was operated out of headquarters as a pilot project to really investigate what... what might be done in what was thought to be perhaps an under utilized area.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.163" offset="1652445">But the... but the ultimate point was to develop data and approaches for a nationwide program.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.315" offset="1673030">And so when... when the Indian Health Service redirected the activities of the employees, the thought was that rather than have these employees do monthly consultations... consultative visits with individual children, it would be better to try to develop local responsibility for the Indian children from local programs and have these employees use their expertise to go to other Indian Health Service areas around the country to help them develop the local expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.701" offset="1774594">But I don't think there's... there can be any question and I don't understand respondents' to claim that the utilization of the employees for this nationwide effort is somehow beyond the... the scope of what the Snyder Act or the Indian Health Care Act would authorize.</text>

            <text syncTime="2062.228" offset="8388693">And so these teams traveled out into the Indian communities, into reservation areas, areas that were remote, that were rural, that were isolated and oftentimes small, and provided these diagnostic and treatment services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.721" offset="8450656">What's also important to understand is that throughout the operation of this program every year in testimony to the congressional committees regarding appropriations, the agency continuously told the agency, this is a critical program for these children, it's a successful program, we are providing these specific diagnostic and treatment services to them, certain children are eligible for these services and we want continued funding for this program.</text>

            <text syncTime="2162.986" offset="8791711">Sometime in 1985... the record is not clear as to exactly when this decision was made, but sometime in 1985 the decision was made to eliminate the Indian Children's Program as a direct service program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.317" offset="8857017">This termination decision was announced in a letter in August of 1985.</text>

            <text syncTime="2640.599" offset="10702202">In a case called Heckler v. Chaney we decided that there was no law to apply, to basis for a cause of action against an agency asserting that it had to exert its enforcement priorities in this manner rather than in another manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.293" offset="10780987">We said there are lot of different manners it can use; it's up to the agency to decide where to devote its limited enforcement resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.917" offset="10811498">Now, why doesn't that principle carry over very well to... to an agency that's in the disbursement of benefits business?</text>

            <text syncTime="2744.920" offset="11119430">And that's the notice and comment requirement that comes in under Morton v. Ruiz.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.394" offset="11149418">And even if there insufficient funds and their... and the agency has to do this reallocation, it has to be done in such a way that it's fair to the children.</text>

            <text syncTime="2772.978" offset="11231756">I would add that it's... it seems illogical and totally incomprehensible that when the agency has a specific mandate under the Snyder Act, a mandatory requirement that it act with respect to Indians to conserve health, that they not at least, when they're... when they're abruptly terminating these services, to give them notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.285" offset="11340948">Notice, just as a matter of general common sense, would have been proper here, and something that would have assisted them in maintaining their health.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.614" offset="11382222">It might be similar when we get... those... those of us here who are covered by private health insurance, we would be... feel very unfairly treated if... if the coverer simply dropped the... the coverage that we have without telling us, or changed a provision in the coverage without telling us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.965" offset="11459649">If the children had known ahead of time, if they had been given notice, they could have at least have attempted to locate and find those alternative services that the Government says was readily available, to make some sort of a transition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.397" offset="11529343">Without that transition, they fell into... fell between the cracks; there was a gap of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.930" offset="11551495">And the record is very clear on that point, that loss of services to these type of children harms them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.595" offset="11586186">The type of treatment services that they need you cannot accumulate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3231.086" offset="13064194">And the agency must, in order to make this decision in a manner that is not arbitrary and capricious, do so in a way that's adequately informed, that considers all the relevant factors and provides a reasoned explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.155" offset="13120409">And finally, we are asserting, of course, that this action was directly contrary to the law, particularly the Snyder Act... this goes directly contrary to its requirement that the agency take actions which conserve health... and also the Indian Health Care Improvement Act requirement that they maintain and improve and try to achieve the highest possible health status for these children.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="3309.681" offset="13378499">There are a couple points I wanted to make on each of the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.153" offset="13392396">First, on the notice and comment issue, on the question of... of individualized notice which counsel for respondents mentioned, it's important to bear in mind that the Indian Health Service was not the primary provider of care in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.634" offset="13446313">It was always a backup or secondary consultative role that IHS personnel were performing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.397" offset="13469405">The children involved had primary care givers and the Indian Health Service did give individualized notice to the primary care givers and held community meetings to assist them in developing alternative resources, which was the sort of approach appropriate to the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.968" offset="13531681">In addition, notice and comment is not well suited to obtaining the input of the Indian people in a circumstance such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.424" offset="13565536">But neither Congress nor the Indian Health Service has been indifferent to the need to get input, but they've chosen a different way, which was... which was a system of consultation with the tribes concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.791" offset="13610989">I've mentioned the... the consultation with tribes that Congress required for facility alterations in the 1988 amendments which are in 25 USC 1631, but in addition the amicus brief of six tribes in this case cites several documents which describe the Indian Health Service's broader system of consultation through a national health board, through health boards at the local level for the various clinics, and consultations with the tribes concerned about the delivery of services on their reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.240" offset="13736795">That is the form of consultation and input that is appropriate to the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.174" offset="13752468">It's also appropriate to the Indian Health Service's mission, which is one from a public health perspective, not one of individual entitlement to... to medical services, but a public health service which requires them to look at the big picture and mortality rates and where... where services are needed in the main.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.034" offset="13827910">On the question of what's committed to agency... that this is committed to agency--</text>

            <text syncTime="3451.804" offset="13947028">--Informal action, yes, I think that's necessarily so, or... or agencies would be hamstrung.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.260" offset="13968867">On the question of committed to agency discretion, it's... I want to emphasize again several points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.782" offset="13986943">One, the statements in the committee reports have long been... on Appropriations Acts have long been understood by the GAO, I think by Congress itself, and by executive agencies, not to be intended to create binding legal obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.739" offset="14034800">And to change that understanding of those sorts of exchanges in the appropriations process would, in GAO's view and the executive branch's view, change that process radically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.906" offset="14079417">Also, on the question of what is... when something is committed to agency discretion by law, it's important to bear in mind that whether there's law to apply is just one way of getting at that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.222" offset="14116720">There are other factors in... that this Court has recognized, including whether the issue is one that's traditionally been regarded as committed to agency discretion, which the allocation of appropriated funds is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.578" offset="14158098">And also whether there would be unduly disruptive consequences of allowing judicial review, and for the reasons I've described there clearly would be here, because it would subject numerous myriad decisions of the Indian Health Service and the administration of this vast program to the potential for judicial review on basis of facts or disagreement about the ordering of priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.443" offset="14241585">Which brings me to the last point on that, and that is directly tied to Heckler v. Chaney, as Justice Scalia mentioned, that this is a case going to the core of the allocation of scarce agency resources among the various demands on the agency's time and energy, and that is, again, necessarily something committed to agency discretion.</text>
