            <text syncTime="53.375" offset="339516">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="56.708" offset="352786">This case is here from the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.491" offset="367937">That court held that in respondent's trial for first degree murder, the jury must never know that he voluntarily confessed to the crime after receiving Miranda warnings and expressly waiving his rights because 5 months before confessing, he invoked his right to counsel when he was arrested on an unrelated drug charge, a charge he resolved with a guilty plea 3 months before being questioned about the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.877" offset="469501">The decision of the court of appeals should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.898" offset="481622">The facts are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.981" offset="489876">Respondent was arrested on a drug charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.623" offset="500534">He was read his Miranda rights by the book.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.984" offset="509939">He invoked his right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.965" offset="517880">The police immediately stopped the proceedings, and respondent was provided with an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.130" offset="538464">2 months later, he pled guilty to a lesser drug charge as part of a plea bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.712" offset="564796">3 months after that, he was... while still in custody, he was arrested for murder, a charge unrelated to the drug offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.618" offset="600427">He was again read his Miranda rights, and this time he chose to waive them, giving the police a videotaped statement in which he confessed to his role in the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.014" offset="638043">The lower courts reluctantly suppressed the confession, even though they found it voluntary and found respondent's waiver knowing and intelligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.241" offset="674928">They thought this result compelled by this Court's decision in Edwards against Arizona and the rule that once a suspect invokes his right to counsel, the police may not reinitiate questioning, and if they do, the suspect's statements are presumed to be involuntary.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.112" offset="866458">This Court has never had occasion to consider whether the Edwards presumption continues in the face of a guilty verdict, let alone a guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.877" offset="897491">In Edwards, in Roberson, and in Minnick, the subject was in the same position when he invoked his right to counsel as when the police reinitiated questioning, a pretrial suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.014" offset="938033">Here, however, in the meantime, the respondent has been found guilty on the matter that led to his arrest and on which he... which triggered his Miranda rights in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="1184.169" offset="4862670">People in custody are a very valuable investigative resource for the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.604" offset="4884404">Not only have they often committed other crimes themselves, but often have information about who has committed other crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.798" offset="4909168">The question posed by Edwards to the police officer is, can I question this individual who's in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.920" offset="4933723">People arrive at custody by very circuitous routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.263" offset="4946993">It's not unusual for a defendant to be arrested in California, detained and questioned there, transferred to New York, detained and questioned there by different authorities, and then transferred to Illinois to await trial on still different charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.753" offset="5001014">A police officer in Illinois may know nothing more than that the individual is in custody and may have information about an offense that he's investigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.129" offset="5034556">Now, what does the officer have to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.560" offset="5044273">The officer, under the supposedly clear guidance of Edwards, has to find out if the individual has ever invoked his right to counsel, anytime, anyplace before any authorities, whether he has been continuously in custody since that time, whether at any time he has initiated contact with the police and thereby waived his previous invocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.652" offset="5124626">And the answers to those questions don't follow the prisoner around on a card.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.306" offset="5143225">They may be with the State officials in California, the bail officer in Illinois, with the FBI in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.830" offset="5169347">And the reason it is important that there be clear guidance to the police... we think our rule provides clear guidance... is that these people have oftentimes valuable information about other crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.527" offset="5220130">Our submission today would put a reasonable parameter on what the officer has to ask.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.822" offset="5245312">If he finds out that the defendant is there because he has pled guilty or been found guilty, then the officer doesn't need to go back beyond that in this little mini-investigation he must conduct before even approaching the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.942" offset="5297765">And keep in mind that the first thing the officer says when he approaches is not tell us about this murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.205" offset="5318768">It is, you have the right to have an attorney present before answering any of my questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.908" offset="5341651">Now, the one thing that a suspect in respondent's position knows from experience and is reminded of by the second administration of the rights is that that right will be respected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.305" offset="5387209">That is why this case is very different from Edwards, where he was not allowed to consult with his attorney, and also very different from Roberson where 3 days went by and he was not allowed to consult with his attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.943" offset="5433811">It's also different from Minnick because there, although he was allowed to consult with his attorney, the second approach concerned the same offense, and a very short period of time, only 3 days, had elapsed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.173" offset="5486683">And again, as in Edwards, the suspect was told he had to talk to the police when he refused to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.257" offset="5511029">In all of those cases, Edwards, Roberson, and Minnick, there was a very real concern, the Court concluded, that the suspect would reasonably think that the Miranda rights he was being given were not real.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.754" offset="5557005">If the police keep coming back to the suspect after he invokes his rights, he could decide they don't mean it when they say I have these various rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.626" offset="5584485">That's not a plausible concern on the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.631" offset="5600472">If there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2472.727" offset="10016943">I think it's important to remember exactly what it is that we're suggesting today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.282" offset="10043170">It is not that when there is a finding of guilt or, we think in particular, a guilty plea, police may now presume that the suspect is willing to talk to them without his attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.330" offset="10083294">All we're saying is that the facts have changed to such an extent that it is reasonable to once again regard that question as an open question, and the first thing that the suspect will be reminded of is that he has a right not to talk to the police without his attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.609" offset="10148391">If he still... given the change in the situation, if he still does not wish to talk to the police without an attorney, all he has to do is say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.135" offset="10182559">It worked the last time, and he knows it will work again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.397" offset="10195620">In other words, the deck has been reshuffled, he has been dealt a new hand, and there's no reason to presume that his opening bid is going to be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.193" offset="10226758">That's why we think it is the finding of guilt and the guilty plea that is a sufficient change in circumstances that justifies reopening the question once again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.830" offset="10273361">With respect to the difference between the guilty plea and sentencing, under the Sixth Amendment, he cannot be interrogated for information to be used at sentencing on the drug charge, and under... because it is not custodial interrogation, questioning by a court official... that's why the warnings are not given... the Edwards presumption doesn't apply in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.635" offset="10372521">That's why we think it is the guilty plea, the guilty verdict, rather than sentencing that is a determining factor.</text>
