            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="134196">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 91-998, Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Nader E. Soliman.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.706" offset="181007">Mr. Jones.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="14.926" stopTime="152.214">
            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="14.926" offset="193860">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.045" offset="206294">Home office expenses are a conceptual hybrid of business expenses, which are generally deductible, and personal expenses, which generally are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.250" offset="247149">Prior to 1976 most courts concluded that the expenses of a home office may be deducted if the office was appropriate and helpful to the taxpayer's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.225" offset="291035">In 1976, however, Congress concluded that that broad standard should be rejected because it was too difficult to administer and too prone to abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.564" offset="332413">In its place Congress enacted Section 280A of the Internal Revenue Code to establish a detailed set of restrictive criteria for home office deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.289" offset="375254">As relevant to this case, the statute now permits a deduction only if the home office is used exclusively as the taxpayer's principal place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.910" offset="413811">The taxpayer in this case is a doctor who spends approximately 70 percent of his time administering medical services to patients at hospitals, principally at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.535" offset="464279">He also spends approximately 30 percent of his time doing paperwork related to his practice in an office at his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.141" offset="494686">The tax court and court of appeals held that the doctor's home office constitutes his principal place of business under the statute because the office is essential to the doctor's business, he spends a substantial amount of time there, and he maintains no other office.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.685" offset="560932">The statute, however, does not permit a deduction merely because essential and substantial work-related tasks are performed at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.589" offset="592488">Instead it plainly requires that the home office be the taxpayer's principal place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.843" offset="617566">As this Court has consistently held, the words of revenue statutes should, where possible, be given their ordinary meaning, and in Malat v. Riddell this Court held that in ordinary usage the word principal is synonymous with primary or of first importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.205" offset="686947">Under the plain language of Section 280A, therefore, the courts must make a comparison of each of the various locations in which the taxpayer conducts his business to determine which one of them is primary or of first importance.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="152.214" offset="742954">Mr. Jones, what is the standard of review?</text>
            <text syncTime="156.183" offset="758836">Is it de novo as a mixed question of law and fact here, do you suppose?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="161.320" stopTime="174.414">
            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="161.320" offset="779420">There is a legal standard that must be met, which is what I just described, that the home be the most important place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.724" offset="805020">The factual findings of the tax court or the district court are reviewed on a clearly erroneous basis.</text>

          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="174.414" stopTime="181.801">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="174.414" offset="831770">Do you think there can be only one principal place of business under the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="180.234" offset="855071">I mean, is that the notion?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="181.801" stopTime="194.993">
            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="181.801" offset="861340">Yes, that is the logical result of the language, and in fact as this Court held in Malat v. Riddell, principal means most important.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.791" offset="905331">You can't have two places that are most important.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="194.993" offset="914108">Under the Fourth Circuit view and test that we're reviewing do you think it leaves it open to find more than one principal place of business?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="207.218" stopTime="254.830">
            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="207.218" offset="963009">Certainly, as the Court also held in Malat v. Riddell, the word substantial cannot be equated with principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.824" offset="1001461">That case involved a provision of the Internal Revenue Code which required a finding as to what was the taxpayer's primary purpose in holding certain property, and the Court held in Malat that a finding that the taxpayer had a substantial purpose of holding the property did not satisfy the requirement of what was his principal purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.320" offset="1087456">Substantial is a word of quantity.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.986" offset="1098114">Principal is a word of comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.438" offset="1107936">You can have many substantial activities, but you can only have one principal one.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.176" offset="1126849">You can have many substantial locations of business, but you can only have one principal one.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="254.830" offset="1153494">Doesn't the Commissioner... the Commissioner says that he has to determine where the principal place of business is, but you just said that you have to compare what goes on in the various places and how important they are and things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.874" offset="1217651">So you apparently then in applying the statute apply the same test that the tax court does.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="281.013" offset="1258193">The tax courts had two tests, and we don't recommend either one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.115" offset="1274598">In this case the test that the tax court applied was they developed as a rule that if the office is essential to the taxpayer's business--</text>

            <text syncTime="1551.502" offset="6340158">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.602" offset="6348518">We are here today to resolve the controversy which has arisen between the tax court and the Commissioner over the proper interpretation of the phrase principal place of business for purposes of claiming home office deductions under Internal Revenue Code Section 280A.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.880" offset="6413615">This case arose from the Commissioner's use of the focal point test to deny a home office deduction to Dr. Nader Soliman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.069" offset="6446425">Under the focal point test a taxpayer's principal place of business is the location where goods and services are provided to his customers and revenues are generated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.358" offset="6487594">However, when a taxpayer's business is based in his home but his services are provided elsewhere the focal point test automatically prevents the deduction of what would otherwise be completely legitimate expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.268" offset="6543182">This illogical result is in no way supported by the legislative history of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.272" offset="6567215">Congress enacted Section 280A to prevent taxpayers from deducting expenses for home offices maintained solely for their personal convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.278" offset="6607234">In denying a deduction to a taxpayer whose business requires the use of a home office, the focal point test goes far beyond the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.050" offset="6650389">The tax court recognized the injustice of the focal point test and devised a reasonable and logical interpretation of the entire phrase principal place of business.</text>

            <text syncTime="2458.702" offset="9968985">The tax court, however, rejected this comparison of functions in favor of a more appropriate test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.772" offset="9997197">Rather than require a finding that a home office is more important than another business location the Soliman test requires that the office be essential to the taxpayer's business.</text>

            <text syncTime="2481.515" offset="10060204">This requirement of the Soliman test makes a comparison of functions meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.536" offset="10080266">Once it has been determined that a home office is essential to the taxpayer's business it simply cannot be less important than another business location.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.308" offset="10123420">In his efforts to reverse this case the Commissioner has repeatedly overstated the impact of the Soliman test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.812" offset="10149438">He contends that the Soliman test will vastly expand the class of taxpayers entitled to claim home office deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.984" offset="10178069">There is simply no merit to that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.019" offset="10190189">This class will be expanded to include only a select group of taxpayers who are being unjustly denied home office deductions under the focal point test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.292" offset="10231358">These taxpayers must be engaged in businesses which require essential organizational and management functions which are distinct from the services provided to their customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.950" offset="10273990">They must spend a substantial amount of time on these administrative functions and they must have no other location available to perform these functions of their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.473" offset="10312025">The impact of the Soliman test will be substantially less than professed by the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.912" offset="10353820">The Commissioner also contends that teachers who grade papers at home will be entitled to claim a home office deduction merely because they lack after hours access to their school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.886" offset="10397706">On the contrary, both the Soliman test and the specific language of Section 280A will deny home office deductions to these teachers for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.075" offset="10438457">First, they are provided with fully adequate offices on the job site.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.729" offset="10457056">Second, they take work home with them merely because it is more convenient to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.098" offset="10474506">Maintaining a home office is not essential to their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.918" offset="10489866">And third, as employees of their school systems teachers will be entitled to claim a home office deduction only if the office is required as a condition of their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.358" offset="10531558">Few if any school systems have such a requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.678" offset="10552874">The Soliman test is a realistic recognition of the way a modern business is conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.165" offset="10574816">It recognizes that businessmen such as Dr. Soliman often need to perform essential administrative functions for the continued maintenance and growth of their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.454" offset="10615985">If no location is provided to perform these administrative functions they are entirely justified in establishing an office in their home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.477" offset="10652034">There is simply no basis to conclude that Congress would have objected to the deduction of a home office expense by a taxpayer such as Dr. Soliman.</text>

            <text syncTime="2638.233" offset="10687038">Mr. Sokolow, one of the provisions of 280A(c)(1) is that it doesn't have to be the principal place of business but it is sufficient if it is a place of business when what occurs there is that the office is used by patients, clients, or customers in meeting or dealing with the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.483" offset="10792051">Doesn't that suggest that, although perhaps you can't have a rigid point of sale or point of performance of services test, nonetheless the point of sale or the point of performing the services is of enormous importance to Congress, if you're talking about congressional intent?</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.397" offset="10875747">What this statute says is even if it's not your principal place of business, if it's a place of business where you're selling the goods or performing the services we'll allow a deduction for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.521" offset="10920260">So doesn't that suggest that what counsel for the Government was saying has some truth in it, that it isn't just adding up time, that what's very significant in following congressional intent is where the services are provided or where the goods are sold?</text>

            <text syncTime="2724.255" offset="11031123">I think the exception for a place of business for meeting of clients recognized that doctors and professional people of that nature who maintain those offices often had an office in their home just to meet with clients and a separate office where they did their administrative work, and that was not causing a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.918" offset="11105834">I think it's important to focus on what was causing the problem, and it was not independent contractors such as Dr. Soliman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.072" offset="11134464">It was not psychiatrists who treated patients in their home and had a separate office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.659" offset="11156825">It was employees who were taking these deductions merely for their personal convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.163" offset="11190784">We urge the Court to affirm this decision, not just to uphold the validity of the deduction taken by Dr. Soliman but more importantly to allow small businessmen living in jurisdictions other than the Fourth Circuit the home office deductions which are being denied to them by the Commissioner in his use of the focal point test.</text>
