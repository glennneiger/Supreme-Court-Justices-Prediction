            <text syncTime="19.045" offset="198502">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="21.663" offset="208951">This case concerns the relative priority of a Federal tax lien and a private state law lien as to a specific piece of real property that was acquired by the debtor after the date the Federal tax lien was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.654" offset="256912">It is after-acquired property in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.673" offset="268928">The relevant facts can be summarized simply.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.475" offset="280213">The Federal tax liens at issue in this case arose on December 29, 1986 at the time the taxes against the debtor were assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.731" offset="317202">On July 6, 1987 respondent Zions docketed its judgment against the debtors.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.718" offset="341131">That judgment under state law constituted a lien against the debtors' real property, then owned and after-acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.639" offset="368820">On September 9, 1987, about 2 and a half months later, the IRS filed a notice of Federal tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.144" offset="398809">And finally about 2 weeks after that on September 23, 1987 the debtors acquired the subject property known as the South Street property, the right to which are at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.218" offset="443113">The order therefore was the Federal tax lien arose, then the state judgment was docketed, then the Federal tax lien was filed, and then the debtors acquired the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.074" offset="486580">And the question is whether the IRS's lien has priority as to that piece of after-acquired property.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.062" offset="510509">The general rule as to the priority of a Federal tax lien is that a Federal tax lien has priority over all competing interests unless at the time the Federal tax lien arose the competing interest was specific and perfected.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.506" offset="572262">The rationale, I think, of that rule is that the Federal tax lien can only take so much of the property as is the debtors' and if at the time the Federal tax lien arises some other lien has come and essentially grabbed a part of that property, the Federal tax lien can only take the balance of the interest that was the debtors'.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.598" offset="636628">Now, there are exceptions to that rule and one of the exceptions is section 6323(a), and that provides that a Federal tax lien is not valid against a judgment lien until the Federal tax lien is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.091" offset="686678">Now respondent claims that in this case, this case arises, he is entitled to the benefit of 6323(a), and the effect of that provision therefore is just to move the date from the date of assessment, from the date the tax lien arises on which you determine priorities, to move the date until the date the tax lien was filed, which in this case was September 9, 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.939" offset="774032">I think there are thus two issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.558" offset="784481">The primary question and the one that the court of appeals got wrong was whether the debtors' interest was specific and perfected as of September 9, 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.580" offset="824605">In our view, I mean, in our view the lienholder's interest was not specific and perfected as of that date, and accordingly the tax lien would have priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.620" offset="864729">There is a second question which the court of appeals didn't rely on, but I think maybe the district court did, and that is whether the fact that the Federal tax lien attached to the property at the same time as the state tax, as the judgment lien, whether that alters the result that would follow from a finding that the state lien wasn't specific and perfected as of the date of filing of the Federal tax lien.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.301" offset="955531">May I ask, Mr. Feldman, now, if we weren't dealing with after-acquired property but had a judgment lien on all property of the debtor, would you think a subsequently filed Federal lien would take priority?</text>

            <text syncTime="236.320" offset="1067544">And the issue in that case was whether a lien is sufficiently specific, that is if it just identifies all of the debtor's property rather than giving a specific legal description of the property.</text>

            <text syncTime="250.678" offset="1125013">And this Court held that that was sufficiently specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.664" offset="1132954">And I think the task that is derived from Vermont is whether, on the date of filing of the Federal tax lien whether, if you can determine on that date that a particular piece of property was subject to the judgment lien, then it was specific and perfected on that date.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.520" offset="1276314">The problem is that under the settled task for whether a judgment lien is specific and perfected is whether the identity of the lien or the amount of the lien and the property subject to the lien were established.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.478" offset="1320200">In this case the property subject to the lien was not established as of the date on which you measure the priorities, which is September 9, 1987.</text>

            <text syncTime="413.667" offset="1776925">There would be some interest in property, certainly the interest of a purchased money lender or the interest of an inventory financier or an accounts receivable financier, just the parties who are protected by the Tax Lien Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.057" offset="1826453">Those interests under the UCC as a general matter, although it's quite complex, would have priority over a judgment lien creditor as to the after-acquired property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1139.985" offset="4682264">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.103" offset="4694698">In 1827 Justice John Marshall enunciated what was, he deemed, a cardinal rule, which was a prior lien gives a prior claim entitled to prior satisfaction from the subjected binds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.994" offset="4750287">This has become known as the doctrine of first in time as first in right, and it has become the general Federal common law in the area of competing lien claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.285" offset="4791456">This has also been adopted and codified by use of the, for the Government in establishing the competing liens between a Federal tax lien and certain competing liens as provided in section 6323.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.430" offset="4863971">Because of a contractual stipulation which preceded the litigation in this matter and the acquiescence by the IRS in the Tenth Circuit opinion in all but one issue, the facts of this case are very simple and make a singular issue presented to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.041" offset="4934398">That is will this Court apply the first in time rule in favor of a prior perfected judgment lien over a subsequently filed Federal tax lien when property purchased by the, as against property purchased by the debtor subsequent to all the liens, the after-acquired issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.889" offset="5013810">The facts are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.405" offset="5019870">It is important to note that Zions Bank did everything that was required of it to perfect under state law a general lien on all real property owned by the debtor located in the County of Salt Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.916" offset="5081937">Section 6232 does not explicitly resolve the issue of after-acquired property, but it provides the framework which, very compatibly with prior decisions of this Court and with the intentions of Congress as shown since the institution of the Federal tax lien in 1866, allows a consistent pattern of recognizing the integrity of a judicial judgment lien obtained by a private party.</text>

            <text syncTime="1421.151" offset="5806887">This Court held that the fact that the state lien was general in nature, covering all of the property, it identified no property in particular, was sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="1493.164" offset="6094966">I think just the common law understanding is that the lien doesn't attach until the property is identified, and that's why the provision of the Uniform Commercial Code containing an after-acquired property clause was a real innovation, because it was generally understood in the common law that you can't attach until you know what the property is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1800.411" offset="7323870">I think the reason for, the choateness doctrine requires that the lien be, that the lienor be identified, the amount be ascertained, and the property be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.439" offset="7400043">I believe the reason for that is so that anyone else can rely upon what that lien is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.009" offset="7426270">I think the service is entitled to reliance also upon the actions of other entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.930" offset="7453960">I think that Congress, not only in 1966 but beginning in 1913 and again in 1939, began not to cut back on private competitors with Federal tax liens, rather to allow those liens to compete fairly as on an equal footing with the Federal tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.824" offset="7617591">I think the, it's important to understand the time of perfection in either lien or both liens is important in any case, whether it's before or after the acquisition of property to which that lien will apply, to encourage the diligence of filing, the diligence of enforcement of claims and liens upon property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.689" offset="7717065">If that does not happen the secret lien doctrine, which was the beginning doctrine which was used in 1866, then carries over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.211" offset="7751129">Basically what we have here is a secret lien of the United States which comes in and primes a lien which was placed by a private lien claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.519" offset="7792402">I believe that the congressional intent clearly, under 1966 acts and prior to that as reviewed by various Federal courts, states that the purpose of that act was merely to put them on equal footing and encourage both parties to act diligently in obtaining what rights they are going to receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.551" offset="7892504">Only two circuits have looked at simultaneous attaching or perfection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.388" offset="7911834">Those are the Fifth Circuit in the Southern Rock case, and the Tenth Circuit in McDermott.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.526" offset="7932419">Both circuits saw that it was important to encourage the diligence, encourage that parties can rely upon record title acts in the various counties in which the liens are set.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.903" offset="8009846">Zions acted diligently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.474" offset="8028131">It performed all acts required of the bank to perfect its general lien on all of Mr. McDermott's real property located in Salt Lake County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.413" offset="8071913">It is neither logical nor equitable to allow a 2 month later lien come and prime and subordinate the bank's lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.971" offset="8114127">The integrity of the record title acts throughout the county or the country relies on the consistent judicial support of preferring a prior recorded lien to those subsequently recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.349" offset="8179642">The judicial and legislative preference for Justice Marshall's cardinal rule over the IRS's current desire to resurrect the secret lien doctrine must continue to protect all creditors and preserve confidence in the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.600" offset="8292700">If I might digress a bit on the 1966 act, as the, as counsel mentioned, that several amendments to that act showed that Congress tried to cut back on private rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.609" offset="8352677">Basically those concerned issues which are not relevant to this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.330" offset="8371589">The UCC issue, the purchased money security interest, neither of those are relevant to this case nor the issues at this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.103" offset="8406698">Basically the Congress gave the judgment lien creditor a priority to act on an equal footing requiring recording, perfection in a traditional manner of perfection of real estate liens, equally, without regard to the supreme rights of the sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.431" offset="8496037">This Court can accomplish the reaffirmation of the principle of first in time by reaffirming, by affirming the decision of the Tenth Circuit and allowing the general lien to have attached effectively to the after-acquired property.</text>

            <text syncTime="2143.215" offset="8695090">At page 14 of your brief you address the hypothesis that the liens were, became, were perfected simultaneously, and you say in effect that the statute says that if the private lien were not, did not attach first then the Government, the Government wins a tie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.945" offset="8770009">And you seem to be quoting the statute, but I don't think the statute says that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.980" offset="8782234">And I wonder could you comment a little bit on what, why you would say if there were a tie you wouldn't somehow or other share the proceeds or something, but rather would give the Government priority?</text>

            <text syncTime="2175.336" offset="8823612">--Yeah, I mean, there's two, I think there's two distinct questions there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.455" offset="8836047">One is where there really is a tie would be a case, I would regard a case as for instance the Fifth Circuit case, the Southern Rock case, where there really was simultaneously with the Federal filing there was a state filing, and that would be a real tie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.548" offset="8888500">I think the underlying rationale, even in a case like that the Government should win, because I think the underlying rationale is that unless the prior, is that the Federal tax lien is a very potent form of lien and unless at the time the Federal tax lien either arises or is filed, if at that moment the other lien hasn't already taken the property the Federal tax lien is what attaches to the debtor's property and has a superior interest then.</text>
