            <text syncTime="12.308" offset="179174">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.651" offset="192548">This case comes before the Court on a writ of certiorari from the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.334" offset="215223">The issue for decision is whether 18 U.S. Code section 3243 prohibits the State of Kansas from exercising criminal jurisdiction over an offense defined by the laws of the United States and enumerated in the Major Crimes Act, 18 U.S. Code 1153.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.559" offset="296098">Section 3243 was passed by Congress in 1940, and it conferred jurisdiction on Kansas over intra-Indian offenses to the same extent as its courts had jurisdiction over offenses committed elsewhere within the State in accordance with the laws of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.392" offset="383451">However, Congress added a proviso which states that the courts of the United States shall not be deprived of jurisdiction over offenses defined by the laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.751" offset="432875">The first court to interpret section 3243 was the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Youngbear v. Brewer.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.747" offset="476865">This 1977 decision upheld a lower court's finding that Iowa's jurisdictional statute, which is virtually identical to the Kansas act, did not grant Iowa concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal courts over offenses defined by the laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.120" offset="558367">In 1982, the Kansas Supreme Court, following the reasoning and analysis of the Eighth Circuit in Youngbear, held that the Federal courts had exclusive jurisdiction over Federal offenses defined in the Major Crimes Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.653" offset="624509">Then in 1986, in the case of State of Kansas v. Negonsott, the Kansas Supreme Court reversed itself, holding that the State had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal courts over major crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.002" offset="681874">It is that decision of the Kansas Supreme Court which ultimately gave rise to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.544" offset="704130">The facts of the case are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.799" offset="721058">Briefly, Mr. Negonsott was arrested, tried, and convicted by State authorities in State court for the crime of aggravated battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.173" offset="758570">Now, this crime occurred within the confines of the Kickapoo reservation, and both Mr. Negonsott and the victim were enrolled members of the Kickapoo Nation in Kansas.</text>

            <text syncTime="199.411" offset="927530">The Tenth Circuit upheld the district court's dismissal of the writ of habeas corpus, finding that 18 U.S. Code 3243 granted Kansas concurrent jurisdiction over Federal crimes which are also defined by State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.323" offset="991164">It is our contention that this decision of the Tenth Circuit violates generally accepted principles of Federal Indian law, and is also contrary to the legislative history of the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="364.290" offset="1587069">The Tenth Circuit has held that in that situation, where you also... for example, aggravated battery is of course defined by State law, and when it is defined by State law, then the Federal courts and the State courts have concurrent jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="378.370" offset="1643389">Well, I think there's a little confusion that arises from your use in your brief... and maybe there's no other term, but usually when you say concurrent jurisdiction you mean that two courts have jurisdiction over the same cause of action, or over the same criminal offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="402.045" offset="1738057">What's at issue here is concurrent legislative jurisdiction, in a sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.088" offset="1754253">That is, the State courts... the State government can make criminal under State law certain acts on the reservation and try those offenses in State court, and the Federal Government may make criminal similar acts under Federal law and try those in Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.090" offset="1838263">So that the State courts and the Federal courts don't have concurrent jurisdiction, they have exclusive jurisdiction of their separate crimes, but it's only the legislative jurisdiction that's concurrent--</text>

            <text syncTime="441.011" offset="1893956">Since, as this Court stated in Canon v. University of Chicago that Congress acts with knowledge of existing law and, therefore, absent a clear manifestation of contrary intent a newly-enacted statute is presumed to be harmonious with existing law and its judicial construction, any analysis of the Kansas act must be made in conjunction with the Major Crimes Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.750" offset="2020911">Now, the Major Crimes Act was passed by Congress in 1885 to fill the jurisdictional void left by this Court's decision in Ex parte Crow Dog, because prior to the passage of the Major Crimes Act, tribal courts had exclusive jurisdiction over crimes committed within their reservation boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.354" offset="2111295">Now, the Major Crimes Act has been interpreted by this Court since United States v. Kagama as vesting exclusive jurisdiction with the Federal courts for an Indian defendant committing one of its enumerated crimes, because the purpose of the act was to provide a Federal forum for the prosecution of major crimes and to protect Indians from prosecution in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.442" offset="2219650">Now, in United States v. Kagama this Court detailed many reasons why it felt the Federal courts had to have exclusive jurisdiction over these major crimes: 1) that Indian Nations were, and continue to be today, wards of the Nation, dependent on the United States Government for all political rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.887" offset="2305437">Secondly, because of local ill feeling, the people of the States where they are found are often their deadliest enemies, and therefore Federal jurisdiction was necessary for their protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.885" offset="2353397">In other words, the purpose of the act was to protect Indians from the prejudices of their non-Indian neighbors, and to preclude State legislative interference in their affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.943" offset="2401672">Now, despite Kagama and its progeny, the court of appeals found that Congress impliedly modified the exclusivity of the Federal courts under the Major Crimes Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.231" offset="2458828">It is our contention that had Congress wished to modify the Major Crimes Act as it pertained to Kansas, it could have done so by passing the first version of the bill, which is found in '86 Congressional Record, 5596, and which is set forth verbatim in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.054" offset="2538135">Now, this version expressly provided for concurrent jurisdiction, and explicitly modified the Major Crimes Act as it pertained to Kansas.</text>

            <text syncTime="905.870" offset="3753352">Again, if we take as an example when Congress wishes to convey criminal jurisdiction, Congress makes that intent unequivocally clear, as it did with Public Law 280 jurisdiction... in particular, 18 U.S. Code 1162, which granted criminal jurisdiction to six States, and the law specifically modified the Major Crimes Act, the General Crimes Act and the Assimilative Crimes Act as it pertained to those States.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.955" offset="3913743">It... and, of course, P.L. 280 was passed by Congress in 1953, only a few years after they passed the Iowa statute in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.624" offset="3960450">It seems only logical that had Congress wished to convey total criminal jurisdiction to the State of Kansas, they would have specifically set this forth in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.150" offset="4002455">Absent a clear expression of congressional intent, the interpretation of the statute by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals by the Attorney General and the Solicitor General violates the rules of statutory construction, which is applicable to Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.443" offset="4075703">For example, laws must be liberally construed to favor Indians, and ambiguous statutes should be liberally construed in the favor of Indians and not to their prejudice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1928.719" offset="7844754">The overriding issue in this case is over the words, exclusive jurisdiction, as used in section 1153, the Major Crimes Act, and do these words mean that the Federal Government has exclusivity over Indian country, thereby precluding the State from exercising jurisdiction over the major crimes listed, or do these words identify the body of law that is to be applied by the Federal courts when conducting a prosecution over crimes committed in Indian country?</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.551" offset="7976098">The words, exclusive jurisdiction in the Major Crimes Act does not mean that the Federal Government has exclusive jurisdiction to prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.696" offset="8016640">The words do not apply to prosecutorial jurisdiction extended over Indian country, but are only used as a description of the laws which are extended to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.774" offset="8061048">The clause refers to the body of law and procedure, and not to the exclusivity of prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.609" offset="8092395">It does not confer the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal courts, but identifies the law that is applied in those courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.616" offset="8132415">Of course, since jurisdiction over Indian country can only be obtained through an act of Congress, only the Federal Government could exercise jurisdiction pursuant to section 1153, unless through another act of Congress Kansas was given jurisdiction in Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.777" offset="8209006">It is not the language, exclusive jurisdiction, as used in section 1153, that precludes the exercise of State jurisdiction over conduct by Indians in Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.086" offset="8258220">The preclusion flows from the general principles that the State has no inherent jurisdiction over Indians in Indian country, and may exercise jurisdiction only where, as authorized in the Kansas act, there is a clear grant of authority by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.248" offset="8330945">Where does exclusivity come from in the Major Crimes Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.561" offset="8352157">The exclusivity comes from the fact that Congress delegated authority to the United States in that act, and it means exactly what it says.</text>

            <text syncTime="2414.389" offset="9787428">So when you... so the Major Crimes Act was enacted, and its purpose was to solve that problem and to make certain that major crimes were prosecutable by the United States, and even in that case, or the subsequent case of Kagama that construed the Major Crimes Act, this Court made it very clear that that did not express limitations upon the powers of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.780" offset="9916996">Even with the cases that have talked about the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Government, this matter has not spoken to a limitation in regard to the powers of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.904" offset="9993482">Ms. Thompson referred to the fact that the language, shall not deprive, is mandatory, and therefore Kansas doesn't have concurrent jurisdiction, and I think that meets basically the same issue that we just discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.370" offset="10095360">This reserves a right to the Federal Government to proceed accordingly with the laws that it has enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.594" offset="10136320">The Kansas act is unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.409" offset="10159517">The first sentence, standing alone, unambiguously confers on Kansas criminal jurisdiction over all criminal offenses committed by or against Indians on Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.178" offset="10206641">Congress by the passage of the Kansas act granted to Kansas jurisdiction that had only been granted... previously had only been granted to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.404" offset="10247497">Just as unambiguously, the second sentence preserved the subject matter jurisdiction of Federal courts over crimes defined by Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.161" offset="10290547">The Federal courts retained their jurisdiction to entertain any prosecution under the Major Crimes Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.536" offset="10320013">The canon of construction that full effect should be given to all of the statute's language leads to the conclusion that the Federal Government has concurrent jurisdiction with the State's unqualified grant of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.705" offset="10376751">Congress created a body of law that applies to Federal enclaves that are within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States by the enactment of the Federal Enclaves Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.224" offset="10426801">This body of law was extended to Indian country by the Major Crimes Act and the General Crimes Act, but those acts do not make Indian country a Federal enclave, and for that reason, it is the body of law that applies and not the exclusive authority of the courts of the United States that was extended to Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.056" offset="10514155">And so reference to, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, refers to the subject matter jurisdiction of the body of law to be extended to Indian country, and not the type of jurisdiction that was conferred upon the Federal courts, because Congress did not make Indian country a Federal enclave.</text>

            <text syncTime="2636.053" offset="10674129">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.535" offset="10732016">I just have a few points to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.507" offset="10743928">First, on the language of the statute, it's quite clear, in our view, that the statute gave Kansas complete jurisdiction to prosecute offenses to the full extent of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.915" offset="10789590">The second sentence of the statute, it seems to us, merely maintained Federal jurisdiction where it existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.178" offset="10822609">It is not an implied repeal of the Major Crimes Act to give the State jurisdiction over a crime under State law, because after the passage of section 3243 and before, the Federal courts had jurisdiction to entertain major crimes prosecutions under section 1153.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.930" offset="10893662">Now, petitioner has referred to the first version of the bill and its inclusion of the word, concurrent, and the reference to modification of the Major Crimes Act as indicating that Congress must have meant something different in the final version of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.202" offset="10970671">In fact, we think Congress did mean something different, and it's fully explained in the legislative history what Congress meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.496" offset="10995853">Prior to the passage... excuse me, at the time this statute was under consideration, the Federal Government did not have jurisdiction over so-called minor crimes under what is now section 1152 between two Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.849" offset="11061263">The Federal Government does not have that jurisdiction today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.800" offset="11073071">It's quite clear, however, that under the Kansas act the State has jurisdiction over minor crimes between two Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.195" offset="11102641">Moreover, at the time the act was under consideration there was some uncertainty as to the applicability of the Assimilative Crimes Act in Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.370" offset="11139422">That uncertainty, of course, was removed by the Court's decision 6 years later in Williams v. United States, but it's quite clear that Congress meant, by removing the word, concurrent from the final version of the bill, to make clear that Kansas had more jurisdiction than the Federal Government had to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.653" offset="11212565">Thus, the amendment was intended to make the bill broader rather than narrower than the first version.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.256" offset="11242971">Now, another problem in petitioner's position, of course, is that the modification referred to in the first version of the bill referred to what was then... what has now become section 1152, so-called minor crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.577" offset="11304202">Petitioner's position in this Court, however, is that that's all the State was granted jurisdiction over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.481" offset="11327817">If the removal of the modification of the Major Crimes Act reference in the version of the bill was intended to retain exclusive jurisdiction over major crimes prosecutions, the same must be true of jurisdiction over section 1152 prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.479" offset="11383823">The States generally do not have jurisdiction over minor crimes involving Indians unless Congress grants it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.155" offset="11418514">Thus, the petitioner can have it one way but not both, it seems to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.679" offset="11444637">That is, under her view, there should be no concurrent jurisdiction at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2833.624" offset="11464385">You say under her view, then, or under the petitioner's view, the Kansas courts would have gotten no additional jurisdiction under the first sentence.</text>

            <label>Mr. William K. Kelley</label>
            <text syncTime="2846.011" offset="11513913">Well, the Kansas courts would have gotten jurisdiction, Mr. Chief Justice, over minor crimes between two Indians, because Federal jurisdiction did not exist over those crimes then, and it does not today, and there's some question whether Kansas would have had jurisdiction over assimilative crimes that are defined by reference to State law rather than general Federal crimes defined by reference to Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.728" offset="11604819">The proviso in the Kansas act refers to not depriving Federal courts of jurisdiction over offenses defined by Federal law, and if assimilative crimes are viewed as being defined by reference to State law, then an argument can be made that the State would have jurisdiction over those offenses as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.948" offset="11673678">But it's quite clear that Congress meant to grant the State more than concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.341" offset="11695308">That is, more than the Federal courts had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.693" offset="11704712">It's also quite clear, however, that Congress meant to preserve Federal major crimes jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.868" offset="11725401">That jurisdiction was in one sense exclusive at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.379" offset="11743373">That is, only the Federal Government could prosecute crimes arising out of conduct that was made criminal under the offenses enumerated in the Major Crimes Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.015" offset="11786005">After passage of the act, the State has that power as well, to prosecute under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.690" offset="11804708">The Federal jurisdiction to prosecute crimes defined by Federal law, which is what the statute says, was exclusive then, and it remains exclusive today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.628" offset="11844415">With respect to the lack of clarity as to the consent of the tribes at the time, Justice Stevens, in response to your question earlier, it is somewhat unclear from history what the positions of the tribes were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.570" offset="11908153">As General Stephan mentioned, there was some question as to the legitimacy of the Potawatomi Business Committee that sent the letter at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.505" offset="11943889">We would submit, of course, that the Secretary of Interior was the person in a position to determine which group spoke for the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.792" offset="11981087">All we know from the legislative history is that the executive branch understood the four tribes to want the legislation, and Congress, of course, acted on that understanding, so to the extent that we're trying to determine the meaning of what Congress enacted, its understanding of what the tribes wanted at the time, of course, should be what counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.065" offset="12062171">Now that, of course, does not undermine our position that the canon and the statutes should be construed liberally in favor of Indians does not warrant a different result here for at least two reasons: 1) it's unclear that the canon urged by petitioner is in favor of the Indians generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.850" offset="12149316">Of course, it's in favor of him, but the concerns that animated this statute were to protect tribal law and order on the reservations at the time, and we submit that it was in the interests of the Indians for that statute to be passed for that end.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.168" offset="12198530">Moreover, no canon of construction can overcome what we regard as the plain language of the statute, and of course it's quite plain legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.955" offset="12241685">If the Court has any further questions... otherwise, I will submit it.</text>

            <label>Ms. Pamela S. Thompson</label>
            <text syncTime="3037.081" offset="12278256">The first point I'd like to make is regarding the argument of double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.149" offset="12318485">It's not our contention that the State of Kansas, when it's acting under this law, and the Federal Government... the State of Kansas when it's acting under this law is some sort of an arm of the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.567" offset="12368222">Our contention has always been that the United States Government is one sovereign and the State of Kansas is another sovereign, and therefore an Indian person could, conceivably, be left wide open to double prosecution by both the Federal Government and by the State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.437" offset="12443663">Secondly, regarding the legislative history of the act, again I would urge the Court to give full credence to what Congressman Lambertson said in his letter... that the State of Kansas was to get full jurisdiction for small offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.491" offset="12519837">This is an expression of the will of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.203" offset="12538749">If the State of Kansas was to have jurisdiction... concurrent jurisdiction over major crimes, certainly Congressman Lambertson would have put that in his letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.832" offset="12585247">It would have taken another five or six words to say, and the State will have concurrent jurisdiction over major crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.656" offset="12616490">Taking into consideration the fact that, as this Court has held for the past 100-plus years, jurisdiction in the Federal court over the major crimes is exclusive technically under this law, that does not do away with the exclusivity of the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.638" offset="12696424">However, in reality it does, because if the laws--</text>

            <text syncTime="3146.063" offset="12714188">Of course, in your view, it would have been very simple... if I may just interrupt you on the textual point, it would have been very simple in the second sentence simply to add one more word.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.178" offset="12746579">This section shall not deprive the courts of the United States of exclusive jurisdiction over offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.704" offset="12768731">That would have been the textually easier way to get to the point that you want us to reach, and yet Congress didn't follow that.</text>

Congress in 1953 was in the process of passing Public Law 280, they were very specific in granting the States given criminal jurisdiction that the Major Crimes Act and the General Crimes Act and the Assimilative Crimes Act would be modified accordingly.</text>
