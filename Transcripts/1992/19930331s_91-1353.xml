            <text syncTime="10.070" offset="121999">This case comes to us from the Supreme Court of Maine, it involves the question of construing the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act, and the question is whether a service man who fail to pay his taxes and has his property sold foreclosure was entitled to benefit of the Act which would enable him to postponed the period of redemption throughout his period of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.075" offset="226070">The Maine Supreme Court in a divided opinion held that he was not entitled to the benefit of the statute because he could not prove that the service had caused him any prejudice with regard to his ability to pay his taxes, and felt that a literal reading on the statute which provide for the tolling of the redemption period was absurd and illogical.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.682" offset="344457">We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict and we reverse the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine and hold that the statute basically means what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.409" offset="403390">We reject the argument that the petitioner advances largely on the basis of legislative history and fairness and apply a literal construction of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.176" offset="446439">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
