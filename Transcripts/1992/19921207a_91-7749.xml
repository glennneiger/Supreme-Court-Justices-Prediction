            <text syncTime="182.381" offset="870914">The problem that petitioner has with that approach to the problem, though, is that Congress has conferred the jurisdiction... not the courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="210.899" offset="985017">But we have to rethink it again this time.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.283" offset="1018558">Congress can limit it... as this Court, faced with a Texas legislative decision in Estelle v. Dorrough, where the Texas legislature limited the legislatively granted right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.862" offset="1068818">We do believe that the discretionary analysis in this case was abused for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.557" offset="1095672">And these three reasons are ones that historically courts have looked at in order to determine whether or not, in its discretion, and in the exercises of its supervisory powers, a court ought to decline to hear an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.636" offset="1159933">Those three grounds are: no prejudice... prejudice in the appellate court; prejudiced into potential post-appellate proceedings; and the vindication of the court's authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.786" offset="1212596">In this case, under the analysis of all three of those factors, it would have been an abuse of discretion not to have gone forward with the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.991" offset="1245406">So on factor number one... prejudice to the appellate court... there was none.</text>

            <text syncTime="355.623" offset="1563891">The Court has ruled on cases where fugitives have been fugitives at the time appeal was pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.129" offset="1597954">However, in those cases, the Court was reversing a favorable result at the court of appeals level.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.065" offset="1629719">Nevertheless, the Court did not take the position that automatically, because the fugitive had left during the appeal pending, that the court was divested of jurisdiction in some fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.262" offset="1678516">Rather, the Court looked at the individual case, and made a determination whether or not in this Court's powers, it ought to decline to hear the appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="404.396" offset="1758973">Because our only authority over State courts is the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.948" offset="1777259">Whereas, here you're relying... at least in part... on the congressional grant of the right of appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="430.193" offset="1862209">Rather, it... it made reference to the fact that it had the authority not to hear the appeal, but did not say that it was divested somehow of jurisdiction because the appeal... because the petitioner was a fugitive.</text>

            <text syncTime="484.489" offset="2079339">However, it is still in the court's... it is still a discretionary, rather than a mandatory, reflexive application of a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.794" offset="2112567">Because in this particular case, I would suggest to the Court, that because the issue is strictly and solely sufficiency of the evidence, and because the record has already been prepared and the briefs are already filed, that even a period of fugitivity for 3 years might not necessarily result in an automatic dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.597" offset="2203786">At that point, Your Honor, I believe that the third issue that courts look at... vindication of the court's authority... would largely come into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.803" offset="2236596">And this Court has consistently... or at least consistently when the petitioner was the... the criminal defendant... has consistently denied that kind of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.821" offset="2276720">In this case, the appeal... the record has been prepared, the brief has been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.097" offset="2313814">The only issue in the case is sufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.929" offset="2329174">And, moreover, the merits of the appeal are not just abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.632" offset="2355923">Rather, a similarly situated codefendant has had his conviction reversed because of the insufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.091" offset="2397824">The defendant in this case received a 15-year sentence on the same case for which the court of appeals for the similarly situated codefendant reversed the conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3219.010" offset="13017435">We can at least accomplish that much, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.292" offset="13030601">Now, as I stated, a supervisory... a rule formulated by a court of appeals in its supervisory capacity is valid, as long as that rule does not conflict with the Constitution, a statute, or rules of procedure, is one that can properly be established through adjudication, and is reasonable in light of the concerns it is designed to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.612" offset="13147838">And I would just... as a respect to the authority to establish these rules through adjudication, I would just like to point out that that authority is expressly conferred by the Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 47, which says that in all cases not provided for by formal rules promulgated by a vote of the circuit justices, the court of appeals may regulate their practice in any manner not inconsistent with the Federal Rules of Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.520" offset="13271450">And this brings up another point that petitioner made in his argument, which I would like to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.205" offset="13298199">He makes the argument that if a rule is mandatory... if a rule adopted by the court of appeals in the exercise of its supervisory power is a general rule, a blanket rule to which it decides to make no exceptions, that means that the court is somehow abridging its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.049" offset="13381582">And we would submit that that is absolute nonsense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.732" offset="13396315">Because the consequence of that argument would be that every time a court... through formulating local rules, or this Court through formulating Rules of Appellate Procedure... makes a general rule, it's somehow amending Section 1291, which is clearly untrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.244" offset="13470398">A court may choose to exercise its dismissal authority in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.209" offset="13494222">But in a further case, it could always change its mind because it still retains jurisdiction over those particular types of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.563" offset="13531629">And, of course, in Molinaro v. New Jersey, this Court recognized that for fugitive dismissal rules, the fact that an individual is fugitive, does not strip the case of its character as an adjudicable case or controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.805" offset="13588681">So the issue of lacking jurisdiction is just... it's a straw man in this case.</text>
