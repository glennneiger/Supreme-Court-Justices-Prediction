            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="142058">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 92-515, Wisconsin v. Todd Mitchell.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.388" offset="179570">General Doyle.</text>

          <turn speaker="james_e_doyle" startTime="10.575" stopTime="95.416">
            <label>Mr. James E. Doyle</label>
            <text syncTime="10.575" offset="184272">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.260" offset="203080">The Wisconsin penalty enhancement statute quite simply does not punish thought and it does not punish the expression of any idea or belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.631" offset="236517">It punishes criminal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.490" offset="243936">Mr. Mitchell was and is free to think any thought he wants to think.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.144" offset="262535">He was and is free to express that thought in any legitimate manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.642" offset="280611">But when he violates the Wisconsin criminal code he subjects himself to the punishment of the State of Wisconsin, and it is perfectly appropriate for the State of Wisconsin through its legislature and courts to consider his reason for committing the crime in determining what the appropriate sentence should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.465" offset="347903">On the face of this statute there is no reason to suggest that Wisconsin is involved in some sinister motive to control thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.461" offset="387818">The statute is in our brief at page 3, and we believe that it quite clearly serves two very legitimate state interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.300" offset="419165">It punishes criminal conduct and assesses the appropriate penalty range for a particular type of crime, and it addresses the harmful effects of discriminatory conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.702" offset="464827">Nobody suggests that Wisconsin's interest in dealing with the harmful effects of discriminatory criminal conduct are not substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.339" offset="499413">45 other states in this country have adopted laws of some sort attempting to deal with this problem.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="95.416" stopTime="118.094">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="95.416" offset="523655">General Doyle, your state supreme court was of the opposite view.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.054" offset="542254">I mean your state supreme court said that in fact this, or in law, I don't know which, this statute does control thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.127" offset="582482">Now, are we bound by... it's after all their statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.033" offset="594185">It's not ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.814" offset="597216">Are we bound by their determination as to what it is directed at?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_e_doyle" startTime="118.094" stopTime="151.439">
            <label>Mr. James E. Doyle</label>
            <text syncTime="118.094" offset="614352">It is our view that the Supreme Court of Wisconsin decided in law that the Wisconsin statute punished thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.106" offset="646430">They did not go through any kind of statutory construction, there was no issue about the meaning of a particular word, there was no discussion of legislative history, there was no ambiguity in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.492" offset="695958">They came to a conclusion in which they declared that the statute punishes thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.036" offset="714140">That is a, in my judgment a conclusory constitutional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.129" offset="734515">In fact that's the same as saying it violates the First Amendment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="151.439" stopTime="166.386">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="151.439" offset="747785">But if some other state supreme court came to the same disposition that your state supreme court but used legislative history and decided as a factual matter that it had been intended to punish thought, then we would have to come out differently in your view?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_e_doyle" startTime="166.386" stopTime="197.264">
            <label>Mr. James E. Doyle</label>
            <text syncTime="166.386" offset="807554">It very much depends on what the analysis was.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.853" offset="825421">If it turns on the meaning of a phrase, if it turns on the meaning of what particular language means, I think you would have to respect the decisions of the state supreme court with respect to what the language is on the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.974" offset="869934">But when you are dealing with what the practical effect in First Amendment terms is of a particular kind of statute, and balanced against First Amendment standards, then I think that you may, that that's a First Amendment question that this Court may consider.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="197.264" stopTime="203.653">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="197.264" offset="931060">You, in other words you're saying that their comments were directed to the First Amendment consequences of this statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_e_doyle" startTime="203.653" stopTime="226.769">
            <label>Mr. James E. Doyle</label>
            <text syncTime="203.653" offset="956660">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.136" offset="962512">And in fact in reading that opinion it's quite clear that they not only looked at the Wisconsin statute, they in fact declared what hate crime, as they declared it, hate crime statutes in general what the First Amendment consequences were.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.241" offset="1014966">They looked at the model ADL statute for example and declared what these kinds of, what these kinds of laws mean in First Amendment terms.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="226.769" stopTime="253.804">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="226.769" offset="1049134">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.066" offset="1050283">That's on page A8 and A9 of the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.768" offset="1061046">The discussion of the model statute is right after the comment that Justice Scalia has in mind, I think, because the state court does say without doubt the hate crime statute punishes bigoted thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.777" offset="1109111">And the state asserts the statute punishes only conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.761" offset="1121023">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.761" offset="1125098">That does sound like a state law conclusion that's binding on us.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.696" offset="1144742">It's certainly questionable.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_e_doyle" startTime="253.804" stopTime="284.228">
            <label>Mr. James E. Doyle</label>
            <text syncTime="253.804" offset="1157176">Your Honor, I believe that that is their conclusion, that they then lead into their reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.303" offset="1175253">They then go to the ADL statute and then at page 37 of the Appendix, the Joint Appendix and their opinion, they say that the Wisconsin statute, based on the history of these anti-biased statutes, plural, looking at anti-biased statutes in general punish bigoted bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.216" offset="1246829">So I believe that the Wisconsin Supreme Court was taking a very broad look at what it, at a genre of laws that it labeled hate crimes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="284.228" stopTime="291.992">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="284.228" offset="1278907">Well, ordinarily we decide what a statute is directed at by the terms of the statute itself, I take it, don't we?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_e_doyle" startTime="291.992" stopTime="323.884">
            <label>Mr. James E. Doyle</label>
            <text syncTime="291.992" offset="1309940">Well, that's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.772" offset="1317046">I believe what the Wisconsin Supreme Court has not put into its opinion and that I would ask this Court to look at directly are the terms of the Wisconsin statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.786" offset="1349124">The terms of the Wisconsin statute, for example with respect to what is punished, states very clearly that the penalties for the underlying crime will be enhanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.173" offset="1382665">It is the punishment for the underlying crime that is being enhanced by this.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.670" offset="1400638">So on the face of the Wisconsin statute we have a statute that is punishing the criminal conduct of Todd Mitchell, not some abstract thought that he may have engaged in.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="323.884" stopTime="345.486">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="323.884" offset="1437522">I take it you make no distinction between, or do you, a statute which simply enhances a sentence for this kind of conduct and a hypothetical statute say in another state which makes this a substantive crime of, in a free-standing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.893" offset="1513591">I take it there would be no difference, or would there?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_e_doyle" startTime="345.486" stopTime="425.890">
            <label>Mr. James E. Doyle</label>
            <text syncTime="345.486" offset="1523936">I believe there is no constitutional difference, although let me add I think the Wisconsin case is even cleaner than the second one that you gave, that because in order to get into the enhanced punishment... we have not tried to create any type of new crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.011" offset="1574091">You have to violate the generally applicable laws of the State of Wisconsin in order to even be eligible for the penalty enhancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.493" offset="1603975">So we don't run into some of the problems that some other attempts at this, some other states may have attempted of trying to define some new kind of offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.208" offset="1642845">We have dealt with this strictly as a sentencing matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.848" offset="1653398">Let me say that I believe that the state's interest in dealing with these problems is evidenced by the facts of this case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.766" offset="1697075">Todd Mitchell participated in the brutal beating of a 14-year old boy walking down the street of his home town in Kenosha, and the facts of this case are very clear that that young 14-year old boy would never have been beaten except for his race.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.681" offset="1760709">This case, Wisconsin's statute was in place, fortunately, which quite directly dealt with that kind of criminal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.442" offset="1795818">It assessed the, the Wisconsin legislature assessed the kind of, had determined the appropriate sentencing range and the judge assessed the proper sentence for the criminal conduct that was involved in this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="425.890" stopTime="435.074">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="425.890" offset="1845555">I would guess in most cases you're not going to get nearly as clear of an evidentiary finding as you did in this as to the motive for the crime?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_e_doyle" startTime="435.074" stopTime="482.557">
            <label>Mr. James E. Doyle</label>
            <text syncTime="435.074" offset="1882336">It is likely you would not find one so clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.104" offset="1902398">This is obviously a very clear case.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.368" offset="1907518">But let me say Wisconsin is, again has afforded the defendant an added protection that I don't think even Dawson would require, for example, which is the factual basis that he intentionally selected the victim because of the victim's race must be there and it must be proven by the prosecutor beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.751" offset="1989020">So the defendant in this case, this is not simply a judge saying that I have heard the evidence and I believe based on the evidence that there was a motive that I am going to impose a higher sentence than I would normally impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.435" offset="2035727">This is a finding by a jury, proven by the prosecutor beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim was selected because of the victim's race.</text>

            <text syncTime="482.557" offset="2072194">Is that submitted to the jury at the same time that the substantive criminal offense is tried?</text>

          <turn speaker="james_e_doyle" startTime="487.084" stopTime="556.963">
            <label>Mr. James E. Doyle</label>
            <text syncTime="487.084" offset="2090375">Yes, it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.022" offset="2094136">The jury is given a special verdict under the Wisconsin penalty enhancement statute and it is, they return two verdicts, guilt or innocence on the charge and as well as the question on whether or not the defendant intentionally selected the victim because of the victim's race, or whatever the particular status may be in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.905" offset="2169578">And it is that point, I believe, that is extremely important in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.700" offset="2192775">What the Wisconsin statute does is look at the intentional selection of the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.150" offset="2214613">There is a lot of talk about biased thought, hate thought, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.977" offset="2229869">The Wisconsin statute does not go after biased thought or hate thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.023" offset="2246065">We don't know whether Mr. Mitchell had racial bias or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.927" offset="2261738">It's likely he did given the facts of the case, but we don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.691" offset="2272814">And to a large measure in Wisconsin we don't care.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.175" offset="2282740">For example, Mr. Mitchell might have selected that victim because of his race simply to show off to the group of young men that was around him about how tough he was or some other reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.905" offset="2325581">We don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.327" offset="2327358">Mr. Mitchell may have the benignest thoughts about race relations as are possible, and yet he would be guilty under the Wisconsin law because he intentionally selected the victim because of the victim's race.</text>

            <text syncTime="1455.491" offset="5964020">Those things would raise greater questions just on the face of the statute about whether the state had in mind the regulation of thought or speech as opposed to the goals that we say are furthered by this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.485" offset="6011981">The theory of the Wisconsin Supreme Court that simply because the underlying crime is already punished the enhancement must be directed at thought is a theory that if accepted is broad enough to invalidate this nation's anti-discrimination laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.152" offset="6070600">All of the Federal laws that deal with anti-discrimination look to the motive of the actor in assessing whether the conduct is in fact the sort of discrimination that's meant to be prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.210" offset="6118874">This Court noted that as recently as yesterday's opinion in the Hazen Paper Company case, that it is the motive of the actor that is the focus of the law and without an impermissible motive the conduct in question is not regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.704" offset="6168820">But the Court has also recognized in upholding the constitutionality of those laws that simply because motive is an element does not mean that it is Government's goal to target thought for its own sake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.919" offset="6213647">What Government has done in these laws is attempt to reach the evils that occur as a result of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.087" offset="6242381">And in the context of race-motivated crime I think those evils are very apparent, very worthwhile for Government to take efforts to suppress, and there is no indication whatsoever that the underlying goal here of the Wisconsin legislature is somehow to punish speech or thought for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.360" offset="6311449">Unlike the law that this Court had before it in R.A.V., Wisconsin is not regulating speech in any form or expressing disapproval of disfavored ideas for its own sake.</text>

            <label>Mr. James E. Doyle</label>

            <text syncTime="3423.108" offset="13834401">With respect to the questions about the Wisconsin Supreme Court and whether they went beyond statements about whether this just simply applies to bias and thought, I direct the Court's attention to footnote 13 in the Appendix and the petition for the writ at page 14, in which the court says while the statute as-written may extend to situations where the actor in fact is not biased, this does not save the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.206" offset="13950802">So the Wisconsin Supreme Court at least to this instance did read the words of the statute and did recognize that the words of the statute extend to somebody who is not in fact biased.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.969" offset="13985911">Further, with respect to several of the questions, Justice Thomas' question at the end, let, I'd like the record to be clear in this case that there was no evidence put in at the trial court by the state other than the facts of the case themselves and the words about go get a white, are you all hyped up to get a white boy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.695" offset="14060830">There was no evidence put in by the state about any underlying bias on the part of Mr. Mitchell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.379" offset="14083505">To this day the state does not know whether Mr. Mitchell harbors biased thoughts or benign racial thoughts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.127" offset="14110463">I suspect they are not good based on the crime itself, but there was no evidence on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.421" offset="14131674">And finally I'd like to mention just briefly the in whole or in part so that there's no confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.874" offset="14149542">That's an amendment to the statute that occurred after this particular case came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.621" offset="14168455">The, Wisconsin generally defines because of as a substantial factor test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.291" offset="14191129">Justice Bablitch in his dissent indicated that it was a substantial factor and a kind of a hybrid substantial factor but-for test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.631" offset="14224566">And in fact the jury instruction that was not objected to that is part of the record said that if, that the reason for the selection of the victim, it said the reason for the selection of the victim had to be on account of the victim's race.</text>
