            <text syncTime="26.281" offset="245650">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="28.833" offset="255785">The issue in this case is whether the double jeopardy clause bars successive prosecutions for contempt of court and substantive criminal offenses which are based on the same underlying conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.093" offset="312837">Our position is that the double jeopardy clause does not bar such successive prosecutions because crimes such as assault with intent to kill or drug trafficking are not the same offense as contempt of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.455" offset="378352">Now, this case comes to the Court on certiorari to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.625" offset="403011">The facts of the case briefly are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.144" offset="417013">Respondents were both proceeded against under contempt of court proceedings for violating court orders that prohibited them from engaging in certain criminal acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.702" offset="463302">Respondent Dixon was barred by an order that was part of a pretrial release condition that provided that he should not commit any crimes, and Respondent Foster was found to have violated a civil protection order which provided that he must not assault, molest, or threaten his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.269" offset="565597">After they were both found in contempt for violating those orders, they were prosecuted criminally for, in Foster's case, assault with intent to kill, and other assaults, and in Dixon's case for the drug trafficking offense that formed the basis for his contempt proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="142.193" offset="709271">In these particular cases, no, the prosecutor would not prove any additional facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="156.452" offset="766322">I think literally it probably does fall within the language of the formulation that the Court adopted in Grady.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.856" offset="795893">Now, I hasten to add... this is a major part of our submission here... that that formulation the Court has already said in Felix was unduly broad and the Court noted in Felix that that formulation should not be followed to the limits of its language.</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="202.581" offset="950851">--And I think they are easily distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.366" offset="961927">Both of those cases involved a New York... a sort of double header New York contempt statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.020" offset="988572">There was... and if I can go into the details of those statutes, it's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.991" offset="1008425">One of them was section 750 of the judiciary law of New York, which was contempt, and provided that a court could hold somebody in contempt for a variety of acts, including refusal to comply with an order to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.100" offset="1068925">There was another provision of New York law, section 600 of the penal law that was in effect in those days, which had almost exactly the same language, also entitled contempt, and provided that courts could penalize people for various things, including failure to testify in response to a direct order of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.014" offset="1152517">To the extent that there's any suggestion... and the Court in this case did not... in... excuse me, in Colombo and Menna did not reach the underlying double jeopardy questions, but to the extent that there's any suggestion that there was merit to the underlying double jeopardy claims, it was simply saying that you can't prosecute somebody for contempt and then come back and say well, we're going to prosecute you for contempt again, when the two contempt proceedings have exactly the same elements. That case did not at all involve the situation that we have here, where we have a contempt proceeding which has elements A and B, and we have criminal acts which are not part of contempt which have elements D, E, and F.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.129" offset="1248961">The elements simply do not overlap in this setting and that, in our view, makes all the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.543" offset="1326701">Now--</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="297.226" offset="1329418">Mr. Bryson, if I understand what you're saying, the premise of what you're saying is this, that criminal contempt does not have as its element, or as an element, the commission of either one of the two crimes which these respective parties committed.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="316.306" offset="1405695">But it seems to me that that's really not the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.808" offset="1415726">Isn't the point not whether the generic offense, if you will, of criminal contempt has elements of other crimes, but whether the court order in this case has as its... whether violation of the court order in this case required proof of a crime, and in fact the court order in this case did forbid a crime and its violation required the proof, so why isn't this like Harris v. United States?</text>

            <text syncTime="361.318" offset="1585731">The offense is contempt of court.</text>

            <text syncTime="364.120" offset="1596912">Yes, but it's equally true that there is no offense of contempt of court unless there is a court order and the offense is confined to the elements of that order, isn't that true?</text>

            <text syncTime="390.834" offset="1703805">There is one essential respect in which the offense of contempt of court is different... criminal contempt of court is different from the normal crime, and that is, it has no specific elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.042" offset="1752602">No one can be charged generically with contempt of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.530" offset="1766603">One can only be charged with contempt for violating a specific order, and therefore it seems to me that any contempt analysis has got to include the specific order that was violated, and if that includes the elements of a crime, i.e. because it forbids the commission of any crime, that is the datum that you look to to decide whether you're talking about a Harris situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="430.145" offset="1861062">Well, I don't think so, Your Honor, and let me give you an analogy that I think applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.799" offset="1887707">Suppose the crime in question is failure to follow a lawful order of a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.453" offset="1910277">That would not incorporate, in effect, all possible human activity that could be subject to a police officer's order as being elements of that crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.324" offset="1953744">The crime is failing to follow an order of a police officer, and if the order of a police officer is don't shoot that man, it doesn't make murder a lesser included offense, in effect, of the offense of failing to follow a lawful order of a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.686" offset="2019260">It's the same situation here.</text>

            <text syncTime="470.903" offset="2024066">Well, it seems to me the trouble is there that the... at least as generally understood, the offense of failing to follow the order of an officer refers to orders for the commission or the prohibition of discretionary acts, not the incorporation by police officers of the criminal law... of specific provisions of the criminal law, so I don't think that analogy gets you anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.651" offset="2119047">Do you agree with me that there is at least an essential difference between the offense of criminal contempt and the offense, let's say, of burglary, in the sense that there are no specific elements of the offense of criminal contempt?</text>
            <text syncTime="511.513" offset="2186548">You cannot charge a criminal contempt without something more, i.e., a court order.</text>

            <text syncTime="538.414" offset="2294172">The Government has to actually prove what the statement was and then show that it was false.</text>

Corbin has always regarded contempt and the substantive offense as being separate offenses, and that's consistent with the common law approach to the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.794" offset="5511622">It's quite clear under common law the contempt was regarded as a separate offense from substantive crimes that were based on the same conduct, and that has been the position of every court of appeals and every State supreme court up until Grady v.

            <text syncTime="1402.099" offset="5748918">It always was understood contempt had the same elements that it does now, and it was a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.172" offset="5773160">There's no question that it's always been... criminal contempt has always been regarded as a crime, so the substantive status of contempt was always the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.242" offset="5805447">It has... additional procedures have attached to contempt such as jury trial, but the substance of the offense has been the same, and therefore presumably the analysis of whether it's the same offense as a substantive crime would have stayed the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.002" offset="5864484">Now, the Court in Grady changed all this, at least as perceived by the lower courts, with the formulation that the Court adopted in Grady, which was the formulation that this Court talked about in Felix, that to establish an essential element of an offense charged in the second prosecution, the State will prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.937" offset="5992275">Now, read broadly, that formula we concede would appear to cover this case, but that is an extremely broad formulation which has proved very difficult to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.095" offset="6040863">We have urged the Court and do continue to urge the Court either to limit that formulation by limiting Grady to its context, or overruling Grady.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.569" offset="6086734">Now, the Court has already done the first in Felix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.390" offset="6101989">What the Court has said is that the formulation in Grady cannot be applied broadly, cannot be applied outside of the context of Grady, that... the Court said that taken out of context and read literally the language from the formulation supports the defense of double jeopardy, but we decline to read the language so expansively because of the context in which Grady arose and because of difficulties that have already arisen in its interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.024" offset="6208569">The context of Grady was a lesser-included offense context, or, as the Court expressed it, if not technically a lesser-included offense, at least a species of lesser-included offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.063" offset="6248693">In Grady and in Vitale before it, the reckless driving by or traffic infractions that were the first prosecuted provided a basis on which you could infer at least either the establishment of recklessness, the element of the greater offense, or at least go a long way to establishing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.960" offset="6328314">As we've argued here, it's very different in contempt, because without knowing a fact of the case, the fact of what's in the court order, the violation... a violation such as assault with intent to kill or drug trafficking does not tend to establish any element of contempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="1576.646" offset="6447015">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.514" offset="6458509">The United States wants to prosecute Mr. Dixon and Mr. Foster for breaking the law after they have already been prosecuted for breaking these same laws in violation of court orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.406" offset="6506156">I have three points to cover with respect to the application of the double jeopardy clause in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.226" offset="6529353">First, if we could set aside just for a moment the special features of contempt, I think it would be clear that further prosecution here violates the double jeopardy clause under pre-Grady principles, and we think that the controlling principles are those in Harris and actually with respect to Dixon the principles of Brown v. Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.959" offset="6640321">As a matter of law, the offenses now being prosecuted were component offenses or elements of the offenses that were prosecuted first, so we don't think the Court needs to talk about conduct at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.803" offset="6703642">We think a facial examination of the applicable laws takes this Court to the principles of Harris or Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.259" offset="6737496">My second point would be that there should be no change in the Court's general rule that a comprehensive offense and a component offense are the same offense for double jeopardy purposes simply--</text>

            <text syncTime="1716.353" offset="7005931">I think that one of these cases, Foster, could be decided under the principles of Brown, that the crimes now being prosecuted constitute elements of the crimes previously prosecuted, and in Dixon, where the Court's order was, it is a crime to commit any crime, that that is comparable to the relationship of the two laws in Harris v. Oklahoma which was the felony murder statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.774" offset="7131527">And I think that the comparison... and this is really very important, and I think this is why Grady really isn't needed to decide the relationship in this case, is that we can make that comparison between the definition of the offenses being prosecuted simply by a facial examination of the laws, one a judge-made law, of course, that being the contempt, and the other a statutory law, but we don't have to ask about conduct or what the prosecutor's theory of the case was.</text>

            <text syncTime="2716.538" offset="11006636">So that in Foster's case, if in fact the assault had been committed, and if we assume, as I think we do commonly assume, that there's got to be some kind of a criminal rather than civil contempt remedy, it wouldn't have been any answer to the concern of the court... the legitimate concern of the court for the prosecutor to say, well, I'll bring in information and we'll put this down on the trial calendar and I will include a contempt count as well as a substantive assault count.</text>

            <text syncTime="3227.786" offset="13051606">If there's going to be a system, if the States are going to have a system of private prosecution, then it's going to be harder for them to comply with the double jeopardy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.176" offset="13097163">But this Court set up a system in Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.128" offset="13108971">This Court said, the cases should be referred to the public prosecutor, and then in Young, what we have was a full-scale policy decision by the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia not to treat contempts arising out of civil protection order violations as if they were criminal, and this Court said in Young, they're not part of the civil proceeding, they are criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.327" offset="13205833">If the U.S. Attorney or any prosecutor is going to squander the power that Young says the prosecutor should have, then I don't think it's legitimate for the prosecutor to be able to come back later and say that we were preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.936" offset="13264242">That's just bad prosecutorial policy, and that's what happened in both of these cases, and that's why these cases I think are something of an oddball.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.526" offset="13298620">These were not cases of the court's insisting on vindicating its authority right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.263" offset="13321503">The record in Foster in particular shows the judge saying, can you reach a settlement, have you talked to the U.S. Attorney's Office about it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.119" offset="13356925">I don't really care about any of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.336" offset="13365806">So we didn't have the court's viewing the vindication of their authority as requiring immediate action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.908" offset="13400079">I think that when we pull back from this case for a moment the Government is saying, it's easy, just treat contempt as different, but I think the Government is asking the Court to do something quite extraordinary.</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="3375.798" offset="13643645">Very briefly, first, with respect to the Young case, I think it's important to remember that Young was a supervisory power case that applied only to the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.856" offset="13695890">This problem that we're talking about, particularly the Foster case, which I think is the more widespread problem that this legal issue touches on, is essentially a State law question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.580" offset="13742806">It is no accident that this arises from the local courts in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.901" offset="13760046">This has been a problem that has come up in the local State courts much more frequently than it has in the Federal courts, and in those courts something like 41 different States have adopted a contempt provision as a means of enforcing civil protection orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.011" offset="13828487">It is a very important part of the procedures, and it isn't something that can easily be rolled into the criminal prosecution process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.385" offset="13865999">The individuals who are subject to these civil protection orders have already shown themselves not to be some people that are moved by the existence of general criminal liability for assault, and so forth, because when a civil protection order is obtained, it's generally on a showing that there has been an assault, or at least very clear threats of assault already.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.917" offset="13960144">They also are not moved, even after the civil protection order, by the fact that there is a civil protection order, because they have violated it, so they need to have some very specific and strong remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.725" offset="14011344">That's what contempt is for, and that's why it is so important to not water down the effect of contempt in this setting, and I would add one other point.</text>

            <text syncTime="3477.431" offset="14050215">What do you say to the suggestion that criminal contempt can be charged, preventive detention can be imposed in the Foster situation, and prosecution can take place subsequently in the normal course, so that as a practical matter you get the offender away from the victim?</text>

            <text syncTime="3494.875" offset="14120014">Well, contempt can clearly be charged, but in many States preventive detention is not available for offenses such as simple assault, and in fact I don't believe--</text>

            <text syncTime="3513.854" offset="14195873">--Well, I'm not sure the solution to the current problem is to get around the problem by creating the capacity for preventive detention for minor offenses and then using it for long periods of time, such as 6 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.613" offset="14250940">I think that's really using preventive detention to serve a purpose to get around the problem, that you really are holding him in contempt but you're calling it preventive detention and thereby avoiding the double jeopardy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.452" offset="14294303">I don't think that's really a satisfactory result, jurisprudentially.</text>

            <text syncTime="3541.606" offset="14306946">Yes, but to the extent that you're concerned that you need to make the contempt proceedings officially serious, is there any limit on the court's power to impose the same punishment they would impose they would impose in a criminal prosecution?</text>

            <text syncTime="3566.071" offset="14404749">But typically in these situations, that's not the case, and here the statute under which the proceeding was brought, the contempt statute in this particular case, had a limit of only 6 months to it... at least, the proceeding under the Intrafamily Act.</text>
