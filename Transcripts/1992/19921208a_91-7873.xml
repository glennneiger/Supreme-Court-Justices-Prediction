            <text syncTime="50.524" offset="338335">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="54.808" offset="355472">5 years ago today, there was a robbery in Jackson County of a Rax restaurant that gave rise to the... this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.416" offset="413881">I'd like to note that my opponent pointed that out to me, but it is an interesting coincidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.860" offset="443661">On February 29, 1988, a complaint was issued by the Jackson County sheriff's... or Jackson County prosecutor that showed that the residence of the defendant was the Fort Wayne, Indiana jail, and that's at the joint appendix on page 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.007" offset="540210">I don't have any specific references in the joint appendix between that date and September 7 of 1988, but on that day, my client, Mr. William Fex, signed a request for disposition under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.223" offset="637072">Between that date and September 26, 1988, there is again something of a void, but that is the date on which the prosecutor urges that they actually received the request for distribution... or request for disposition of the detainer, and that is the date that we will concede that they actually received the request for disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.075" offset="764549">The question here is does the signing of the request for disposition on September 7 or does the receipt of the request for disposition trigger the 180-day limitation on prosecution under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.286" offset="837379">From the time that my client was sentenced in Indiana until he was transferred to Michigan for prosecution in this present case, he was effectively prevented from participating in any rehabilitation at the prison in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.661" offset="926822">And that is the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.764" offset="939256">That is the injury here.</text>

            <text syncTime="212.021" offset="984291">No, there wasn't any opportunity because at the time that the complaint was issued... and I cannot believe that the Michigan prosecutor's office didn't have some kind of communication with the Indiana prosecutor's office and the court there.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.164" offset="1064853">This was before he was sentenced in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.636" offset="1078750">It was before he was convicted, as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.088" offset="1088572">From the time that he was convicted, there was at least a hold, if not a technical detainer--</text>

            <text syncTime="250.516" offset="1138309">And I would like to point out that a complaint is one of the documents that is listed under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.913" offset="1175821">And so, from the day that he was sentenced, I believe that was in... on or about April 26, he was under the act, and he should have been notified.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.043" offset="1236321">But he was not notified until September 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.475" offset="1246143">I would like to make three points here during my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.659" offset="1278848">The first point is that the injury here is not merely to my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.292" offset="1301418">It is an injury to the society as a whole because it prevents the rehabilitation of the prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.447" offset="1325973">I would also like to stress that the prisoner here is not in control.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.312" offset="1353454">The prosecutor in the receiving State and the jailers are in control.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.775" offset="1375292">They are in very firm control, and by manipulating the paperwork properly, they can either ensure a prompt disposition or they can delay it.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.553" offset="1422417">Thirdly, I would like to--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="326.184" offset="1440912">That may be a policy argument, but it may be that the language of the statute makes it an argument that ought to be addressed in the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.240" offset="1469124">I mean, it does say caused to be delivered, doesn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="335.651" offset="1478841">--Justice Scalia, I don't think that the language of the statute is sufficiently clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.150" offset="1528788">We have the statute which says that the prosecutor shall have 180 days after the prisoner shall have caused to be delivered this request.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.348" offset="1577584">Now, you have three concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.609" offset="1586675">One is that the prisoner makes a demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.272" offset="1601303">Two is that the demand is transmitted through his jailers, and three, that there's 180 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.105" offset="1628575">And I think that from a grammatical standpoint or from a logical standpoint, the requirement of the 180 days will follow the other two requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.747" offset="1687194">So, the natural way that you would say this is that the prisoner makes a demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.509" offset="1706211">He gives it to the jailer, and then there's 180 days that the prosecutor has to bring the action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2779.575" offset="11254489">My... I would suggest that the answer to that comes from the drafting history, which we discuss in our brief beginning at page 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.530" offset="11282283">The drafters note... pardon me... the Council of State Governments, which opposed the IAD in 1957, actually proposed two State... two agreement proposals at the same time, one based on interstate detainers and one governing intrastate detainers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.842" offset="11355530">The speedy trial provisions in both proposals were virtually identical, and the council noted that the intrastate proposal was based on statutes then in effect in California and Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.079" offset="11400565">Both the California and Oregon statutes plainly required actual receipt for triggering of the speedy trial provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.174" offset="11432853">We suggest that the drafters did not intend to change the actual receipt requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.737" offset="11455109">The relevant differences between the State models on which the IAD was based and the IAD itself is the wording requiring the prisoner to have caused delivery of the required documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.776" offset="11507354">There are two reasons for that wording requiring the prisoner to cause delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.689" offset="11526998">First is the whole topic of article III is that the prisoner has initiated the process of disposing of the charges underlying the detainer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.124" offset="11560748">The fact that the prisoner has initiated the process is what distinguishes article III from article IV, which deals with when the State initiates the process of disposing of the charges.</text>

            <text syncTime="2950.295" offset="11937330">The scheme of article III focuses on the prisoner's having initiated the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.659" offset="11954884">And so, using the prisoner as the subject of the relevant clause we're talking about makes sense in understanding why article III is different from article IV of the IAD because article IV is directed at the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.268" offset="12005248">And, of course, the other reason for using the word cause in the relevant wording is that the prisoner does not make an actual delivery directly to the court and the prosecutor in the receiving State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.236" offset="12053104">Instead, under article III(c), he is required to give his request for disposition to the wardens who are then required to promptly forward it to the receiving State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.630" offset="12090721">That's why the causing language is in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.965" offset="12108066">And... but the gist of article III is to require a communication between the prisoner and the prosecutor in the receiving State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.738" offset="12139204">And it is only when that communication, namely, the prisoner's request for disposition, has been completed that the prosecutor's duty to bring the prisoner to trial in a speedy manner begins, and that he cannot know of his duty to do so until he has actually received the request for disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.681" offset="12210884">The other point about the relevant language of article III I'd like to repeat is one that Justice Souter raised, which is that the drafters could easily have drafted article III(a) to trigger the 180-day period to begin when the prisoner sent or gave his request for disposition to the warden officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.924" offset="12295939">In fact, the language of giving or sending is included in article III(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.318" offset="12313493">Therefore, it would have been natural, had the drafters intended to adopt petitioner's rule, for them to have used similar language in article III(a).</text>

            <text syncTime="3447.355" offset="13925666">But it's my understanding that if we just have a warrant, that a warrant would not constitute a detainer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.737" offset="13951161">It's only after the prosecutor's office issues a complaint or an indictment or a detainer that we actually have a document that is recognized under the IAD.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.266" offset="14001316">And I would like to suggest that, as Justice White has suggested, that when the prisoner has delivered the paperwork to the prison authorities, he has caused the request for detainer to be delivered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.409" offset="14081878">And I ask the Court to rule in the only way that does not eviscerate the Interstate Agreement on Detainers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.024" offset="14112285">If you rule in favor of the petitioner, you have a bright line test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.388" offset="14133705">The problem of competing requests for detainer can be dealt with in the way that the paperwork is handled, and the statute provides for a continuance when the prisoner unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.247" offset="14197235">It does not affect the... a prisoner-sent request for detainer, which was the problem in a number of cases because when you have a prisoner sending it himself, there are problems in proving when it was sent and proving when it was received.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.958" offset="14268079">But it's no more difficult for the prosecutor to prove when the prisoner tended the request for disposition to the prison than it would be for the prisoner to prove that... when the prosecutor received it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.998" offset="14320219">And I want to stress that we are talking about the prisoner tendering the request for disposition to the agent of the prosecutor who is initiating the detainer or the complaint or the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.968" offset="14388033">And the prosecutor, if he wants to do so, can exert perfect control over when the paperwork is processed, how it is processed, and what kinds of records are kept in order to ensure that it's not lost along the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.360" offset="14453653">A very simple log will ensure that we don't have the kinds of problem that we have here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3589.506" offset="14494195">If you look at subsection (a), I think one must acknowledge that there is some room for ambiguity in the shall have caused to be delivered as to whether you look to the place of causing... to the time of causing or the time of delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.688" offset="14566920">But if you skip down to the end of that same section, the last sentence says the request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by a certificate of the appropriate official.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.625" offset="14610701">Now, that last sentence is obviously taking a viewpoint at the time of delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.262" offset="14645287">Certainly at the time he makes the request, at the time he gives his request to the warden, it is not accompanied by this document.</text>
