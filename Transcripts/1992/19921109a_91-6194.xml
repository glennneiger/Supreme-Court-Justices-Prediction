            <text syncTime="156.247" offset="763581">First of all, the advisory committee notes that are appended to the rule specifically speak of the defendant's... the defendant's presence being a necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.910" offset="802243">Rule 4... the advisory committee note to Rule 43(b) says that a defendant may be tried only if he... if he leaves after the trial beings, and cites the Diaz case.</text>

            <text syncTime="497.987" offset="2130517">My point is that the rule, as it was previously written, permitted the result in Illinois v. Allen.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.262" offset="2159670">Here, we don't have anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.933" offset="2166357">We have... we would have to basically engraft an exception onto Rule 43 that was not within the contemplation of the drafters.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.885" offset="2190076">The reason that Rule 43 wasn't... or was intended to address the situation of the defendant not initially present is obvious from the notes appended to the first draft of Rule 43, and this was in 1943, in which the initial draft read that a defendant has the right to be present at arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.888" offset="2270115">And the Government says, well, later that was changed to shall be present, and the reason it was changed to shall be present was just to avoid a defendant from exercising a right of... his right of presence by not attending, by opting not to attend.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.517" offset="2316613">And it appears that the present version of the rule, the one that says the defendant shall be present, was proposed by Judge Sanborn of the Eighth Circuit, and this was in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.274" offset="2355692">And his notes or his version of Rule 43 has appended to it his own comment, which is that, quote:</text>
            <text syncTime="562.819" offset="2389861">I think it would be inadvisable to conduct criminal trials in the absence of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.582" offset="2404907">That has never been the practice, and whether the defendant wants to attend the trial or not, I think he should be compelled to be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.505" offset="2428626">If, during trial, he disappears, there is, of course, no reason why he should... the trial should not proceed without him.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.321" offset="2455898">So this is the person who proposed, apparently, the draft that we have right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.663" offset="2473244">And that person, Judge Sanborn, obviously didn't feel that the common law permitted the trial in absentia of a defendant who wasn't present.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.408" offset="2500202">And if you look at the first advisory committee note appended to the first draft of Rule 43, that... and this is the draft that says the defendant simply has a right to be present, it doesn't say he shall be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.927" offset="2550252">This is the very first advisory committee draft and it says:</text>
            <text syncTime="606.340" offset="2563941">The second sentence permits continuing with the trial in a felony case not punishable by death or in a misdemeanor case when the defendant, by his voluntary act, absents himself after the commencement of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.159" offset="2607199">Under this provision the defendant is required to be present at arraignment, at plea, and the trial must begin in his presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.630" offset="2633113">So the first published draft of Rule 43 had that appended to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="664.919" offset="2798207">The Government says that the... the right to be present versus shall be present is indicative only of an attempt to prevent a defendant from exercising his right of presence by not attending.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.675" offset="2833315">But it's... the point I'm making here is that the person who... Judge Sanborn who proposed the present draft or the present wording of the rule, when he did that, included that language, which was that it is inadvisable to conduct criminal trials in the absence of the defendant, and that has never been the practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.598" offset="2900920">So the judge who's proposing that language is saying we just don't try defendants in their absence, and it's obvious what the committee was... its intent or its view of the law was at the time it proposed... proposed this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.235" offset="2951493">If one looks at what... well, not only... staying with the drafting history for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.950" offset="2986393">The Government's brief cites at page 19, note 6, a proposed amendment to the draft or to rule 43, a 1973 proposed amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.139" offset="3031115">That amendment would have covered the situation we have here where a defendant does not appear for the beginning of his trial, and that amendment would have permitted the trial to proceed in that defendant's absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.875" offset="3066119">The significance of that is that the rule... if the rule did not... if the rule permitted that, it wouldn't have been necessary to add that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.831" offset="3101854">And the fact that the committee rejected it shows that the committee didn't want the rule to permit the trial in absentia of a defendant who wasn't present.</text>

            <text syncTime="795.716" offset="3321492">And even though the... factually, the defendant in that case was initially present, that doesn't lessen or detract the force of that common law rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.510" offset="3348659">And that's what this... or the advisory committee and this Court was adopting when it promulgated Rule 43.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.134" offset="3371124">If one looks at the advisory committee note to Rule 43, the exact page of the Diaz opinion is the one cited, the page where the common law rule is discussed, page 455.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.714" offset="3417413">So it's obvious that when the advisory committee was thinking about Diaz, it was thinking about that common law rule that doesn't admit a defendant to be tried unless he's initially present.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.730" offset="3453462">The common law and case law origins of Rule 40... I've been talking mainly about the advisory committee treatment of the rule, and that, obviously, deals with the common law and case law origins of Rule 43.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.609" offset="3525038">But if one looks at some of the important State cases cited in Diaz, it's obvious that no one was tried in his absence if he didn't show up for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.137" offset="3559101">The case of Commonwealth v. McCarthy specifically said it is irregular and improper to begin trial without the presence of the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.772" offset="3589612">In State v. Way, a Kansas case, 1907, trial cannot begin in his absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.043" offset="3610719">In Feit v. State, an Ohio case from 1835, the court said the trial cannot begin in the defendant's absence, but if he leaves during the trial it may proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.500" offset="3648545">So Diaz summarized... gathered together and summarized all the State cases in arriving at what the common law and discerning what the common law said about trial in absentia.</text>

            <text syncTime="991.704" offset="4105374">And our position would be that there was no waiver of the constitutional right of presence because nothing in the record shows that the petitioner was ever told that if he didn't appear, that the trial could proceed in his absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.052" offset="4150827">And I don't know, in this context at least, prior to trial, how one could have a knowing, voluntary, and intelligence waiver if one didn't know the consequence of absconding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.878" offset="4182070">We have in this case... or in this country no common law tradition of trial in absentia, which is another reason why a defendant who leaves prior to trial could not be presumed to have waived the constitutional right of presence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1050.732" offset="4341521">That's not the situation as to a defendant prior to trial who's never been advised of the consequences and who is not in the midst of a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.137" offset="4367121">In 19... I was mentioning earlier that in 1973 the common law... or, I'm sorry, the advisory committee proposed an amendment to Rule 43 that would have addressed this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1100.077" offset="4538902">In other words, in 1973 the proposed amendment said or recognized that the current requirement is that the defendant has to be present and trial cannot proceed without him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1140.404" offset="4700235">The advisory or the drafting history of the rule is... or contradicts that and, as in the case of Commonwealth v. Felton, there are no cases prior to Rule 43 that permit a trial in absentia of a defendant not initially present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.903" offset="4758226">The structure of the rule also argues against the result... or the Government's point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.007" offset="4790618">The Government says that Rule 43 doesn't address this, but it's odd that if, in drafting a rule, the only waiver provision contemplated has to do with the defendant who is initially present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.946" offset="4838370">In other words, if the rule were going to be drafted to permit the result the Government wants, it would have been a simple matter to make the waiver provision include not only defendants initially present but also those who are not initially present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.732" offset="4881524">So the structure of the rule argues against the Government's... the result the Government wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.268" offset="4903676">The Government argues that defendants will be able to manipulate the system if the rule is interpreted as we ask it to be interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.224" offset="4939516">Well, the Government's concerns about defendants holding up trials and flaunting justice obviously had to have been known to the drafters of the rule, and the Government's argument now seeks to elevate that concern above the rule that was drafted in awareness of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.473" offset="4992492">There is at least one State that has specifically, by case law, prohibited trying a defendant not initially present and that's Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.420" offset="5028228">I'm not aware of any problem that Pennsylvania has had in trying its defendants and in making sure that its court system operates smoothly and efficiently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.806" offset="5065844">There are means to discourage defendants who are not initially... or who are on bail and contemplate absconding prior to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.074" offset="5118821">We don't have to go to the extreme of holding the trials in their absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.149" offset="5139196">Defendants can be required, as a condition of their release, to appear at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.792" offset="5157795">If they don't, they know that their bail will be forfeited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.454" offset="5168349">As I mentioned earlier, a defendant who's been given... or who's been released prior to trial could be... have his bail revoked or he could be detained initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.510" offset="5204607">There just is no reason why we have to go to the extreme of trying defendants who are not initially present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.226" offset="5227490">The implications of the Court's decision should be important in the result... in reaching the result that we're asking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.383" offset="5272107">First of all, if the Court finds that a defendant not initially present can be tried in spite of the clear language of the rule, it's going to be creating a wedge effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.891" offset="5306171">The Government will be seeking to try defendants at an earlier and earlier stage of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.222" offset="5323516">The next stage, obviously, will be the defendant who hasn't been arraigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.106" offset="5338981">Now, arraignment is a precondition of trial, or is a sine qua non of trial, but if the Government is able to succeed in this case in having the rule ignored, then why not ignore the part of the rule that says the defendant cannot be tried unless he's been arraigned?</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.914" offset="5402197">And the requirement that the defendant be arraigned prior to trial is the same part of the rule requiring his presence at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.949" offset="5430409">So what the Court would be doing here is creating a precedent for interpreting the requirement of presence at arraignment to be superfluous, to not really mean what it says.</text>

            <text syncTime="2325.957" offset="9442399">Around the time that this proposal I was just speaking of came up, this Court had granted cert in Tacon v.

            <text syncTime="2354.578" offset="9556920">The... I'd like to return to the lower courts, because ever since Rule 43 was adopted the lower courts have unanimously held that waiver is appropriate in these situations if the public interest in proceeding with the trial outweighs the defendant's interest in being present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.430" offset="9628287">Those decisions are significant in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.941" offset="9638318">First at all... first of all, they cast serious doubt on petitioner's contention that the plain language of Rule 43 supports his reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.566" offset="9664858">Now, if the language were so plain, so many Federal courts of appeals would not have decided the question against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.299" offset="9691817">And secondly, all of the court of appeals decisions have been grounded on common reasoning, which simply is... is that just as a defendant may waive his right to be present at trial by absconding once the trial begins, he may also waive the right by... by absconding before the trial begins.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.050" offset="9754824">That approach fully protects the defendant's right to be present by giving him an opportunity to show up, but at the same time it prevents the sort of calculated manipulation of the judicial system that's involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.188" offset="9803307">The lower courts take a two-part inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.060" offset="9814801">The first is directed to whether the defendant's absence is, in fact, knowing and voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.942" offset="9834341">Once that's determined, it does not mean that the... that automatically trial in absentia goes forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.817" offset="9857851">Instead, the courts have gone on to determine whether the public interest in proceeding outweighs the defendant's interest in being present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.541" offset="9884705">In fact, the decisions in this case below illustrate the care with which the lower courts have approached this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.546" offset="9912812">The trial court judge was faced with a very difficult situation on the morning of October 12, 1988 when this trial was scheduled to go forward.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark D. Nyvold</label>
            <text syncTime="2809.666" offset="11377237">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.518" offset="11380685">The Government is arguing now that Rule 43 doesn't address this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.551" offset="11404822">Although this isn't... or terribly significant, it is important that the interpretation the Government is urging now is not the one the Government took at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.147" offset="11439199">At page 15 of the joint appendix, the prosecutor said when this subject came up, the possibility of trying Mr. Crosby in absentia... the prosecutor said: The rule appears to require that the defendant be there at the beginning of the trial and that you proceed if he takes off, and that is usually the way it happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.789" offset="11501684">The Government went on to urge or to cite the many circuits that have said this is okay to do, but it's significant that the reading that they are giving the rule now is not the reading that they gave the rule when the question first arose.</text>

            <text syncTime="2851.914" offset="11546197">Well, I don't understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.804" offset="11553825">What... what... what... how did they... what reason did they give there?</text>

            <text syncTime="2856.957" offset="11566364">Well, the prosecutor... when the question arose, let's think about trying Mr. Crosby in absentia, the prosecutor got out the rule and her comment was, quote: The rule appears to require that the defendant be there at the beginning of the trial and that you proceed if he takes off, and that is usually the way it happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.947" offset="11626341">In other words, the prosecutor--</text>

            <text syncTime="2872.949" offset="11630416">Well, but... but, in fairness, the Government goes on to say: But the cases indicate you can proceed against him in his absence even if he's not there at the outset of the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2880.182" offset="11659255">--Yes, Justice Kennedy, that was the point I was making, that the Government went on to urge the cases, or to cite the cases in the circuits that permit the--</text>

            <text syncTime="2887.959" offset="11690393">Well, I assume the Government was saying that this is the way the rule has been interpreted by the courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2891.859" offset="11705962">--Well, the plain reading, or the reading the prosecutor was giving it was not the one the Government is giving it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.375" offset="11728114">That's the only point I'm making.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.045" offset="11734801">I'm not saying that's dispositive of the case, but they are being... the Government is inconsistent in its argument.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="2903.848" offset="11753923">Well, he was... but he did... he did point out that apparently the courts of appeals knew more about the rule than he did.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_d_nyvold" startTime="2909.663" stopTime="3067.999">
            <label>Mr. Mark D. Nyvold</label>
            <text syncTime="2909.663" offset="11777224">No, the prosecutor then cited the cases or went on to urge that the cases indicate you can proceed... proceed against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.867" offset="11806063">The Government, or the solicitor, made the statement that a defendant can be proceeded against even if he or she is not at the arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.934" offset="11850262">I don't know of any authority for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.396" offset="11856114">It's... arraignment, at least under Crane v. United States, is an absolute to... prerequisite to proceeding against a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.969" offset="11886416">And in Crane, the defendant's conviction was reversed because, although he was present at every other proceeding, the defendant had never been arraigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.745" offset="11913583">So I don't know any authority for that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.426" offset="11924241">The circuit court opinions make the... make some rather facile distinctions in getting around Rule 43.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.863" offset="11970008">They say that since the defendant can waive his presence at any early stage of the trial when some fairly... or less significant events like jury selection are going on, and he... why can't he waive it at the beginning of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.373" offset="12020058">That clouds the reasoning behind the common law rule, which was to draw a bright line at the beginning of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.584" offset="12040956">The common law has recognized, as does Rule 43, that a defendant can waive the right of presence after the trial begins, but to reason that... within those parameters, that because he can waive it during different stages, that he can waive it prior to the trial is illogical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.323" offset="12095918">It's taking the common law rule and basically pulling the rug out from under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.279" offset="12119741">That's not what the common law did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.551" offset="12128832">It didn't permit the trial in absentia prior... if the defendant wasn't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.065" offset="12146804">The Government took some pains to point out that Mr. Crosby's presence appears to have been deliberate and calculated to postpone the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.603" offset="12192989">This, again, was a circumstance well-known to the common law and well-known to the drafters of the rule, and yet they didn't write the rule to distinguish between defendants who are absent through no fault of their own and those who deliberately abscond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.662" offset="12245234">That's just irrelevant under the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.723" offset="12253488">The Government makes the point that a defendant, if the rule is interpreted as we urge, will have an incentive to leave at an early stage of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.761" offset="12301658">Well, a defendant has an incentive to leave prior to arraignment since it's obvious the defendant can't be proceeded against if he hasn't been arraigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.216" offset="12327467">So if there's an incentive to leave at an early stage, it occurs prior to the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.059" offset="12350768">That would be the smartest point at which to abscond, is prior to arraignment, since no one disputes that a defendant cannot be tried if he hasn't been arraigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.921" offset="12378249">The point that... the question that Justice--</text>

            <text syncTime="3067.999" offset="12410537">The arraignment, though... if the defendant absconds before he's arraigned, the State has not marshaled the witnesses and that sort of thing for the arraignment the way they would have for the trial, so the... the amount of inconvenience is considerably different.</text>

            <text syncTime="3084.178" offset="12475320">But the common law recognized that it was only at the point at which the trial began that that inconvenience factor would weigh... would predominate and favor... and permit the trial of a defendant who's not initially present.</text>
