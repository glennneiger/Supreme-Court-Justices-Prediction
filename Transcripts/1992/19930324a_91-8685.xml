            <text syncTime="13.510" offset="183488">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.452" offset="195191">This Court has framed the question presented in Mr. Stinson's case as whether a court's failure to follow Sentencing Guideline commentary that gives specific direction that the offense of unlawful possession of a firearm by felony is not a crime of violence under Sentencing Guideline, section 4B1.1, and seeing section 4B.1.2's commentary note to whether that failure constitutes an incorrect application of the Sentencing Guidelines under 18 U.S.C. section 3742 (f)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="52.366" offset="338865">First, some background, the chronology.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.238" offset="354329">Mr. Stinson committed his crimes, which included being a felon in possession of a firearm unlawfully, in October-November of 1989.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.182" offset="390169">Mr. Stinson was sentenced in July of 1990, applying the November 1989 Sentencing Guideline manual, section 4B1.1, and the district court treated the felon in possession of a firearm charge as the necessary predicate for the career offender provision of the Sentencing Guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.446" offset="467178">Then, in October of 1991, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court's sentence, affirmed the sentence of a career fender... offender, treating the predicate offense of possession of a firearm by a felon as a crime of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.117" offset="533843">Then just days after the Eleventh Circuit's opinion came out affirming the sentence, on November 1st, 1991 the United States Sentencing Commission issued clarifying commentary, and that was amendment 433 stating that it was the Sentencing Commission's intent that the definition of crime of violence, for career offender purposes, did not include the crime of possession of a firearm by a felon.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.896" offset="652961">In a timely manner, before Mr. Stinson's judgment and sentence was final on appeal, Mr. Stinson petitioned for rehearing to the Eleventh Circuit, basing his petition for rehearing on this clarifying amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.337" offset="718789">In March of 1992 the Eleventh Circuit in an opinion denied the petition for rehearing, holding that the Eleventh Circuit would not be bound by Sentencing Commission commentary.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.085" offset="769780">This Court, in Williams v. United States just last term, held that a court's failure to follow Sentencing Commission policy statements can result in a misapplication of the Guidelines under section 3742(f).</text>

            <text syncTime="1240.695" offset="5092210">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.043" offset="5137558">We agree with the petitioner that the Sentencing Commission's interpretation of its Guidelines is entitled to deference from the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.398" offset="5163054">In fact, we probably take an even more pro-deference position than the petitioner does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.768" offset="5180504">In our view, the court should give effect to the Sentencing Commission's interpretations of its own Guidelines in the same way that the courts would give effect to a Federal agency's interpretations of its own legislative rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.187" offset="5226166">In fact, we think that's a reasonable place to start to analyze this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.579" offset="5239749">The Sentencing Guidelines can reasonably be analogized to a Federal agency's legislative rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.123" offset="5261901">After all, the Guidelines are not just a collection of advice to district courts about how to impose sentence in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.697" offset="5288233">On the contrary, as this Court explained in the Mistretta case, the Sentencing Guidelines bind courts in the exercise of their sentencing authority, such as the Federal rules of criminal, civil, and appellate procedure bind courts in the management and disposition of the cases before them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1310.580" offset="5371720">I think for... for this sort of purpose, Your Honor, they would be treated in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.664" offset="5388020">There are differences under the Sentencing Reform Act between guidelines, policy, and policy statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.547" offset="5415606">For example, there are certain times when Congress will refer to guidelines and other times when Congress will refer to policy statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.412" offset="5443087">For example, in one of the statutes that we've cited that is relevant, we think, to the proper disposition of this case, section 3582(c)(2), which we have reprinted in our appendix beginning at page 5a, Congress has set forth a procedure that is to be followed so that a sentence that is already imposed can thereafter be reduced if the Sentencing Commission reduces the offense level for that sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.639" offset="5547994">If you flip over to page 6a, in subsection... what is (c)(2) towards the bottom, you will see that it says, skipping down through part of it,</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.436" offset="5587178">"the court may reduce the term of imprisonment after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a). "</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.230" offset="5610375">that's in title 18,</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.091" offset="5613823">"to the extent that they are applicable. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.802" offset="5620615">and</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.663" offset="5624063">"if such a reduction is consistent with. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.673" offset="5632109">here's the phrase,</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.625" offset="5635870">"applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.426" offset="5647155">So in that context, Congress clearly has specified a policy statement and the Commission has implemented that demand... that command from Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.549" offset="5675576">What the Sentencing Commission did was adopt a policy statement, which we have also reprinted in our brief... that's in the appendix that is, and that's at page 9a.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.016" offset="5713506">It's section 1B1.10 of the Guidelines manual and it governs the situations in which a retroactive application of a guideline or a policy statement amendment, or commentary, we think, should be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.366" offset="5770871">That, we think, is the way Congress has generally set out the sort of problem that ultimately we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.402" offset="5803054">One way to look at it, as the term has been used, is to look at it in terms of retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.475" offset="5823325">The threshold question, however, is one, like I said, we with... one with which we agree with the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.669" offset="5848089">We didn't argue to the contrary in the court of appeals at the rehearing stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.923" offset="5865121">In fact, our submission at the rehearing stage in the Eleventh Circuit was that it ought not to apply this amendment because the amendment was not in effect at the time of sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.819" offset="5900647">And so the position we've taken here in this Court is the position that the Department believes best implements the Sentencing Reform Act and best uses the available types of judicial doctrines in a manner that makes it efficient and reasonable for the courts to apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="1492.841" offset="6100745">The legislative history oftentimes will sometimes explain how a statute is to be implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.193" offset="6122166">That happened frequently with respect to the Sentencing Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.675" offset="6132092">There was a rather comprehensive report by the Senate committee that was issued... that accompanies the Sentencing Reform Act, and it gave rather a elaborate explanation of how the Congress thought its provisions would work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.254" offset="6182456">And in this case, I think what the Sentencing Commission is getting at is when we issue an explanation of how a Guideline should be implemented, you should look to it the same way you look... you would look to a legislative report explaining how a statute is to be implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.815" offset="6236687">I don't think they meant to say that since legislative history is normally disregarded, you should normally disregard what we've had to say.</text>

            <text syncTime="2115.010" offset="8589483">If you look at page 75 of the joint appendix you'll see the statement of reasons given by the district court as to why... excuse me, statement of reasons at page 84.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.147" offset="8633996">Statement of reasons at page 84 is why the district court imposed the sentence at the upper end of the Guidelines, and it believed that a sentence at the upper end of the Guideline range was necessary because the defendant had a history of violent behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.106" offset="8693869">The court earlier, at page 75, had said unless there were a very stiff sentence imposed on this defendant, the court would have considered departing upwards from the Guidelines range.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.613" offset="8735874">So what you have is a case here where the district court has said this is a person that needs a long term of incarceration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2369.836" offset="9608781">The point that Justice Scalia was making, I think I addressed this or the Second Circuit has in the Carter case, and this is at page 29 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.603" offset="9655802">And I quoted from the opinion in which the court, Second Circuit, stated</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.266" offset="9678476">"Effective November 1, 1992, a revision to section 1B1.10(d) of the Sentencing Guidelines establishes retroactively that a felon-in-possession conviction under section 922(g)(1) is never a crime of violence for purposes of section 4B1.1.

            <text syncTime="2408.780" offset="9764576">After oral argument and upon learning of this revision, the Government informed this court that it does not oppose remand or resentencing in conformity with this Guideline's amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.489" offset="9819328">Accordingly, we remand for resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.530" offset="9827583">Now, it's not absolutely clear what the Second Circuit meant by that, but I believe that what that meant was that they were remanding for resentencing in conformity with the amendment and that the defendant/appellant would be sentenced not as a career offender.</text>
