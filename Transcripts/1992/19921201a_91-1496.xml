            <text syncTime="200.145" offset="945573">Certainly the shipper has an interest, and after Maislin has an interest that is quite significant in insuring that the tariffs are in fact filed, but the duty itself clearly resides with the carrier under these circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.661" offset="1043689">It is true in a theoretical sense that the shipper has access, but I think it is as a practical matter quite unreasonable to expect the shipper to be able consistently to monitor changing tariff rates that can be implemented on 24-hours notice, when if you were to just look at the Carolina tariffs they are six volumes long, they reference additional tariffs that are themselves three and four volumes long.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.692" offset="1143790">We're talking about tariff filings that are in the nature of thousands of pages, Justice O'Connor.</text>

            <text syncTime="270.872" offset="1228532">As to some portions they would have been, some of the earlier shipments I think would have been barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.891" offset="1244623">Later shipments would not have been barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.675" offset="1251728">So we're not in the more, I think more typical situation where the trustee has brought the suit for undercharges at a period in time when the shippers are not permitted to seek reparations.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="288.833" offset="1300316">And does the time barr affect the ability under your position to go back to the ICC for the reasonableness determination?</text>

          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="298.589" stopTime="372.504">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="298.589" offset="1339395">Absolutely, Justice O'Connor, that is this Court's decision in United States v. Western Pacific where the Court held that where the United States refused to pay and was sued for undercharges and the carriers, the carrier in that case, just as the respondents in this case, said the way to do this is to pay the filed rate and seek reparations.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.936" offset="1420793">And the Court said that's, you can't do that because reparations are time-barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.638" offset="1439601">And in language that I think is strikingly appropriate for this particular case the Court said to hold otherwise would require the Court to condone a situation where the carrier is permitted to obtain unreasonable rates with impunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.481" offset="1498951">That is precisely the situation that we have here because everyone conceded at the court of appeals level that if these rates turn out to be unreasonable they are essentially lost because the carrier is insolvent and it's going to be impossible to recoup monies.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.591" offset="1559346">Under those circumstances what you have is a situation where the shipper's significant right under the statute not to be charged unreasonable rates is essentially vitiated in favor of an unbending absolute rule under the filed rate doctrine, which this Court has never held to be applicable in that particular way.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="372.504" stopTime="384.229">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="372.504" offset="1634997">Could the bankruptcy court collect the full amount of the filed rate and just hold it until such time as you have had a reasonable opportunity to go to the ICC?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="384.229" stopTime="452.023">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="384.229" offset="1681913">The bankruptcy court, I think there's no question the bankruptcy court would have that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.764" offset="1696124">The problem with that particular approach is, first of all there's nothing in the court of appeals' opinion that would authorize that because the court of appeals has categorically denied us the opportunity to stay the payment and there is nothing in any of the bankruptcy court or the Fourth Circuit's analysis that even envisions that kind of a procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.792" offset="1768221">So it's not really in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.577" offset="1775327">But second of all, in, given the magnitude of the undercharges that are at issue here it seems quite extraordinary to think about billions of dollars being placed in the registry when there is no serious reason to wonder whether in fact these charges are reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.020" offset="1841155">In fact the more likely scenario is that these charges are quite unreasonable, having not been reviewed as they have increased over the period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.193" offset="1873756">And therefore it seems to us the more appropriate course is if a carrier has reason to believe that a shipper will be unable to pay the filed rate if ultimately determined to be reasonable, then it seems to me the shipper, or, excuse me, the carrier can come forward in either the bankruptcy court or before the ICC and seek to have some protection put in place.</text>

            <text syncTime="786.555" offset="3291265">The whole reason why this issue is before the Court today is that there is a rash of collection actions throughout the motor carrier industry in which bankrupt carriers or their trustees are culling through old tariffs and seeking to collect monies that are substantially in excess of what were charged at the time, and they are doing so in a way that gives the shippers no opportunity to challenge the reasonableness of those rates in a way that would be effective.</text>

            <text syncTime="858.151" offset="3577671">That underlying principle was also expressed in this Court's decision in Crancer v.

            <text syncTime="1629.329" offset="6662315">That is a ridiculous concept because it ignores the principal provision of the Interstate Commerce Act, that is that filed rates are constructively deemed to know, that shippers are constructively deemed to know at the time of shipment what the rate is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1932.820" offset="7876277">The only way you can enforce that rates be reasonable is that the public has knowledge of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1938.908" offset="7900623">In 1887 Congress developed a statutory scheme that said publicity of rates, once we publish our rates the world will know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.415" offset="7938657">And at that point the question presented was well, what do you do about determining the reasonableness?</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.367" offset="7958510">In the past the courts could adjudicate the issue of reasonableness because there was no ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.421" offset="7978677">Once the ICC was created the courts were to stand back and not decide the issue of reasonableness, but the courts were to enforce the filed rate doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="2019.389" offset="8222556">Now all of a sudden a shipper says well, you're rates are under investigation, I'm not going to pay that whole rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3252.693" offset="13155833">Just a couple of quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.860" offset="13164506">First of all I would like to clarify the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.412" offset="13178716">Mr. Steinfeld suggested that the shippers in this case were informed that the rates would not be filed and therefore acted essentially at their own peril.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.404" offset="13226677">What that letter actually says just prior to the reference to what rates were going to be charged is, I'm not sending you the tariff because it is, quote, voluminous, and you need not worry about it though because we're going to go ahead and take care of this in a filed tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.462" offset="13282893">So the truth is that the shippers did rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.014" offset="13293133">It's ultimately not terribly important to the outcome of the case, but it's important to set that record straight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.401" offset="13310582">With respect to the idea that there was either collusion or discrimination in this case, that's nonsense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.770" offset="13332107">This is a shipper who... these are brokers, small brokers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.388" offset="13346527">They don't have any market power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.872" offset="13352483">They use 15 different carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.674" offset="13359693">All 15 of those carriers charge precisely the same rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.142" offset="13373590">And in fact if you look at the carrier's tariffs in this case, they have tariffs that look very similar for other shippers to the rates that they charged here, they just didn't bother to file those tariffs for this particular shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.468" offset="13426879">So what happened here is clearly just malfeasance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.868" offset="13436493">He talks about the malfeasance of the Interstate Commerce Commission in how it approached this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.039" offset="13453211">I find it incredibly mystifying to sit here and say that we have erred because we failed to exercise constructive knowledge when it's obvious that from the beginning the carriers had an obligation to charge and collect the filed rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.197" offset="13505769">They chose not to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.632" offset="13511516">They charged a different rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.649" offset="13519666">And to suggest that somehow at the outset of this process under section 10743 that we had some duty to come back to them and say, sir, you have undercharged us, you need to expect more out of us, is ridiculous because--</text>

            <text syncTime="3443.264" offset="13918086">I mean the essential injustice here is an injustice that you concede is there in the act, that the carrier who was at fault for all of this can nonetheless come and collect the rate, and if he happens to go insolvent the next day you're just straight out of luck.</text>

            <text syncTime="3461.942" offset="13992796">I acknowledge that it's there in the statute as a timing issue at the outset when the payment, when the shipment is delivered and there is a requirement of payment.</text>
