            <text syncTime="25.407" offset="217345">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="29.760" offset="234795">Petitioner's husband, John Emmett Smith travelled to Antarctica as an employee of a Government contractor, and because of the Government's negligence died in Antarctica.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.649" offset="286308">This case comes under the Federal Tort Claims Act, the sole avenue by which Mrs. Smith can sue the Government, and concerns the proper construction of the act's foreign country exception, which the Government contends bar jurisdiction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.892" offset="351301">Petitioner maintains that the sole purpose of the foreign country exception is to ensure that the United States' liability under the act is not governed by the tort law of a foreign power.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.688" offset="406472">It is undisputed here that Antarctica is a sovereignless region and has no civil tort law of its own, and therefore Petitioner maintains that Antarctica cannot be a foreign country for the purposes of the FTCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.280" offset="468852">Now, averring to that point, the chief point, that the sole purpose of the Federal Tort Claims Act's foreign country exception was to prevent intrusion of foreign law into domestic litigation, we believe this conclusion is amply supported by this Court's only previous opportunity to review the foreign country exception, which was in Spelar v. the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.066" offset="571983">Moreover, petitioner submits that the emphasis on the presence or absence of a foreign tort law leads to consistent results, particularly when there is ambiguity over the presence or absence of a foreign territorial sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.448" offset="649515">And thirdly, on this primary point, petitioner maintains that Congress is well aware of alternate formulations dealing with the notion foreign country, as I aver permissive, or in its mandatory forms, and therefore we can fairly interpret the foreign country exception to apply in this case to an area that is sovereignless, the one area on earth, apart from the high seas, we contend that is sovereignless.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.059" offset="771977">If this is the case and if these premises are accepted, again it is undisputed in this case that Antarctica is, in fact, a sovereignless area having no civil tort law of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.927" offset="819415">Now, in view of this, petitioner maintains that it is, in fact, the Government's position which leads to illogical and peculiar results.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.984" offset="875631">The first instance of the Government's position would be to interpret the act so that Antarctica is a foreign country, which would have the effect, the Government maintains, of barring Mrs. Smith's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.446" offset="945534">But it is clear on the record that if Mr. Smith had died because of the Government's negligence just a mile or two offshore of the McMurdo Station on the southern ocean, that that claim would cognizable under the Death on the High Seas Act, DOHSA, for the Suits in Admiralty Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.579" offset="1202057">There is no question that if this were a case between Mrs. Smith and the Government contractor, here ITT Antarctic Services, and that claim were brought in Oregon, that the law that would be applied in this case under either notions of personal sovereignty or under the conflicts restatement balancing tests, is the law of Oregon in this instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="297.917" offset="1307383">The Federal Tort Claims Act's choice of law provision refers to the place where the act or omission occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.409" offset="1325355">There is no dispute in this case that the relevant act or omission occurred in Antarctica.</text>

            <text syncTime="321.841" offset="1403095">And the choice of law direction is clear and unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.742" offset="1414694">There seems to be no dispute that under the relevant choice of law principles, the clear direction is to apply Oregon law here.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.925" offset="1487419">Well, Justice Souter, that's clearly the holding in Richards.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.837" offset="1499121">And, of course, petitioner does not dispute that holding nor does the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.847" offset="1511138">What we believe is that implicit in the choice... even though Antarctica has no choice of law rules embedded in its law, because it has no law, nonetheless the appropriate choice of law rule to advocate is the notion of personal sovereignty, which obviously has limited relevance today because there are virtually no places in the world aside from Antarctica that have no civil tort law.</text>

            <text syncTime="373.916" offset="1611343">Do you suppose they have one right now?</text>

            <label>Mr. David J. Bederman</label>
            <text syncTime="376.367" offset="1621165">--Justice O'Connor, I would imagine that despite the conditions in Somalia, no one would doubt that Somalian sovereignty, as one would understand that, is still intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.914" offset="1659409">And Somalia's civil tort law, although we might not recognize it as such, still continues in force and that it would... petitioner's submission would not be that Somalia, because of its current difficulties, ceases to be a foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.943" offset="1723461">Again, the petitioner's position is that the notion of looking for the presence or absence of a foreign tort law only comes into play when there is ambiguity over whether there is a presence of a... of a foreign territorial sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.275" offset="1796813">The Government's position would be for you to apply... to deviate from Spelar and apply a bright line test.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.929" offset="1819487">But there are dangers in that that the courts in this country have experienced, particularly a few years back with the international legal status of Okinawa after the end of World War II, where the courts struggled mightily to determine whether the United States was territorial sovereign on Okinawa, but ultimately concluded that that issue was not important, as per Spelar, because Japanese tort law was still in force.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.075" offset="1916036">Again, there isn't any concern in this case about a foreign tort law intruding.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.207" offset="1936516">And, again, if... if one recognizes that the purpose of the FTCA is to place the Government in the same position as a private tort feasor, the Government's submission would basically make Antarctica the legal equivalent of a black hole.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.609" offset="1990119">That is, people are governed by no law there.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.778" offset="1998792">And in a case brought by Sandra Jean Smith against a private contractor, that... that case would have to be nonsuited.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.884" offset="2027317">That is not a result which is countenanced in Anglo-American jurisprudence.</text>

            <text syncTime="482.285" offset="2044872">Because in a case brought against a private contractor they wouldn't be stuck with the provision of the Federal Tort Claims Act saying you necessarily have to apply the law of the place of the tort.</text>

            <text syncTime="501.280" offset="2120836">--Well, Justice Souter, I mean not to get into a discourse about whether the lex loci delecti rule is still the rule adopted in the common law of most American States, it seems to me that notions of personal sovereignty and the conflict restatement test are perfectly consistent with the choice of law direction of the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.311" offset="2200979">As this Court recognized in Richards, it is incumbent in... sort of in view of the interstitial character of the Federal Tort Claims Act and recognition of sort of even what one might call a Federalism concern in applying, in this case, Oregon wrongful... Oregon's wrongful death statute, that we can countenance a case where it proceeds on some notion of personal sovereignty or under balancing of factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.558" offset="2297946">The... the other... again, the Government's position, it seems to me, is the one that suffers from... from difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.644" offset="2342354">Because of the difficulty of reconciling the... the result if John Emmett Smith had died on the southern ocean just offshore of the McMurdo Station as opposed to having been unlucky enough to die on land, that seems to be one powerful reason to... to interpret the foreign country exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.988" offset="2423647">And consistently, we think, with its language, to include Antarctica or to conclude that Antarctica is not a foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.863" offset="2451232">Likewise, I've averred to what I regard as their peculiar position that Antarctica has no law, and necessarily following from that that in a case of a private action, that no... that no law could be applied and the case would be nonsuited.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.183" offset="2512463">In view of this, it seems to me clear that the... that the proper, the clear, the consistent interpretation of the foreign country exception would be to hold that Antarctica cannot be a foreign country.</text>

            <label>Mr. Christopher J. Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="1214.661" offset="4974348">The point I think Justice Souter well made a few minutes ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.853" offset="4999112">So even without the presumption against extraterritoriality, we would say that it's clear that Congress didn't intend to waive sovereign immunity for torts arising in Antarctica.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.442" offset="5049476">But... but that longstanding presumption resolves any doubt, in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.096" offset="5072150">In EEOC v. Aramco this Court recently reiterated that a statute does not apply overseas unless there is evidence of an affirmative congressional intent to extend its provisions beyond our territorial waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.077" offset="5135993">For the reasons I've just outlined, not only is there no affirmative intent, to the contrary, the opposite conclusion should be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.715" offset="5182596">The principle provision points to Antarctica, in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.460" offset="5201613">The venue provision would be rewritten to reinstate a result that Congress rejected, under petitioner's view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.775" offset="5234841">And, of course, rather than suggesting that the act applies overseas, Congress expressly stated that it does not apply in a foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.511" offset="5277786">I think it's useful to compare this case with EEOC v. Aramco and I'd like to take a moment to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.876" offset="5307252">In that case, of course, this Court held that title VII doesn't apply overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.081" offset="5332016">Now, title VII contained an alien exemption provision stating that title VII didn't apply to the employment of aliens outside any State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.067" offset="5367961">This Court acknowledged that by negative implication the alien exemption provision suggested that U.S. citizens might be covered overseas, but held that that was not clear enough to overcome the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.297" offset="5428878">Moreover, there was nothing in title VII that would have been rendered incoherent by a holding that it applied overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.763" offset="5470779">And in our view, section 1346(b), the provision directing courts to the law of the place where the act or omission occurred, would have no meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="1377.387" offset="5625319">I'd like to say a word about the purposes of the foreign country exception in the FTCA and the presumption against extraterritoriality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.545" offset="5657920">Petitioner essentially hangs her whole argument on the fact that one purpose of those rules is to avoid the application of foreign law, but they have other purposes as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.353" offset="5713090">By limiting FTCA claims to, quote, claims arising in this country, as Assistant Attorney General Shea said when he proposed the language of the exception, Congress solved various other problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.383" offset="5773277">For instance, in this case suppose that the accident had occurred as the hikers approached the New Zealand base and had been witnessed by persons at the base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.570" offset="5814028">Deposing those witnesses, subpoenaing them for trial in Oregon, wouldn't be simple matters, as... as the Ninth Circuit recognized in the Meredith case and as the Fourth Circuit recognized in the Burna case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.690" offset="5866481">As Assistant Attorney General Shea put it, barring such claims... or not barring such claims, rather, would, quote, lead to a great deal of difficulty, unquote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.455" offset="5905561">In addition, petitioner overlooks the general purpose of the FTCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.560" offset="5925936">It's a waiver of sovereign immunity, but it's subject to many limitations and exceptions, some of which are broad, like the discretionary function exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.795" offset="5958955">Essentially, before 1946 Congress itself handled all tort claims and Congress' broader purpose was to get rid of the cumbersome tort claim procedure, or at least to limit it sharply by waiving torts... in our view, waiving liability for torts committed in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.438" offset="6041502">But petitioner and others injured overseas, in our view, are simply in the position that all plaintiffs were before 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.274" offset="6076819">The presumption against extraterritoriality, this Court said in the Foley Brothers case, is premised on the notion that Congress... Congress' concern is assumed to be domestic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.585" offset="6138050">And, indeed, in that case which involved application of the 8-hour rule in Iraq, this Court held that the law did not apply there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.530" offset="6177861">There... there was no suggestion or discussion in the Court's opinion, on how this might conflict in any way with Iraqi law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.896" offset="6215268">Petitioner also finds it odd that she might have a claim had the accident occurred on the high seas off the Antarctic shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.215" offset="6264588">Well, in our view that just shows that Congress knows how to waive immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.188" offset="6284441">It has done it on the high seas and it hasn't done it in foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.723" offset="6306592">Line drawing problems are, of course, unavoidable unless Congress waives immunity altogether or not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.259" offset="6336790">If a diplomat driving to Ottawa gets in a traffic accident, the United States will be liable under the FTCA if the accident occurs on this side of the border, but not on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.778" offset="6386841">Petitioner has also suggested that it's unfair in some way that the United States has extended the tax and the criminal laws to Antarctica, but hasn't waived sovereign immunity for torts there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.368" offset="6453192">Again, we think this helps us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.109" offset="6464163">The tax statute specifically mentions Antarctica and the criminal law statute is phrased to make clear that it applies in all areas without a sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.956" offset="6507526">Congress knows how to cover Antarctica, it's done it in other statutes, it hasn't done it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.382" offset="6537306">In sum, petitioner is seeking this Court... asking this Court to infer an extraterritorial waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.620" offset="6586207">There is no presumption in favor of such waivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.044" offset="6603866">In fact, they're doubly... the presumptions doubly run the other way.</text>

            <label>Mr. David J. Bederman</label>
            <text syncTime="1856.476" offset="7541662">I hope just to... Chief Justice, I hope just to briefly aver to some points made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.892" offset="7571337">First and most importantly, the Government places very substantial reliance on what is known as the Foley presumption, presumptioning its extraterritorial application of Acts of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.380" offset="7621283">It's petitioner's submission, as is evident on the briefs, that the Foley presumption is not even implicated here, as this Court has consistently said that the Foley presumption comes into play when there is a risk of clash with foreign laws, and there is no possibility of such a clash in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.054" offset="7695993">And moreover, if Foley is read carefully... the Government has already alluded to the case being won regarding the application of the 8-Hour Act to Iraq, the Court in that case, Justice Reed writing, made it a point to say that where the U.S. does have authority, in other words jurisdiction based on nationality, that that presumption would not be read in relation to the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.403" offset="7813335">In Antarctica the United States does have authority by virtue of jurisdiction based on nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.335" offset="7837054">As the Government has conceded already, Congress has exercised that jurisdiction regarding taxation and in criminal matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.052" offset="7871954">Again, the Foley presumption simply is irrelevant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.464" offset="7885538">Now, likewise the Government places substantial reliance on the venue problems, and the Government makes the point that petitioner's submission would simply read back into the statute language which had been dropped out specifically by Congress, that language having to do with a categorical ban on the claims of aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.990" offset="7975712">Petitioner's submission does no such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.584" offset="7990028">Petitioner is saying that where a claimant has a domicile in the United States, venue is laid and the choice of law direction is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.148" offset="8028271">It seems to me, in fact, to be an impermissible canon of construction that would deny jurisdiction to one claimant because a different claimant would have difficulty in laying a venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.978" offset="8079680">And, indeed, in terms of canons of construction regarding venue, those canons go, in fact, to construing venue statutes and not jurisdictional statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2002.138" offset="8124297">Mr. Bederman, how do you respond to the Government's argument about 1346(b), that the United States would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred?</text>

            <text syncTime="2017.695" offset="8186468">Chief Justice, my construction of 1346(b) is that if a private party would be liable as a tort feasor in Antarctica... to Mrs. Smith, say, as plaintiff... then it follows that the Government would likewise be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.226" offset="8248640">And as the Government has conceded, Antarctica... pardon my colloquialism... is not a legal black hole, that law does apply there by virtue of these choice of law principles.</text>

            <text syncTime="2042.573" offset="8286047">Well, but the Government's argument, as I understand it, is that there is no tort law governing in... in Antarctica, and therefore without regard to the foreign nation exception, you are not brought within 1346.</text>

            <text syncTime="2120.923" offset="8599412">But that is not the law and therefore the fair reading of the entirety of 1346(b), in conjunction with the remainder of the statute including the foreign country exception, leads inevitably to a finding that Antarctica is not a foreign country and that this action can proceed.</text>
