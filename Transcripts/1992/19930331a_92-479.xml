            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="141972">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 92-479, TXO Production Corporation v. Alliance Resources Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.559" offset="184186">Mr. Phillips.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="11.855" stopTime="189.470">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="11.855" offset="189306">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.152" offset="198501">Well, the Court may begin its opinion in this case in much the same way that it began its opinion in Haslip, that is, that this case is yet another challenge to a punitive damages award.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.210" offset="234759">To be sure, this case does not involve just any old punitive damages award.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.239" offset="250850">The award here of $10 million for the tort of slander of title is beyond rational explanation by reference to any legitimate interests asserted by the State of West Virginia and is the product of a procedural scheme that bore no discernable relationship to the procedural scheme that this Court reviewed and approved in Haslip.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.811" offset="321172">Indeed, the West Virginia Supreme Court's judgment ultimately rests on a wholly arbitrary, really mean versus really stupid, classification of defendants that even the respondents do not defend in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.478" offset="367879">Accordingly, that judgment should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.868" offset="377388">TXO was an oil and gas exploration company based in Texas that opened an office in West Virginia in the early 1980's.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.692" offset="408734">In 1984, it first became interested in the Blevins tract in McDowell County, West Virginia, and sought to obtain the oil and gas development rights to that tract.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.345" offset="447291">Those rights were held by Respondent Tug Fork... or excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.889" offset="461502">The title to the oil and gas was held by Respondent Tug Fork, and the development rights were held by Respondent Alliance Resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.325" offset="487206">An agreement was reached between Alliance and TXO that granted the latter the rights to the development.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.932" offset="509672">TXO received a title opinion that indicated that there was question as to whether or not a 1958 deed had, in fact, conveyed Tug Fork's interest to a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.085" offset="550214">The question then was how to resolve that problem, and TXO obtained a quitclaim deed from the recipient of the rights in order to be in a position to ensure that if it began to drill well... drill a well on that property and, in fact, successfully uncovered oil or gas, that it would be able to take that oil and gas free of any claims by this third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.590" offset="640284">So, TXO filed its quitclaim deed, and then filed a declaratory judgment action seeking to have the respective rights of the parties resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.290" offset="675079">Respondents counterclaimed in that lawsuit for slander of title based solely on TXO's action in recording the quitclaim deed and sought both compensatory damages and the punitive award.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.005" offset="713949">The case was tried exclusively on respondents' claim of slander of title.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.737" offset="732862">Respondents did not seek compensatory relief on any other theory of the case, and they did not submit an instruction to the jury with respect to any claim other than the straight slander of title claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.483" offset="767866">The jury was instructed with respect to the punitive award that it could enter an award for three purposes: to punish the wrongdoer, to serve as an example to others not to engage in such conduct, and to provide unspecified, quote, additional compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.399" offset="831500">And then in arriving at a punitive amount, the jury should consider the nature of the wrongdoing, the extent of the harm inflicted, the intent of the defendant, the wealth of the perpetrator, as well as any mitigating factors, which were unspecified by the court.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="189.470" offset="899836">Mr. Phillips, the respondent has come back with a proposal that suggests that the evidence in this case meets all those standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.028" offset="946021">Are you going to address that argument?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="204.683" stopTime="244.590">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="204.683" offset="960650">Meets all... well, actually what they argue is that it meets the standards that the Court sort of noted in Haslip as the Green, Alabama factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.618" offset="992414">In truth, I think if you were to look at the four factors that the jury was asked to look at, it would be very difficult to reach the conclusion that the jury could have come to a $10 million verdict based on these factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.658" offset="1040584">If you consider the nature of the wrongdoing, what we are talking about here is slander of title, nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.969" offset="1069841">No physical injury was a possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.842" offset="1077260">We are talking about a pure economic tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.217" offset="1086769">The entire extent of the injury that was actually caused to the plaintiffs as a consequence of this particular economic activity was $19,000.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="244.590" stopTime="258.067">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="244.590" offset="1120310">Well, the Supreme Court of West Virginia gave the impression I thought in its opinion not that there was any physical... but that your client acted with malice in the really nasty sense of the word.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="258.067" stopTime="272.359">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="258.067" offset="1174227">The West Virginia Supreme Court certainly seemed to indicate that, although it is a little difficult to understand on this record on what basis you would reach that conclusion in light of the slander of title claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.361" offset="1215396">You will recall that in the trial of this case, there was--</text>

          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="272.359" stopTime="281.934">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="272.359" offset="1231383">Yes, but if the case comes to us, we should... I suppose we would not quarrel with that judgment of the... that there was malice.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="281.934" stopTime="298.957">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="281.934" offset="1269626">--Well, there is no basis in the jury's verdict necessarily to find malice because the jury was told that it could award punitive damages simply for reckless disregard and without malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.649" offset="1304525">So, that... it's not clear to me that as it comes to this Court, that there is necessarily a jury finding of malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.131" offset="1326468">There is an appellate finding.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="298.957" offset="1337753">Yes, but do you lose the case if we assume there's malice?</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="303.034" offset="1354054">We don't lose the case on that basis.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="305.017" offset="1361995">So--</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="305.470" offset="1363771">My basic point--</text>
            <text syncTime="306.189" offset="1366697">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="307.297" offset="1371085">We're in agreement on that, Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.672" offset="1376623">But my basic point is that as you evaluate the relationship of the $10 million award, which is really where I think you have to start the legal analysis against what is going on here, in truth there isn't all that much that is going on here.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="321.934" offset="1429704">And even if you accept that it gets you over the threshold of some punitive award, it certainly doesn't take you into the $10 million range for this kind of tort.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="328.789" stopTime="339.722">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="328.789" offset="1457081">--But certainly if you're looking for reasons why the jury might have found $10 million, it's more likely that they found malice than that they simply found reckless disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.364" offset="1495428">Wouldn't you agree with that?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="339.722" offset="1500757">I would agree with that, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.815" offset="1509221">I would also, however, conclude that if you are looking to how the jury got to a $10 million award in this case, it is quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.500" offset="1531895">The question... the jury was provided with evidence of the wealth of the defendant in the case, TXO, and was asked by counsel in closing argument to award some percentage of that wealth over as a punitive award, that that would be the fair way to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.510" offset="1591977">And that is the only numerical evidence in this record, frankly, that can you get anywhere near $10 million.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="368.430" offset="1615592">Mr. Phillips, on that point, if the State of West Virginia had had, prior to your client's conduct here, a clear rule, whether it be a rule of statute or previously announced common law, to the effect that punitive damages may be awarded by reference not merely to the verdict in the tort action, but by reference to the extent... the economic extent of the harm either intended or potentially threatened by the tort, even though not realized, would you say that there was either a procedural or a substantive due process violation in applying that rule?</text>

            <text syncTime="416.441" offset="1807644">That's how you get a basis for $10 million, if there is one, yes.</text>

            <text syncTime="419.051" offset="1818093">--Right, and their... and that is part of their quest to come up with a number of $5 to $8 million because that is the potential gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.813" offset="1841185">We would still have a problem with that because you still have an extraordinary award that is difficult to justify by reference to the underlying conduct involved here, and--</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="436.559" offset="1888205">Well, but let me start just with the general proposition, which is what I was trying to get at with my question.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.899" offset="1913492">Would there be as a general judgment... would there be a procedural or substantive due process defect in that rule?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="451.256" stopTime="523.601">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="451.256" offset="1946929">--It is hard to evaluate it in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.677" offset="1952676">I think there would be a substantive problem that could arise with that rule because in a situation like this where you have a plaintiff, defendant dealing in a particular transaction, the economic theory that tells you that you are going to deter this conduct says you look at the transaction and the actual profit, and you take away all of the actual profit and then some multiple for any instances in which engaging in this same conduct might not actually be uncovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.400" offset="2059569">If you do that, as we explained in the reply brief, you take away all possible incentive for providing... for going forward with that kind of conduct, and you should, thereby, completely deter.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.943" offset="2097708">Our position is whenever you get to the point where you have put in all that retribution permits and you put in all that deterrence will permit and you go beyond that, that then you are, in effect, punishing the innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.812" offset="2153192">So, there is a substantive problem even at that level.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.560" offset="2164163">The difficulty, obviously, is where you draw the line, and if you had a situation, like you pose, where a legislature has come in and tried to make some kind of an assessment, I suspect the court ought quite rightly to be somewhat deferential in how it evaluates whether or not you've still crossed that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.321" offset="2227170">But I think there is still an excessiveness problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1529.292" offset="6259118">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.620" offset="6272388">This case, rather like the gas in the wells in the thousand acre tract, seems to be vanishing before our very eyes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.351" offset="6307288">Mr. Phillips says in response to Justice O'Connor's, I think, very important question, what standard after all does he ask this Court to promulgate, says he knew it when he saw it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.189" offset="6358697">But he doesn't really offer a test different from that in the instructions in this case, as I'll show in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.844" offset="6381267">And I do think that perhaps TXO, which has been adjudicated guilty of a number of land frauds, has sold this Court something of a dry hole because the case was originally presented as though the relevant ratio was 526 to 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.993" offset="6449916">But I think we now see that's apples to oranges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.820" offset="6461201">That is, the numerator of that fraction came from a $10 million figure which, as I will show, was well grounded in this record in terms of expected gain, what did they hope to gain not simply by recording fraudulently a phony quitclaim deed, but by doing it as part of this particular century old pattern of land fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.702" offset="6540718">The numerator was then upped somewhat in light of the fact that there is a real chance that someone will get away undetected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.527" offset="6580006">In this case, they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.370" offset="6587425">They were caught.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.964" offset="6589828">The denominator, the $19,000... that's where this fancy 526 to 1 ratio comes from... had nothing to do with what they expected to gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.037" offset="6622116">It just happened to be how much it cost to get attorneys to stand up to TXO and to stop them dead in their tracks in this declaratory judgment action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1794.358" offset="7319376">But as I understand the way you have calculated the $8.3 million that you want us to focus upon at the high end, it assumes 25 wells, all of which are successful, 0 failure rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.335" offset="7383219">It assumes that there's maximum recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.600" offset="7396281">It gives no discount for present value of money, which is routine in, say, wage earner cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1830.281" offset="7463050">Justice Kennedy, with respect to the discount rate, we were projecting figures using the $3 that was the price in 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.276" offset="7507040">TXO's own experts in defense exhibit 14 indicated that they expected the price of gas, over the 20-year life of the wells, to go up by a factor of 4 or 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.288" offset="7555105">That would more than offset any rational discount rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.443" offset="7567644">The most important point, however, isn't that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.442" offset="7579660">It is that the time to litigate the amount of expected gain is surely not in this Court reviewing this case under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.656" offset="7616545">That is, we did introduce before the jury dollar figures and a range of estimates about the number of wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.403" offset="7643503">Even if you take the lower estimate of 15 wells, you come up not with $8.3 million, but $5 million as to what they hoped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.839" offset="7677254">And it would only take a multiplier of 2 then to get punitive damages of $10 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.758" offset="7692927">But the time to contest those numbers was at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.397" offset="7707556">You see, if it were true that no one was thinking about expected gain in the State of West Virginia in a case of this kind, so that they were basically bamboozled... they didn't know that that was the focus... that might be, though not necessarily for constitutional purposes, enough of an explanation for why they didn't do it at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.515" offset="7783938">But at trial, when we introduced these numbers, we didn't get any counter-figures from TXO.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.480" offset="7815807">On the contrary, when they put on Ken Walty and Mike Good as key witnesses, it was on cross-examination of those witnesses at pages 544 to 553 and 672 to 677 of the transcript that we clearly established that they expected a multi-million dollar income stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.458" offset="7891771">Their whole strategy was don't think about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.595" offset="7904310">We're innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.376" offset="7907445">We relied on advice of counsel, arguments that have been demolished below and rejected by this jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.765" offset="7932940">When I get to the jury instructions, I think that will be clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.951" offset="7941717">They also ended up saying, as they said here, don't punish the innocent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1957.668" offset="7972542">But, of course, the theory of deterrence in West Virginia and a number of other States is that you punish in accord with what they hoped and intended to gain, not what they happened to gain.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="2172.049" offset="8830090">Justice Kennedy, I had thought that the relevant standard in substantive due process attack on a judgment such as this is whether there is any rational basis that can be offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.778" offset="8873035">In Nordlinger v. Hahn, it was stressed that what matters is not how the State's decision makers articulate that, but whether one can find a rational basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.775" offset="8913054">More recently than Nordlinger, in Growe v. Emison this Court said that one defers to judicial, as well as legislative decision making.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.865" offset="8945342">It was for that reason that we felt free and that I would fully defend taking the numbers that were before this jury, and which TXO did not undertake to attack at trial, to show how very easily from them one could understand the conclusion of the West Virginia Supreme Court that a judgment of this magnitude was needed to deter this kind of harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.589" offset="9040323">And, indeed, the instruction... to go to the questions that were asked with respect to the instructions by the Chief Justice and Justice White, if you look not just at 6A, Justice O'Connor, but if you also look at plaintiffs' instruction 2 on page 26 of the joint appendix, look at what this jury had to find in order to find TXO liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.302" offset="9115138">They had to find... second paragraph of instruction 2... TXO filed the quitclaim deed with the intent to hurt the interests of the defendants, in other words, ill will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.734" offset="9160904">They also had to find that TXO acted maliciously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.435" offset="9179712">They had to find malice and without good faith and recorded the quitclaim deed with an intent to hurt the defendants rather than clear up the title.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.024" offset="9218060">So that when, on that basis, the jury returned this award, it's not so surprising to me, given that the case was litigated below on this very theory, that that was the closing argument, that that was the brief in the State Supreme Court, that that was what the instructions called the jury's attention to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.269" offset="9282948">What did they intend to get away with, not how much did it cost to catch them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.798" offset="9297159">Given all of that, it's not so surprising that the West Virginia Supreme Court, finding this attempted fraud... and I now quote from that court... no isolated incident, but part of TXO's pattern and practice to defraud and coerce those in positions of unequal bargaining power, a pattern that the court said threatened, quote, millions of dollars in damages to other victims, unquote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.913" offset="9393603">That's not just other victims in Oklahoma or Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.365" offset="9407396">The millions of dollars in damage from numbers they didn't undertake to refute at trial would have been to us because those are royalties that we would have expected to gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.877" offset="9445430">It's no surprise that the West Virginia Supreme Court found on that basis that, quote, an award of this magnitude is necessary to discourage TXO from continuing this pattern and practice of fraud, trickery, and deceit, unquote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.886" offset="9509482">Now, if the theory is constitutional... and I see no conceivable basis as a matter of substantive due process for saying the State cannot use this as a way of deciding how much is needed to deter and punish, no basis for saying that you can't look at how much they hoped to gain, even optimistically that you can't look at that, but must instead look at some multiple of what it costs to prevent them from succeeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.032" offset="9622018">Given that there's no basis in substantive due process for that, it seems to me that all they're left with is the idea that somehow there wasn't sufficient evidence here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.481" offset="9659843">And I agree that the evidence that was in the record wasn't added up in precisely the way our brief does, but surely, that is a burden that would have fallen on TXO at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.960" offset="9701743">And it's not a proper question for this Court to second guess the reasonableness of the West Virginia judiciary in saying that $10 million was needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.519" offset="9736016">It seems to me that all they're left with is some theoretical arguments that one might debate, arguments about what's the best way to deter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.000" offset="9773946">Do you go after people, whether they succeed or fail, as West Virginia does?</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.263" offset="9794948">In fact, in its constitution, article 3, section 5, it says that the penalty should be proportionate to the nature of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.636" offset="9824414">In fact, with respect to aggravated... attempted aggravated robbery, West Virginia says we'll punish you the same way whether you succeed or fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.882" offset="9857433">Is that the best way, or is it best to only add a very high kicker when the wrongdoer succeeds?</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.894" offset="9893482">Well, that's an interesting question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.127" offset="9902468">Most States, the 27 amici who have filed a brief in support of our position, take the view that it's for them to decide and that they think it is more just, as well as more effective, to use this theory and to use a theory which, by the way, West Virginia has officially endorsed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.684" offset="9960669">The West Virginia Attorney General, at pages 6 to 7 of the amicus brief filed by the 27 States, endorses this very theory quoting from the Garnes case, and Garnes really expresses the view that the reason it is improper to play with numbers and look at these proportions is precisely that it's perverse in terms of incentives and in terms of fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.611" offset="10060352">What it means is that when a victim is smart enough and tough enough to stand up to an extortionate scheme, as the respondents did here, then the wrongdoer is going to be, in effect, rewarded, rewarded because the most that can be charged against it is the attorney's fees or some reasonably low multiple thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.164" offset="10158573">Because the West Virginia Supreme Court has quite clearly rejected that approach and has said instead you look to the expected gain, it seems to me that all that's left is some possible procedural due process arguments, and perhaps I should turn to those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.562" offset="10232134">I don't think, by the way, that the Court ought to reach the merits of some of the fancier procedural due process arguments that we have here because TXO's only argument at trial was about the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.619" offset="10300365">They said that slander of title violates the First Amendment, but nowhere at trial did they argue that under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, one is entitled to some different or more precise jury instructions or some further kind of explanation by a trial judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2563.780" offset="10397019">They also said that their new rules, which are rather like what I gather TXO would like this Court to promulgate somehow for all 50 States... their new rules about jury instructions and post-verdict explanation in the Garnes case should not be applied retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.805" offset="10457100">The West Virginia Supreme Court ruled that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.914" offset="10465564">But it was never asked to rule that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires of its own force special instructions beyond those that were used in Haslip.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.910" offset="10509554">It was never asked to rule for the first time that Fourteenth Amendment due process requires States to assign some special role to the trial judge post-verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.796" offset="10549156">And when we made that argument, the response of TXO at footnote 33 of their brief was that it's frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.137" offset="10578517">It's frivolous to say they waived it, and to prove that, they give you a 23-word snippet from their brief below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.385" offset="10603490">I would invite you to look at the relevant parts of that brief when there is time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.758" offset="10624911">In their reply in support of certiorari in their appendix, they reproduced the entire relevant portion of their brief below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.974" offset="10653854">I think a fair reading of that whole argument is simply West Virginia law under Garnes should entitle us retroactively to these special procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.344" offset="10695337">If the Court, however, were to reach the merits of the procedural attack, I think it's quite clear that TXO ought to lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.137" offset="10726475">The State Supreme Court's post-verdict review, which was critical in Haslip, was at least as thorough here as in the Alabama Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.181" offset="10762628">Now, the petitioners make some mileage out of Justice Neely's rhetoric; that is, they make something of the fact that he used some homespun shorthand to categorize wrongdoers as really mean or really stupid, but I think that's a pretty irrelevant distraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.157" offset="10838592">His colleagues called him to task for what they thought was unduly colorful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.592" offset="10856251">In any event, he explained in good old-fashioned legalese, very traditional, exactly what those terms meant, and lo and behold, they meant exactly what we would expect, intentional, malicious, deliberate wrongdoing was the kind that really mean was supposed to cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.040" offset="10918109">So, one can't make a federal case out of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.023" offset="10933992">As far as the trial judge's review post-verdict, they make the rather astonishing argument now... they didn't make it below, but they make the argument now, supported by at least some of their amici, that the Federal Constitution guarantees them a right to, quote, several layers, unquote, of judicial review... that's at footnote 38 of their reply... and, therefore, to a fuller post-verdict explanation by the trial judge than they got here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.840" offset="11041303">I would submit that that's untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.277" offset="11051020">Even in criminal cases, this Court has held ever since McCain v. Durston, that the Fourteenth Amendment entitles you to only one level of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.679" offset="11084666">It's entirely up to the States how to allocate post-verdict assessments as between their trial and appellate judiciaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.848" offset="11117267">And, anyway, TXO could have received, had they only asked, a much fuller explanation from the trial judge of just why he thought $10 million was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.719" offset="11156764">And that does go back to the questions that both you, Justice O'Connor, and you, Justice Kennedy, asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.451" offset="11175676">That is, if one is nervous about the attempt in hindsight to figure out just exactly where the $10 million could have come from, it seems to me that the fault for that difficulty should be placed squarely at the feet of TXO.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.508" offset="11235967">They had, after all, a bifurcated trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.272" offset="11251014">Under West Virginia Rule of Civil Procedure 42(c), they could have had a trifurcated trial with a separate proceeding on punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.129" offset="11278390">West Virginia would have fully entitled them to put special interrogatories to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.971" offset="11297825">If they wanted to know exactly how these numbers were derived, they could have asked, but it was too obvious to anyone I think for them to make quite a fuss about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.029" offset="11330008">Their whole strategy was, and it seems here to be, simply to emphasize, look, we may have done terrible things, but that was in other States, and here we were innocent, although the jury evidently found that they were guilty of the most scurrilous, deliberate, fraudulent behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.430" offset="11387686">As far as the jury's role is concerned, not only were the instructions given in this case considerably more constraining than those that the Court found sufficient in the Haslip case, not only did they require a showing of indifference to the rights of others, something very much like the utter disregard phrase that the Court thought sufficient when given a further gloss in your opinion yesterday in Creech, Justice O'Connor, not only that, but they didn't ask for any further instructions, as we show in some detail in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.336" offset="11543272">Beyond that they waived any requests for including proportionality in the instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.818" offset="11573156">We explained that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.410" offset="11575559">They were satisfied to have the jury have even less guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.504" offset="11587889">As a matter of strategy, their whole game was we're innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.018" offset="11605965">They didn't want to focus the jury on punitive, and so, they can surely not complain now even if the Court were to reach that issue on the merits of a violation of procedural due process in terms of the jury's role.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.481" offset="11651836">Well, there being no violation of procedural due process, and it being quite clear that the judgment below meets the standard for substantive due process, it really does seem to me that this case is not an opportunity for the Court to give further guidance to the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.271" offset="11719023">And let me just add a word about that issue of further guidance because one of the recurring themes in the petitioner's submissions is somehow to recur to passion and prejudice, prejudice against out-of-staters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.439" offset="11775657">Well, that's a red herring here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.015" offset="11782031">TXO and Alliance are both Texas corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.968" offset="11793838">There's not a scintilla of evidence about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.090" offset="11802302">Passion and prejudice, but no real standards, nothing that would really offer guidance to the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.823" offset="11829260">And I think I know why.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.995" offset="11833858">Because that's a fundamentally legislative task.</text>

            <text syncTime="3147.373" offset="12731425">First of all, you will notice that again, there is no defense of the punitive award on the terms that it was imposed by the jury and upheld by the West Virginia Supreme Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.509" offset="12779908">Indeed, I think Mr. Tribe revealed quite plainly that he cannot defend it on that ground, that he has to find some other ground by which to justify this award and then invokes Nordlinger v. Hahn to justify it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3175.172" offset="12842602">If... your procedural due process argument would, indeed, say, well, it has to be upheld on the same ground that was proposed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3209.675" offset="12980633">I'm not... I am not here to defend across the board the possibility that $10 million verdicts can never be entered in any kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.234" offset="13014906">What I am here to say is that the $10 million verdict in this case is grossly excessive, and if this Court has meant what it said in the past, that grossly... that a State is no more permitted to assess a grossly excessive damage award than it is to impose a grossly excessive fine, this is the case that tests the limits of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.007" offset="13089930">And if you go back and examine with care the precise items that Mr. Tribe has gone through and look at the jury instructions, if they thought they had tried this case on a potential gain theory throughout the entire proceedings, wouldn't it have been reasonable to expect that when they proposed a jury instruction that it would have said you must measure this by the potential gain rather than by the harm actually inflicted?</text>
