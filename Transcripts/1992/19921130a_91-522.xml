            <text syncTime="17.473" offset="215971">The question before the Court in this case is whether United States courts have jurisdiction to review respondent's allegations that while working for a government-owned hospital in Saudi Arabia, he was wrongfully arrested, imprisoned and tortured by agents of the Government of Saudi Arabia.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.934" offset="281904">The answer to this question must be no.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.983" offset="290054">Nevertheless, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in this case held that clause 1 in the commercial activity exception in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act conferred jurisdiction over respondent's claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="66.775" offset="413248">Nevertheless, reversal of the court of appeals on either ground requires dismissal of the complaint in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.921" offset="441774">The court of appeals held that a cause of action is based upon commercial activity when the acts complained of bear a jurisdictional nexus to that activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1073.270" offset="4439240">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.375" offset="4519592">The court of appeals has interpreted the commercial activity exception in a way that would dramatically curtail the sovereign immunity of not just Saudi Arabia, but the entire community of nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.102" offset="4562538">We urge this Court to correct that error, an error that could prompt other nations to limit the United States' sovereign immunity in their courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.856" offset="4593571">Under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, Saudi Arabia is immune from the respondents' claims unless those claims are based upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.923" offset="4641845">The court of appeals mistakenly concluded that the based upon requirement was satisfied here because according to the complaint, Saudi Arabia recruited Mr. Nelson in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.331" offset="4683432">He was mistreated abroad, and his mistreatment was causally related to his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.437" offset="4707883">The problem with the court's reasoning is that Congress did not use that court's so-called nexus test in formulating the commercial activity exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.442" offset="4739857">Congress said the suit must be based upon a commercial activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.165" offset="4758770">In other words, the commercial activity must be the basis of foundation for the legal claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.227" offset="4779041">In common law parlance, the complaint... or the commercial activity must provide the gist or gravamen of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.771" offset="4805163">Although recruitment activities can, in theory, qualify as a commercial activity, the Saudi recruitment activities alleged here do not provide a basis for the respondents' claims of intentional injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.239" offset="4847063">The respondents do not contend that Scott Nelson was injured during the recruitment process in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.944" offset="4869947">Rather, they contend that the harm alleged here occurred 10 months later during his employment in Saudi Arabia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.088" offset="4902443">The respondents' intentional injury claims are explicitly based on the Saudis' noncommercial acts of arresting and jailing Mr. Nelson in that country.</text>

            <text syncTime="1344.881" offset="5525620">I misunderstood your question, and my answer there is that would not be a commercial activity in that situation, that is a tort that occurs overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.227" offset="5554982">Now, in this case the alleged recruitment activities in this country simply have no legal or factual bearing on respondents' right to relief and we think that's critical to the inquiry in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.916" offset="5605764">Now, the court of appeals decision is clearly contrary to the specific language of the commercial activity exception, and perhaps for that reason, respondents have changed their legal theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1399.351" offset="5743481">As this Court indicated in Weltover, the focus must be on the particular commercial conduct, transaction, or act that provides the basis for the claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1572.260" offset="6435204">The difficulty here is the result might seem harsh in this individual case, but it accords with the reasonable and reciprocal expectations of sovereign nations with respect to the exercise of their police powers within their own borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.642" offset="6496644">For example, the United States would vigorously object to being sued in a Saudi court by a Saudi citizen seeking damages based on his arrest in this country regardless of the reason for his arrest or his treatment while in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.068" offset="6550352">Sovereign nations have always been immune from these types of lawsuits, and nothing in the commercial activity exception alters that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.254" offset="6579086">Our view is, in this case, that even if you could characterize the arresting and jailing of Mr. Nelson as commercial practices, those practices do not have substantial contact with the United States in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.063" offset="6634361">Not only do the alleged Saudi practices regulate employee conduct taking place wholly in a Saudi-owned work place in Saudi Arabia, but Mr. Nelson's employment contract specifically stated... and as I alluded to before, and I quote now... in the case of any dispute arising from this contract, the Saudi courts, authorities, or commissions only will have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.326" offset="6715445">Thus, the contract that Mr. Nelson signed clearly envisioned that any... that U.S. courts would not have jurisdiction to hear any dispute arising from his employment relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="1714.994" offset="7006136">This is a case about jurisdiction over a hospital, not a police department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.698" offset="7028915">The question presented is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.588" offset="7036438">May a hospital owned by a foreign government come to the United States for its work force, recruit and hire a United States citizen to perform a specific job overseas, beat and torture him for the proper performance of his responsibilities, and then claim immunity for its actions in the U.S. courts?</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.727" offset="7129016">We say it cannot.</text>

            <text syncTime="1754.850" offset="7165483">First, there are, as the Court knows, three separate defendants in this case, and there are, in effect, three separate complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.018" offset="7206234">Where this hospital is concerned, petitioner's motion to dismiss the facial challenge that they have mounted to subject matter jurisdiction requires that a court focus on the factual allegations in the complaint concerning the conduct of the hospital.</text>

            <text syncTime="1806.194" offset="7370910">The United States, as amicus, has said that at least one of those, the negligence count, should survive the jurisdictional test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.590" offset="7400481">We believe that Saudi Arabia can be answerable as an alter ego of the hospital, as its principal, as the person exercising control over all aspects of its operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.725" offset="7441023">But there are, in the complaint in counts III through VII, alternative theories of liability that are stated against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, international law theories that, frankly in our view, cannot withstand analysis following the Court's decision in the Amerada Hess case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.497" offset="7512076">This complaint was filed prior to that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.310" offset="7527331">What we are advancing in this argument today is the core proposition of jurisdiction over the hospital and the subsidiary proposition that there is jurisdiction over Saudi Arabia as its owner and Royspec as its agent in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2134.179" offset="8682884">But the most fundamental conduct here, Justice O'Connor, is that the petitioners came to the United States to ask Mr. Nelson to do a specific job for them, induced him through a rather extensive course of dealing to come to Saudi Arabia to do that job, and once he was there, beat and tortured him precisely for doing that job that they had recruited and hired him to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="2908.436" offset="11779857">He reported them to hospital officials, as his job required him to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="3553.685" offset="14360859">It has to do with the nature of what this hospital does in Saudi Arabia, and it's our view that the hospital had no contact at all with the United States.</text>
