            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text>We'll hear argument next in No. 91-321, Itel Containers International Corporation v. Joe Huddleston.</text>
            <text>Mr. Collier, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_w_collier">
            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>The issue in this case is whether Tennessee's sales tax imposed on Itel's Federally bonded containers dedicated exclusively to use in foreign commerce is prohibited by the 1956 and 1972 treaties on containers, as well as the body of Federal implementing regulation, and the foreign commerce and import-export clauses of the Constitution.</text>
            <text>At the time Tennessee imposed its tax, Itel was one of the largest container leasing companies in the world.</text>
            <text>Itel delivered its containers at 98 locations across the United States and an additional 129 locations around the globe; but only one government in the world imposed a tax on Itel's containers, Tennessee.</text>
            <text>As the United Kingdom and other nations have noted, none of the 59 nations which have signed the two container treaties impose any form of sales or use taxation on containers.</text>
            <text>But it is not the language here of Tennessee's taxing statute which is unique.</text>
            <text>Instead, it is the application of that statute to tax container leases.</text>
            <text>Indeed, 44 of Tennessee's sister States and many of the signatory nations to the container treaties impose some form of sales or use taxation on lease transactions.</text>
            <text>But it not mere coincidence that no other government in the world imposes sales or use tax equivalents on containers.</text>
            <text>The reason that Tennessee acts alone here is that the imposition of its tax is prohibited by the container treaties, runs counter to the custom of nations, and is at odds with this Court's logic in the Japan Line decision.</text>
            <text>There are three related, but independent grounds for reversal here.</text>
            <text>Each ground shares in common the special transitory nature of Federally bonded containers dedicated exclusively to use in foreign commerce.</text>
            <text>First, both the terms and the policies of the container treaties and the implementing Federal regulation prohibit the tax, and the application of the tax by Tennessee offends the principles of the foreign commerce clause by creating a substantial and genuine threat of foreign retaliation and because of the risk of multiple taxation.</text>
            <text>Finally, Tennessee's tax is a prohibited tax on goods in transit under the logic of the import-export clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text>Now, the issue of whether the terms of the container treaties prohibit Tennessee's tax presents a direct confrontation between the United States and 14 nations, including three of the United States' largest five trading partners, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom.</text>
            <text>The United Kingdom, a primary drafter of the 1956 treaty, and the other protesting nations concur with Itel's reading of the express terms of the convention that Tennessee's tax is prohibited because it is imposed in connection with or by reason of the containers' importation.</text>
            <text>These protesting nations point out that they have withheld the application of their taxes in reliance upon these treaties' obligations.</text>
            <text>Now, the position taken by the United States today, that the treaties prohibit only the imposition of customs duties and not State taxes, is at odds and is a complete reversal of its position taken in 1978 before this Court in Japan Line.</text>
            <text>So, certainly the reading given today of the treaties' language must be viewed and consider... must be viewed and considered in light of that interpretation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>How do you interpret this tax to be imposed to be chargeable by reason of importation?</text>
            <text>That's the language of the conventions that we're dealing with.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_w_collier">
            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>Yes, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text>The concept of importation, as described in the convention, not only connotes a temporal event, such as the crossing of a border, but indeed, the status of the containers as they remain within the borders of a signatory nation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>You cannot tax anything that has been imported?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_w_collier">
            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>You cannot tax a container once it has been temporarily imported and remains subject to the protection of the treaties.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>It doesn't say by reason of temporary importation.</text>
            <text>It says by reason of importation, chargeable by reason of importation.</text>
            <text>Now, there are two ways to read it, it seems to me.</text>
            <text>One is, the tax is upon the act of importing.</text>
            <text>It is upon the importing.</text>
            <text>And the other way to read it is it... importing is a but-for cause of the tax.</text>
            <text>You wouldn't have been hit with the tax if you hadn't imported.</text>
            <text>But if you read it the latter way, my goodness, all imported goods are free from property taxes, sales taxes, all sorts of taxes.</text>
            <text>You can't read it that way, can you?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_w_collier">
            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>First of all, I would agree with you, Justice Scalia, that there are two readings which might be given to this tax.</text>
            <text>You've identified each of them, but both meanings are incorporated into the treaty provisions.</text>
            <text>First, the treaty does not prohibit the imposition of all taxes on imported goods, but addresses containers which are crossing borders and moving into the interior of a nation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Where does it address those?</text>
            <text>Does it mention them?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_w_collier">
            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>Yes.</text>
            <text>The 1956 treaty tax prohibition covers... and I quote... not only customs duties, but also all duties and taxes whatsoever chargeable by reason of importation.</text>
            <text>And the definition of temporary admission given in the 1956 treaty applies to containers and the importation of those containers into the interior pass... crossing the border of a nation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, that just proves that they're imported.</text>
            <text>A lot of other things are imported as well.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_w_collier">
            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>A number of other things are imported, but the treaties on containers cover taxes on containers, not merely the goods imported in containers.</text>
            <text>And so, the treaties' application is limited to those containers and a tax on those containers.</text>
            <text>The definition of temporary admission, set forth in article 1(b) of the treaty of '72, describes temporary admission to mean temporary importation subject to reexportation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Is a general property tax permissible if the container happens to be there on the lien date?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_w_collier">
            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>If the tax is imposed by reason of importation--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, I'm... that's what I'm trying to test.</text>
            <text>Suppose the State says that all personal property here on March the 15th shall be taxed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_w_collier">
            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>--Yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And the container is assessed a tax.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_w_collier">
            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>Yes, Justice Kennedy, I do believe that under the treaties a property tax based upon presence would be by reason of importation to that jurisdiction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And that's because the container couldn't have been there but for the importation and, therefore, this tax must be by reason of importation.</text>
            <text>Is that your train of logic?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_w_collier">
            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>Yes, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text>I think that's a fair summary.</text>
            <text>And, indeed, the United States in 1978 in its brief pointed out to this Court that containers which have crossed the international border and entered the domestic commerce of a nation are considered to be absent.</text>
            <text>They're not subject to State taxation once they're in the interior of a nation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, the Government is certainly taking a different position today, and it's saying that the convention means that Tennessee's tax is collected in connection with and chargeable by reason of sales, not by reason of importation.</text>
            <text>Now, do we owe any deference to the Government's interpretation of this treaty?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_w_collier">
            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>I think it has been recognized many times by this Court that the interpretation of an international treaty by the executive branch is due deference.</text>
            <text>My only point, Justice O'Connor, is simply that they have expressed one interpretation in 1978 and the other at this time, and I would point out that this Court ruled in Nielsen v. Johnson that where a treaty fairly admits two interpretations, the one restricting and the other enlarging rights provided for in that treaty, then the liberal interpretation is to be preferred.</text>
            <text>And certainly the United States cannot disagree that the interpretation placed on this treaty by eight of the original 12 drafters and in harmony with its interpretation in 1978 is unreasonable.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Collier, let me try to put my earlier question more precisely.</text>
            <text>What kind of a tax upon these containers would not be a tax chargeable by reason of importation?</text>
            <text>I mean, I am pressed with the fact that these treaties do not say containers may not be taxed.</text>
            <text>It doesn't say that.</text>
            <text>It says that there may not be imposed upon them any taxes chargeable by reason of importation.</text>
            <text>Now, why that narrowing?</text>
            <text>What has been excluded by saying only those taxes chargeable by reason of importation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_w_collier">
            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>The 1972 treaty clarified that issue when it provided a limited exception to the type of taxes that could be imposed on containers, and that exception is set forth in article 1(a) of the container treaty of 1972 where the treaty excluded fees and charges limited in amount to the approximate cost of services rendered.</text>
            <text>Now, I might point out that an exception which is provided to a prohibition of taxes in a treaty need not have been provided unless that was prohibited by the general prohibition in the first place.</text>
            <text>So, there is an exception.</text>
            <text>If Tennessee, for instance, operates a container terminal where it provides a crane and services to a container, it may then tax or charge a fee on the containers in that setting.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>What... so, you say... and it meant that even before that provision was added in the later treaty?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_w_collier">
            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>It did.</text>
            <text>In fact, there is legislative history to the 1956 convention which discusses the permissibility of user fees of this kind.</text>
            <text>So, the--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Isn't the Tennessee tax... what do they call it?</text>
            <text>A use tax or--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_w_collier">
            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>--A sales tax.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>--a sales tax?</text>
            <text>Well, don't they measure it by the number of days in Tennessee and the cost of services rendered?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_w_collier">
            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>They do not.</text>
            <text>Tennessee's tax bears no relationship to the length of the lease, the number of days that the container is on lease.</text>
            <text>It is based simply on the transfer of possession within the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text>Indeed, Itel's leases, as is noted in the record, are 6 months or more.</text>
            <text>They're per diem leases, and these containers during the lease term are in Tennessee for only a fraction, a very small fraction, of the lease term.</text>
            <text>So it is not charged on that basis.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But are they not in Tennessee at the time of the transaction?</text>

          <turn speaker="philip_w_collier">
            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>It is true that the containers are present and have been imported into Tennessee at the time of the tax.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>How is this different from a case in which, say, the containers were manufactured in Tennessee, and then sold to the person who was going to use them?</text>
            <text>Could you then put a sales tax on it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">

            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>

            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>--In that situation, Justice Stevens, I would say that the treaty does prohibit the imposition of such a tax.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>And in this case, we--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>How could the language of the treaty possibly cover the sales tax?</text>
            <text>Because it isn't there by reason of importation.</text>
            <text>It's there by reason of having been manufactured there and sold.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_w_collier">
            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>--I think that's a good point, Justice Stevens, and I suppose I simply haven't considered it well enough.</text>
            <text>Indeed, in this case, all of Itel's containers... and it's stipulated... were all manufactured abroad and brought in as instruments of international traffic.</text>
            <text>So, that situation would not obtain in this situation.</text>
            <text>In any event, putting aside for a moment the precise language and terms of the container treaties, this Court has consistently invalidated the imposition of State taxes on goods dedicated to use in foreign commerce where the imposition of that State tax removes the benefit from the imposition from the waiver of Federal customs duties.</text>
            <text>In Xerox Corporation v. Harris County, Texas, and McGoldrick v. Gulf Oil Corporation, the Court considered the preemptive effect of Federal statutes which merely excepted goods from customs duty.</text>
            <text>In the first case, it was copiers transshipped to Houston, Texas.</text>
            <text>In the second case, it was fuel oil which had been refined after importation from Venezuela and was on its way out to be sold to ship stores in New York Harbor.</text>
            <text>In each case, despite the fact the congressional statute did not address the imposition of State taxes, this Court invalidated the State tax because it posed the same obstacle that was posed by the imposition of a customs duty.</text>
            <text>In McGoldrick, it was the New York City sales tax on fuel oil to be exported as ship stores in vessels that were laid in New York Harbor, and in the Xerox case, it was copiers, which were manufactured in Mexico, were brought into Houston, and were intended to be sold outside of the Nation.</text>
            <text>This case is essentially a replica of that situation.</text>
            <text>First, the objectives of the container treaties are three-fold.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="philip_w_collier">
            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>I'm sorry.</text>
            <text>In Japan Line or in--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>In the two cases you've just described.</text>
            <text>Did the United States favor the State taxes or disfavor them?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_w_collier">
            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>--I simply don't know the answer to that.</text>
            <text>In the situation in our case, the United States reasoned that McGoldrick did apply to containers under the treaty and under the Federal regulation, and indeed, the United States in Japan Line pointed out to this Court that not only the treaties, but the implementing Federal regulation created a circumstance where the containers were simply not present for purposes of State taxation, and that the tax on containers should be invalidated under the reasoning of McGoldrick.</text>
            <text>There are three objectives to the treaties here.</text>
            <text>The first is the overarching objective of the treaties to encourage the selection of containers for carrying goods in foreign commerce.</text>
            <text>The reason behind the treaty was that this would simply reduce the unit transport cost of goods as they travel in an increasing international market.</text>
            <text>Now, there were two other purposes, though, to this treaty adopted and articulated by the United States.</text>
            <text>First, President Johnson in 1966, in recommending the adoption of the 1956 treaty, noted that the purpose of the conventions were to aid the American export drive by reducing the cost of carrying American goods by container to foreign markets.</text>
            <text>And finally, the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, in recommending the adoption of the 1972 treaty, pointed out that the purpose of the treaty was to benefit United States owned and operated containers.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Do all of those things if it eliminates them from customs duties and import taxes, but it's... it does benefit them that way.</text>
            <text>And that's an additional tax that these containers would constantly and repetitively be subjected to.</text>
            <text>It achieves that objective, but it doesn't have to in addition eliminate sales taxes on leases, which are not repetitive and which all property is subject to whether it's property that's constantly used in commerce or not.</text>
            <text>It seems quite reasonable to me.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_w_collier">
            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>Certainly the same arguments were made in both McGoldrick and Xerox, and in McGoldrick, in particular, the tax imposed was a sales tax.</text>
            <text>It was a sales tax on fuel oil sold to ship stores which could have been taxed in other jurisdictions under consumption taxes.</text>
            <text>In addition, in this particular situation, both McGoldrick and Xerox pointed out that, of course, the State sales tax and the State property tax were not customs duties, but nevertheless, the same objectives are stricken by the tax.</text>
            <text>First, there really is little difference in the impact of a State sales tax on container leases from a customs duty on the goods moving across the borders.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text>I mean, we're talking about a text here, chargeable by reason of importation.</text>

          <turn speaker="philip_w_collier">
            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>Well, we're not only talking about the treaties.</text>
            <text>We're talking about the implementing Federal regulation which excepts them from customs duties and the amendment to 19 U.S.C. 1202, the harmonized tariff schedules of the United States.</text>
            <text>So, we're talking about not only the language of two treaties, but the Federal implementing regulation.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, if you're talking about a Federal regulation, surely there you also give deference to the executive branch in construing the regulation, do you not?</text>

          <turn speaker="philip_w_collier">
            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>I think the same deference is applied to the interpretation of a regulation, as long as that regulation is not at odds with the delegated power from Congress.</text>
            <text>And again, I would point out that the opposite position was taken by the United States in 1978.</text>

            <text>All these containers are manufactured abroad, and they're shipped to different places in the United States, including Tennessee.</text>

            <text>What Congress sought through the waiver of customs duties in this case was to allow the free movement of containers without reducing their cost, either due to the crossing of a border or the imposition of tax, and certainly in this case, Congress has waived the benefit of quite a bit of customs duties: $178,000 approximately in this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles W. Burson</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>Petitioner raises three challenges to Tennessee's sales tax as applied to leases of intermodal containers delivered to lessees in the State.</text>
            <text>The tax is preempted by the terms of the 1956 and 1972 customs conventions.</text>
            <text>The tax impermissibly impinges upon the foreign commerce clause, and the tax frustrates the purposes of the export-import clause.</text>
            <text>It's the State's contention that the following two propositions dispose of these arguments.</text>
            <text>One, the tax is a generally applicable, nondiscriminatory sales tax.</text>
            <text>It's, thus, beyond the scope of the customs conventions' prescriptions of duties and taxes imposed by reason of or in connection with importation.</text>
            <text>Two, the tax as applied isn't at variance with any doctrine or principle of international taxation accepted by the United States.</text>
            <text>This principle disposes of foreign commerce concerns, for if the tax doesn't conflict with international principles recognized by the United States, there can be no State interference with the Federal Government's regulation of foreign commerce.</text>
            <text>The two principles together establish that the tax doesn't frustrate the purposes of the export-import clause, as articulated in Michelin.</text>
            <text>The tax at issue is not a duty imposed by reason of or in connection with importation.</text>
            <text>It's a garden variety sales tax.</text>
            <text>It's a source of general revenue for Tennessee.</text>
            <text>As virtually all generally applicable sales taxes, it applies to the sale of goods and to leases of personal property wherein delivery occurs within the State.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Suppose we were to find as a definitive matter that no country in Europe under its interpretation of the treaty could levy the tax that was being levied here, that this was their interpretation.</text>
            <text>It's not our interpretation, but it's theirs... and that were definitive.</text>
            <text>I know that's in dispute.</text>

            <text>What we say is essential is what this Nation recognizes.</text>
            <text>That's the voice with which... the voices with which the United States speak as the principles that we have to be in compliance with.</text>
            <text>The foreign commerce clause doesn't tell Tennessee it has to comply with the dictates of foreign nations and their practices.</text>
            <text>What it tells us is we have to comply with and be uniform with expression of our national policies in regard to international trade.</text>

            <text>Well, suppose we were to find that a ruling in your favor would cause the levies of multiple taxes in other countries, particularly Europe, and that this would be burdensome on foreign commerce.</text>

            <text>Well, but that's quite liable to happen.</text>
            <text>If we rule in your favor... and that's a definitive interpretation of the treaty... I take it European countries could look upon that as very persuasive evidence of what the convention means, and they could all begin to levy this precise kind of tax.</text>

            <text>That's not the type of concern that the United States has expressed.</text>
            <text>So, even with that finding, we would say there's no principle which would say Tennessee's tax should fail--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, General Burson, I suppose the hardest question presented here is the meaning of the conventions dealing with these containers, which clearly were entered into for the very purpose of encouraging the use of them and keeping the cost down of the users of those containers.</text>
            <text>Now, you do agree, do you, that the interpretation of the conventions by other nations who are signatories to it is relevant in our interpretation of the meaning of the convention?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles W. Burson</label>
            <text>--Justice O'Connor, it's our contention that you don't need to get to the practice for interpretation, that the textual--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, suppose we do.</text>
            <text>Is it relevant?</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_w_burson">
            <label>Mr. Charles W. Burson</label>
            <text>--If you do, it is relevant, but we would contend that what is more relevant is the position of the United States in its interpretation of the treaty to determine whether Tennessee is violative of the foreign commerce clause.</text>
            <text>That's what we're looking at.</text>

            <text>Yes.</text>
            <text>We would suggest, though, that great deference... this Court would give great deference to the interpretation of that treaty by the United States.</text>
            <text>This is in this instance a voice that we're looking to be consistent with.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, certainly Tennessee's tax here does have an effect very similar to a customs duty, as it's imposed on these containers that apparently are in Tennessee only a very short time.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_w_burson">
            <label>Mr. Charles W. Burson</label>
            <text>Now, we would disagree with that proposition, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text>If you look at the purposes of what they're trying to free these containers from, it's more than just the economic... the incidence of a tax in the form of a customs duty.</text>
            <text>What they're trying to free these containers up for... and it's in their brief, footnote 3.</text>
            <text>One of the main things is to enable these containers to flow across national boundaries without having to get unloaded, without having to comply with customs.</text>
            <text>In the United States, we have, in effect, given effect to this treaty and the interpretation, our interpretation by our Federal statutes, and by our Federal regulations, is that they are only relieved in the statute from the customs laws, that in our Federal regulations they are only relieved from duties and from complying with the necessary paperwork when they cross the territorial boundaries.</text>
            <text>So, the United States is not only here before this Court asserting that the conventions don't mean what petitioner contends, but in our very enactments, in our statutory enactments and regulations, it's reflected that we're only talking about matters of a customs nature and customs laws.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles W. Burson</label>
            <text>Well, I think we would have an apportioned income tax... excise tax on Itel's business, yes, sir.</text>
            <text>Let me mention one thing.</text>
            <text>Justice Kennedy raised the question about property taxes, and in testing this theory, in fact, really the premise in Japan Line was that Japan, who is a... I think a party to these treaties... the premise was they could impose the property tax.</text>
            <text>That's the reason California couldn't, because Japan was imposing a personal property tax on those articles.</text>
            <text>In that case, California was trying to do it on a foreign corporation, but here we have a domestic corporation.</text>
            <text>Now, if the principle is and if this Court has recognized the principle that personal property tax... taxes are assessable on these containers, it flies right in the face of the contention that this treaty means that no taxes can be imposed on these containers by virtue of their mere presence.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, suppose Itel has a 2-year lease and this container is going to go first to England and then to India and then to Japan, but it's not... the destination is not fixed for certain as of the time it goes to England.</text>
            <text>It goes first to England.</text>
            <text>In England, Itel then does some telephone calls and soliciting and it's determined that the direction of that container will be diverted and it will go back to Canada.</text>
            <text>Can England tax the transaction that resulted in that container being diverted and assigned to a new destination?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_w_burson">
            <label>Mr. Charles W. Burson</label>
            <text>It would be our position that there is nothing in the treaty or in international principle that would say it couldn't.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>That would be a multiple tax on the same transaction, though, would it not?</text>
            <text>Because your tax extends for the whole 2-year period, and England has taxed it once again, that portion of the transaction which was the reassignment of the container.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>General Burson, as I understand it, the incidence of your tax is upon the lease.</text>
            <text>It's not upon the containers themselves.</text>
            <text>It's not even a property tax on the containers.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And as I understand it, the foreign countries also have some exactions that affect the containers, as your tax does.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Because the VAT tax is upon the contents of the containers, but the value of those contents is increased for purposes of the VAT by the leasing cost that's attributable to them.</text>
            <text>So that, in effect, the lease is being taxed through the VAT anyway.</text>

            <text>The... they're using the same economic measure of the tax.</text>
            <text>Tennessee uses, as its measure for its tax, the consideration.</text>
            <text>The VAT tax, when it taxes the goods, uses at least a portion of the cost of the lease as a measure of its VAT tax.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text>That's correct.</text>
            <text>Tennessee's whole sales tax scheme... in fact, in most jurisdictions in this country, the sales tax is based upon delivery.</text>
            <text>And let make a point.</text>
            <text>These containers come into Tennessee and then they are competing for transport business within Tennessee with other commercial activity in that State, and it's this commercial activity that Tennessee is taxing, not the mere presence or even the mere transit through the State of these container leases.</text>
            <text>Quite frankly, it's much less of a tax, say, on importation than is the VAT tax, which is... really taxes the goods because they're imported and gets, within the economic measure of that tax, the cost of the lease.</text>
            <text>We would contend that controlling... let me go back to the textual aspect of the treaty one second, and that is, if everything is... our statutes, our regulations, the language of the treaty itself... says this is intended to apply to customs duties.</text>
            <text>Under the protocol of signatures, they... which is a part of the treaty, they specifically say: The terms of the present convention shall not preclude the application of national provisions or of international agreements not of a Customs nature, regulating the use of these containers.</text>
            <text>We would just contend that's further evidence that what the treaties are getting at are actually the customs... a customs type of a tax.</text>

            <text>What the concern of the foreign commerce clause is, it's our contention, is the uniformity between the States and the Federal Government, our actions in regard to policies recognized by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text>This Court's jurisprudence instructs us that in identifying those principles, the Court looks to treaties or conventions, as we're doing here, to Federal statutes, to the manner in which national laws are applied, to this Court's recognition of established doctrine of international law, and to the positions taken by the United States in proceedings before this Court.</text>
            <text>In Japan Line, there was a custom of nations against which you could measure the deviation of the California tax.</text>
            <text>In this case, we have no such recognized custom of nations.</text>
            <text>The only thing that petitioners point to, one way or another, either as a policy or as preemption doctrine, is the treaty.</text>
            <text>We would suggest that the plain language--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text>And it seems they're making the argument that the practice informs us about the meaning of the treaty, but they also seem to be suggesting that the practice in some way establishes a recognized uniform principle of international taxation, and we would contend that is just not the case.</text>
            <text>There is no such principle in relation to this form of taxation that would... in which Tennessee's... or to which Tennessee's tax is asymmetrical.</text>

            <text>The record is very skimpy on this.</text>
            <text>In fact, it's based upon one statement by a director of marketing that says, to your knowledge has any State other than Tennessee stopped to impose a sales tax on the proceeds of international cargo containers.</text>
            <text>And the director of marketing said, not to my knowledge.</text>
            <text>Their statement that no other State imposes is based upon that.</text>
            <text>In fact, there is a letter ruling from Massachusetts back in '79 after Japan Line in which that very question was posed to them, and they said their tax did apply to leases and sales of containers, and again, we'd be happy to furnish that to the Court upon request.</text>

          <heading>Argument of Edwin S. Kneedler</heading>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>The United States agrees with Tennessee that application of that State's sales tax to the lease transactions taking place entirely within its borders is not barred by either the customs conventions on containers or the foreign commerce and import-export clauses of the Constitution.</text>
            <text>A holding by this Court to that effect would be consistent with both of the national interests that are implicated in a case such as this.</text>
            <text>First, it would serve the important national interest, the interest of the Nation as a whole, of protecting the rights of the individual sovereign States to impose taxes on matters within their borders, and thereby to ensure that those engaged in foreign commerce, no less than those engaged in interstate and domestic commerce, bear their fair share of the burden of supporting State and local governments.</text>
            <text>Secondly, in the view of the United States, a holding by this Court to that effect would be consistent with the United States' interests in international relations and in foreign commerce.</text>
            <text>Our position rests on two principal points.</text>
            <text>First, the conventions on containers, the implementing statutes and regulations, as construed by the executive branch, do not bar generally applicable sales taxes of this nature.</text>
            <text>Secondly, independent of the convention, unlike in Japan Lines, there is no rule or principle of international taxation that has been accepted and recognized by the United States that bars taxes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Kneedler, Mr. Collier says that the Government has changed its position in one aspect of this case since its appearance in Japan Line in 1978.</text>
            <text>Do you agree with that contention?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>In... to some extent, yes.</text>
            <text>In Japan Line, the thrust of the Government's argument, though, was not primarily on the convention, but on the implementing statutes and regulations, which I can address in a moment.</text>
            <text>But basically the bonded warehouse-statutes involved in McGoldrick and Xerox... there was a suggestion in our brief that those same rationales would apply under the particular statute, 1322(a), that is at issue in this case.</text>
            <text>On further reflection, we think it's clear that the... that there really is not an analogy between those two provisions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, would Japan Lines have... come out the other way?</text>
            <text>Or do you think that Japan Lines should have come out the other way under your current view?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>Not at all, and we think pointedly the Court in Japan Line did not rely either on the convention or on the statutes that petitioner relies on here to invalidate the tax.</text>
            <text>The Court went beyond that.</text>
            <text>Logically they would have been antecedent to reaching the constitutional question of whether the taxes violated the commerce clause.</text>
            <text>The Court instead resolved it on that ground and, therefore, must have concluded... and did not accept the invitation of Japan Lines that the taxes violated the principle of McGoldrick or the conventions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And how about McGoldrick itself?</text>
            <text>Under your present view, would it still have come out the same?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>Yes, it would.</text>
            <text>That... the statutes involved in McGoldrick and Xerox are quite different.</text>
            <text>Those statutes involved bonded warehouses in which goods come and are essentially held at the border and are under the custody of the Customs Service, along with the warehouse person, and while they're in that custody, they are accepted... subject to extensive regulation.</text>
            <text>The statute at issue here is really quite different.</text>
            <text>It allows the goods to pierce through the border to be admitted for the delivery and pickup of goods within the United States, and they are manifestly not within the custody of the Customs Service.</text>
            <text>It's logical, just under a straightforward sense of the supremacy clause, that a State could not tax goods that are under the custody at the border of the Customs Service, but that--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>We certainly have briefs in this case from amici who think that the convention should be interpreted differently.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>--Right, and at the moment I was just interpreting or... excuse me... addressing McGoldrick and the Xerox--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>--and the Xerox cases.</text>
            <text>One last point I would like to make about the statutory point before I move on to the conventions.</text>
            <text>The statute at issue is quoted at page 10 of our brief, and it reads... it provides that instruments of international traffic, which includes containers, are exempt from the application of the customs laws to such extent and subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed in regulations or instructions of the Secretary.</text>
            <text>The statute itself contains no exemption even from the customs laws.</text>
            <text>You're referred to the regulations of the Secretary to determine what exemptions there are.</text>
            <text>The regulations of the Secretary in this case exempt containers from the customs laws and duties, both the entry and the duties requirements, but they do not... there's nothing in the regulations to which this Court should defer that would exempt the containers from State taxes.</text>
            <text>Turning to the convention now, if I may, this Court has described the conventions as designed to remove impediments to the use of containers.</text>
            <text>That's what the Court said in Japan Lines.</text>
            <text>And the conventions themselves make clear what sort of impediments were being spoken of, and those impediments are ones of a customs nature.</text>
            <text>These are, after all, conventions called customs conventions on containers, and the central obligation of the parties under the conventions is to allow temporary admission, which is admission defined in both conventions free of import duties and taxes, free of import prohibitions and restrictions.</text>
            <text>And the phrase import duties and taxes is, in turn, defined as custom duties or other taxes chargeable by reason of importation under the '56 convention or in connection with importation of goods.</text>
            <text>At every turn, there is a specific reference to importation, and the impediments to be removed are customs.</text>
            <text>The protocol of signatures reinforces that point.</text>
            <text>The protocol, by the way, is reproduced at footnote 8 of our brief.</text>
            <text>It specifically reserves to the parties the right to impose restrictions not of a customs nature.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>So, your submission is that this State tax is not by reason of or in connection with--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>Precisely.</text>
            <text>The petitioner argues that because the containers may be present in the country by reason of importation that that's enough, but the convention refers to the premise for the tax.</text>
            <text>Is the tax chargeable by reason of importation or imposed?</text>
            <text>It looks at it from the perspective of government levying the tax, not the reason why the container may be within the country.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>--So, a property tax should also be valid under your view.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>Yes, and in fact, presumably the Court... I think the Court implicitly so concluded in Japan Line itself.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Do I understand that the British Government disagrees with that proposition?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>Yes.</text>
            <text>As I understand the UK's position, it is that a tax... any tax... and they simply pick up the same point that petitioner does, that because the containers are present by reason of importation, that that's sufficient.</text>
            <text>They also rely on the purposes of the convention.</text>
            <text>But the purposes are implemented according to the specific terms of the convention.</text>
            <text>If the purposes were to be given the full scope that petitioner argues, income taxes on these would be prohibited.</text>
            <text>The tax on the repairs of the containers that petitioner doesn't even challenge would be prohibited.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>It says there's another provision in the later convention that allows taxes on the basis of services provided.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>Right, but that is something that would focus largely on the moment of importation, wharfage fees and something like that, as the goods were being entered into.</text>
            <text>That's something different from the sales tax within the United States.</text>
            <text>There's another reason why the conventions are inapplicable, and that is that they do not apply at all to the actions of the parties of the contracting State, which we've set that forth... that in our brief.</text>
            <text>And also to the extent the negotiating history of the conventions are relevant on this point, petitioners cite in their reply brief some excerpts from the negotiating history.</text>
            <text>Fairly read as a whole, those... the negotiating history cuts precisely the other way, and I would refer the Court to that if the Court addresses that question.</text>
            <text>Turning to the UK's position on the VAT tax, our point there is that the VAT tax does... the VAT does tax the value of the lease.</text>
            <text>That's our simple point.</text>
            <text>And so, if the conventions are to be given the broad scope that the UK would argue for to serve their policies, then taxing the value of the lease as included in the value of the goods should be equally preempted.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And I suppose that would be true even if, as often happens, the lessee ships an empty container.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>Well, right.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Because ultimately it would be in the cost of the goods.</text>

          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>Precisely so.</text>
            <text>And you mentioned, Justice Kennedy, earlier the question that the UK might respond by imposing a tax on lease transactions there.</text>
            <text>Our position is that that's not the sort of retaliation that the commerce clause is referring to, because just as it is our position that the United States or a State may impose a tax on a discrete transaction, so may... when delivery occurs in the United States, so may a foreign country.</text>
            <text>That's not multiple taxation.</text>
            <text>It's just the UK saying we might do what Tennessee is doing, and our position on that is fine because as in Wardair, the transaction being taxed, in that case sale of fuels... fuel, takes place entirely within the taxing jurisdiction.</text>
            <text>So that is not a threat of multiple taxation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>As pointed out by the United Kingdom in its brief, the signatory nations to this convention have followed the uniform practice of failing to impose taxes like Tennessee's for 36 years.</text>
            <text>The position of the United Kingdom and the other protesting nations, which include 8 of the original 12 nations which drafted the 1956 treaty, have posed the interpretation of the convention that is followed by Itel.</text>
            <text>So the deference that would be ordinarily given the executive branch in interpreting international law is informed by the interpretations of those nations.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text>They acceded 13 years later.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip W. Collier</label>
            <text>They take that position in this litigation, and they have prevented containers from being taxed by their own statutes.</text>
            <text>There is a uniform practice in this case, and I would point out that the only example given by the United States wasn't even alluded to by Tennessee in their brief, is the imposition of a tax on goods imported in a container.</text>
            <text>And I would like to make this for an example.</text>
            <text>If a British steamship line leases a container which is delivered in Tennessee to export a case or cases of Jack Daniels whiskey to London, certainly the taxes imposed on the container lessee by Tennessee has to be by the lessor and paid by the lessee.</text>
            <text>But the import VAT that the United States has raised in Britain only means that when a customer at a pub purchases a fifth of Jack Daniels, he has to pay an import VAT on the base price as determined under cost, insurance, and freight.</text>
            <text>There is simply no connection in that tax.</text>
            <text>There is no disincentive in that tax to the use of containers.</text>
            <text>It simply doesn't strike at the container or the container selection decision.</text>
