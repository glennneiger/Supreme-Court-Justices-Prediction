            <text syncTime="71.691" offset="428168">This case involves a First Amendment challenge by a radio station to Congress' regulatory program for broadcast lottery advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.720" offset="464321">Sections 1304 and 1307 of title 18 create a simple bright line geographically based rule under which a station's right to broadcast lottery advertising hinges on the state to which that radio station is licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.196" offset="526179">A radio station licensed to a state like Virginia that runs a state lottery can broadcast lottery advertising about that state's lottery or any other state lottery.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.146" offset="565990">By contrast, a radio station licensed to a state like North Carolina without a state lottery cannot broadcast lottery advertising about any state lottery.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.502" offset="603397">It is the validity of that bright line rule that is at issue as applied to respondent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.046" offset="629624">The district court in a divided panel of the Fourth Circuit held this regulatory program unconstitutional under the commercial speech standard this Court adopted in the Central Hudson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.182" offset="670166">Those courts reasoned that Congress had legitimate and substantial interests involved in helping the states pursue their policies towards gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.819" offset="700677">Those courts also concluded that this regulatory program was narrowly tailored to achieve that end.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.552" offset="723561">Nonetheless, those courts held these statutes unconstitutional as applied to respondent on the ground that in that circumstance it did not directly advance Congress' goals.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="155.955" offset="765252">Mr. Larkin, under a First Amendment analysis in commercial speech cases when we apply Central Hudson do we look case-by-case at an as-applied challenge or do we simply look to whether the Central Hudson test is met and it's a reasonable response to the overall problem?</text>
            <text syncTime="186.130" offset="885938">Is there such a thing as an as-applied case-by-case look in the analysis?</text>

            <text syncTime="192.534" offset="911538">Your Honor, the as-applied type of challenge that I think the court contemplated under the commercial speech basis is a challenge that would go to show that a particular broadcast in this case should not properly be treated as commercial speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.653" offset="963992">That type of as-applied challenge can always be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.933" offset="977157">We don't believe that these statutes should be construed to apply to editorials and news stories.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.476" offset="995339">In fact the decree entered by the district court in this case so construed the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.225" offset="1018326">We did not challenge that aspect of the decree in the court of appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="259.255" offset="1178405">In that case people were using the band shell in New York City Central Park.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.630" offset="1191884">The city had a regulation that was treated as a time, place, and manner regulation of the speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.253" offset="1210379">It required people using the band shell to use city equipment and have a city employee run it.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.220" offset="1230232">The city had this regulation in place to serve two competing goals, competing goals much like the competing goals at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.498" offset="1255414">It was to insure that the concerts were loud enough so that they could be heard by concert goers but not so loud that they would disrupt the surrounding communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.417" offset="1283104">The argument that was made on behalf of Rock Against Racism is that regulation doesn't serve its purposes as applied to us because we're loud enough so that everybody hears us.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.367" offset="1322914">There is no need to worry about whether or not that goal is served.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.381" offset="1334930">This Court rejected that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.051" offset="1341618">The Court said that the validity of a time, place, and manner regulation serves on the general purposes that the Government seeks to serve through the regulation and not on how it's applied in an individual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.704" offset="1384250">One week later in the case of SUNY v. Fox this Court said that the analysis under a time, place, and manner regulation is substantially similar to the analysis that is applied in the commercial speech area.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.933" offset="1433151">We think the combination of those two cases as a matter of precedent indicates that you don't look at a station-by-station approach, you don't undertake that type of analysis to decide in this case whether Congress' regulation of the broadcast spectrum is permissible.</text>

            <text syncTime="846.832" offset="3528694">But as I understand the way things can work, if you had a transmitter, if you had a station licensed to a community which permitted gambling you could have your transmitter located across the border in a state that bans gambling and you could broadcast from that state gambling announcements which would go to the community to which you're licensed since that community permits it, and would also go to the people within that state that you're broadcasting from, which is not the community you are licensed to serve.</text>

            <text syncTime="985.822" offset="4084684">I would also, however, like to say just a few words about the first point we have made in our brief which is that for purposes of the commercial speech doctrine lawful gambling should not be treated differently from illegal gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.256" offset="4126375">And the reason is gambling is one of a small category of unique products or activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.753" offset="4144452">This Court in Posadas referred to these sorts of activities, such as the consumption of alcohol and gambling and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.751" offset="4168380">What you have is a situation where they are activities that have traditionally been deemed harmful to participants and to third parties and for which there always seems to have been a black market available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.998" offset="4201399">Because they are deemed harmful to individuals in society the society has always attempted to regulate them heavily and sometimes flatly to ban them altogether, as most states do in connection with casino gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.259" offset="4242464">In some instances, however, society can rationally conclude that the costs of a flat prohibition are too injurious for society to bear, and as the result the appropriate approach to undertake is the one that Professor Epstein has called damage control, legalization and regulation where the regulation includes a ban on the advertising of that activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.596" offset="4315815">That is the sort of approach that has been undertaken for example with respect to gambling, with respect to alcohol, and other similar matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.203" offset="4346222">It's where you have that type of narrow activity, not the broad range of activities that can potentially be regulated by the Congress, by the state legislatures, and by the municipalities, that we think the rationale that was expressed in Posadas of greater includes the lesser is a reasonable rationale to apply.</text>
