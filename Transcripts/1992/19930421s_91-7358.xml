            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="81818">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in Brecht against Abrahamson.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.972" offset="101671">In this case petitioner Todd Brecht was serving time in a Georgia prison when her sister and her husband assumed temporary custody of him and took him back to their home in Alma, Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.961" offset="145661">A week later, Brecht shot and killed his brother-in-law and fled to Winona, Minnesota where he was apprehended by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.423" offset="175441">He was then returned to Wisconsin and tried for murder in the Circuit Court of Buffalo County.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.752" offset="196757">At trial, Brecht took the stand and claimed for the first time that the shooting was an accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.824" offset="217028">To impeach his testimony, the state made several references to his post-Miranda warning silence as to the accidental nature of the crime and everybody agrees this was a violation of a case we decided a number of years called Doyle against Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.259" offset="282752">The jury returned of guilty verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.747" offset="292783">The Supreme Court of Wisconsin upheld Brecht's conviction after concluding that the Doyle error was harmless under the standard of harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in the case we decided in Chapman versus California some years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.102" offset="358194">Brecht then went into the Federal Court system and sought federal habeas relief and the Federal District Court in Madison granted relief because it thought this violation that takes place during his trial was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.369" offset="419216">Then the state took the case to the Court of Appeals in the Seventh Circuit and that Court reversed and said that on collateral review after that convictions become final in the State Court system, the proper standard for determining whether the error was harmless is the one set forth in another case we decided called Kotteakos, and the standard here is more lenient than not in the Chapman standard, and applying this standard, the Court of Appeals concluded that the Doyle violation was harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.909" offset="545439">So we are now on the Sixth Court which will consider this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.157" offset="562367">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we hold that the Kotteakos harmless error standard rather than Chapman standard applies in determining whether constitutional error of this type may provide the basis for federal habeas relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.463" offset="623598">In applying that standard, we conclude that Brecht is not entitled to relief so the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.605" offset="652228">Justice Stevens has filed the concurring opinion; Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion, which is joined by Justice Blackmun in its entirety and by Justice Souter in part; Justices Blackmun, O'Connor, and Souter have also filed dissenting opinion.</text>
