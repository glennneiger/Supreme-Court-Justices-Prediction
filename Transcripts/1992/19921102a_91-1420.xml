            <label>Mr. John R. Tunheim</label>
            <text syncTime="59.455" offset="377501">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="63.240" offset="392547">Redistricting is a power and responsibility that is reserved to the States in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.644" offset="418252">This case presents the Court with an opportunity to illuminate that important principle and clarify the apparent confusion in the lower Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.166" offset="456286">I intend to direct my argument this morning to the abstention issue: did the Federal court err by refusing to abstain to an ongoing State judicial proceeding?</text>
            <text syncTime="90.574" offset="501948">And the case presents perhaps one of the most stark examples of what can go wrong when there are jurisdictional disputes in the redistricting process.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.116" offset="544058">We have a Federal court that has twice enjoined an ongoing State proceeding and enjoined a final valid judgment of a State court and wrote redistricting plans that absolutely ignored State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.589" offset="597974">And I would like to focus on the proper role of the Federal courts in the unique context of the decennial responsibility of redrawing the election districts within the boundaries of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.766" offset="650742">You cannot have two sets of rules, one drawn by the State and one by the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.937" offset="675401">The time pressures are extraordinary.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.955" offset="687418">There must be a rule that is absolutely clear on allocation of responsibilities because at stake are really the vital State interests that are involved in elections, in ensuring the integrity of election districts within States, and at stake are really important principles of federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.035" offset="767770">Prior decisions of this Court have established and reaffirmed a bright line abstention rule to be followed by Federal courts in redistricting cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.808" offset="806849">The rule is firmly grounded in the Constitution and by strong policy reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.562" offset="829837">Adherence to the rule would have eliminated the costly, wasteful, and duplicative proceedings that we had in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.084" offset="864005">Now, any discussion of the abstention rule must start by reemphasizing what is unique about the redistricting process.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.339" offset="900995">It is an inherent State function.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.958" offset="911444">This Court has emphasized that Federal courts... emphasized over and over that Federal courts must defer to State legislatures to accomplish the redistricting task, and even when Federal courts do act, they must adhere and defer to State policies that have been developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.770" offset="986676">This deference principle I believe is at the heart of the abstention doctrine for redistricting cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.609" offset="1014053">Now, this rule is limited to a relatively narrow window for the redistricting process, the roughly 10 months or so that States have after receipt of the census data and when they have to have district plans in place to run the first election after that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.189" offset="1100361">If there is a redistricting challenge in State courts, if there is such a challenge, the Federal court should abstain in favor of the State court action just as it must defer to the legislature.</text>

            <text syncTime="1240.290" offset="5100753">The interest of the United States in this case focuses on a different aspect of the proceedings below, namely the interpretation of the Voting Rights Act by the district court and specifically section 2 as amended in 1982.</text>

            <text syncTime="1261.621" offset="5186121">We do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.621" offset="5190092">Abstention is obviously a fact-intensive inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.858" offset="5211094">The principles of this Court have, obviously, indicated the importance of State procedures and that this is a State function, but the fact-intensive nature of this is such that we take no position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.819" offset="5278908">Our focus is on the merits portion of what the district court did, its interpretation of section 2, and our submission about section 2 is this, that the language of section 2, its purpose, and the underlying logic of voter dilution claims all combine to suggest that the preconditions identified by this court in the Gingles case should apply to single member district challenges as well as to the multimember district challenge at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.444" offset="5433449">That is to say that minority plaintiffs or any challenger should show that there is a sufficiently large, geographically compact group of minority voters so as to constitute a majority within a particular district, and then that the voting behavior has been characterized by racial polarization on the part of both minorities and then a white voting block in response.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.832" offset="5558941">Above all, unless there is racial block voting... and as the district court mentioned, the three-judge majority mentioned, there is no evidence at all of racial polarization here... then there is no predicate for overturning State drawn districts on a dilution claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.079" offset="5643995">If we look to what the Voting Rights Act was intended to do and we go back to 1982, the purpose of that restoration in 1982 was to codify this Court's decision in White against Regester and a wide variety of lower court cases, especially out of the Fifth Circuit, some 23 cases that preceded the City of Mobile v. Bolden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.598" offset="5766040">In all of those cases, racial block voting was present, and when we focus on the logic of a dilution claim, unless there is political cohesiveness, then there is nothing about the State's electoral structure that has interfered with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.798" offset="5854856">Not only in those cases was there block voting on the part of minority interests, but there was also racial block voting by the white majority that had the effect of cancelling out or of submerging the minority vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.259" offset="5924655">In addition, the concept of geographic compactness is closely related to the concept of what an electoral district is, that as this Court said in Gingles, unless there is geographic compactness and a large enough group to constitute a majority in the district, then a defeat at the polls is a result of the lack of numbers and not because of the kind of concerns that Congress was getting at in amending section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.098" offset="6068015">Section 2 is getting at the deprivation of equal opportunity on account of race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.371" offset="6105109">It is not getting at coalition politics, interest group politics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.692" offset="6126425">It is getting at clearing the channels of politics, of the obstacles that prevent what the statute calls an equal opportunity to participate while guarding against the danger which was part of the great compromise of 1982 of analyzing section 2 in such a way that yields up essentially powerful tendencies in favor of proportional representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.925" offset="6235303">We believe at bottom that was the vision that was guiding the district court in this particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1601.359" offset="6545115">That... I think the value... when we look at Scott against Germano and what this Court was trying to do, I think the Court was essentially saying to Federal courts please be respectful of State court proceedings, and as the Chief Justice indicated, once those State court proceedings are under way there is... and, in fact, what happened in Minnesota, as the Court knows, is that a special three-judge court was impaneled representing different parts of the State with then direct appeal to the Minnesota Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.695" offset="6662458">From all that appears, although we have no specific position here, it appears that the State court proceedings were going forward correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.401" offset="6697253">Now, if there is concerns on the part of the United States with respect to what a State court might, in fact, do, we obviously are capable of intervening and participating in that litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.160" offset="6752319">And obviously, if there is an... ultimately an incorrect interpretation of section 2 by the State court system, that obviously suggests that an appeal would... or certiorari might be appropriate in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.404" offset="6813236">The present dynamic is one that is quite frustrating because you have under the statute these three-judge district courts across the country with direct appeal to this Court, and at the same time you have this phenomenon of the parallel State proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.596" offset="6874049">It does seem to us that there is wisdom in the profederalism vision of Scott against Germano, but at the same time, we have not taken a specific position in terms of the judgment and whether it would be entitled to full faith and credit protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1701.308" offset="6944893">It does seem to us that when one analyzes the three-judge court's opinion, what it essentially said was there is a lack of proportional representation, and the bottom line and what the court did there was to create a new district, that new Senate District 59, which no one in the redistricting process, that deliberative process, hearing from various interested groups and so forth, including minority groups, no one had been recommending--</text>

            <text syncTime="1861.878" offset="7587192">I think the ultimate issue in this case is whether the Federal court properly issued both legislative and congressional redistricting plans for Minnesota in February of 1992.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.734" offset="7626585">And the appellees believe that this Court may determine that issue on the basis of the application of principles of Federal court jurisdiction and doctrines of Federal court abstention without having to determine whether the Federal court's finding of a violation of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act was clearly erroneous, if this Court so chooses, because in issuing its plans, the Federal court indicated that it was affording the same relief that it would have afforded had it not found a section 2 Voting Rights Act violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.007" offset="7771617">And appellees further believe that such a determination of this matter may be made by this Court without disturbing any precedents of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.430" offset="7805367">And first of all, this Court has recognized on numerous occasions in cases such as Colorado River that a Federal court has a virtually unflagging duty adjudicate matters before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.570" offset="7853955">The Federal court in this case had jurisdiction, and it was obligated to adjudicate the constitutional and statutory claims of the plaintiffs before it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1957.607" offset="7970043">It is a deferral case, but quite clearly, this Court told the Federal court in Illinois in that case that it should retain jurisdiction.</text>

Germano is an anomaly, and it is, as this Court knows, a case that arose as part of the spate of decisions across the country that followed Baker v. Carr and Reynolds v.

            <text syncTime="3695.436" offset="14921331">A couple of concerns to address Justice Scalia's concern about the delay involved in the State court consideration of congressional redistricting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.427" offset="14961351">The State court had before it congressional redistricting from the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.462" offset="14977442">On August 16 it set the criteria by which it would review any congressional plan that would be enacted by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.251" offset="15016626">It was stayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.051" offset="15019865">Its hand was stayed by the Federal injunction from early December until January 10 when that injunction was lifted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.590" offset="15049958">At that point, the State court once again moved forward on congressional redistricting, asking the parties to come forward and present their views on what the State court should do on congressional redistricting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.100" offset="15103979">Any delay in that process is solely attributable to the injunctions that were imposed on the State court and on the parties by the Federal panel.</text>
