            <text syncTime="8.939" offset="175411">Mr. Yurick, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark S. Yurick</label>
            <text syncTime="59.872" offset="379061">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="62.805" offset="390868">The issue presented by this case is whether the Respondents and other commercial speakers have a First Amendment right to place newsrack-type dispensing devices upon the public sidewalks of the City of Cincinnati.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.048" offset="443845">The critical inquiry here is the interpretation of the fourth prong of the Central Hudson test, which requires a governmental regulation that burdens commercial speech to burden no more speech than is necessary to further the Government's substantial governmental interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.545" offset="521794">It does not require a least restrictive means test, nor does the test require the regulation to completely accomplish the goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.567" offset="561918">In other words, the regulation is permitted to be underinclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.971" offset="583548">The fourth prong does require a balancing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.923" offset="595355">However, the Sixth Circuit in the city's opinion balanced the wrong things.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.576" offset="621895">The Sixth Circuit held that since a First Amendment right was implicated, that was to be balanced, the First Amendment, against the degree to which the interest was served.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.051" offset="667871">The correct balancing test, according to the city, is the State interest taken as a whole versus the incidental burden on speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.507" offset="709667">Like the billboards in the Metromedia case, newsracks are large, immobile, and semipermanent structures, although they do have a communicative function.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.898" offset="755224">By prohibiting Respondent's newsrack dispensing devices, Cincinnati has done no more than attempt to eliminate the problems posed by the noncommunicative presence of the newsracks.</text>

            <text syncTime="164.772" offset="798692">Well, Mr. Yurick, you suggest an analogy to the Metromedia case, but isn't the city's position here perhaps stronger, because Metromedia was a regulation of billboards on private property?</text>
            <text syncTime="178.449" offset="853445">Here, the newspapers or the distributors are simply taking over public property, are they not?</text>

            <text syncTime="184.001" offset="875597">I think that since public property is involved the city's interest in preserving that public property for all of the citizens of Cincinnati is perhaps stronger, and I believe that in the Metromedia case the prohibition was on offsite advertising, both public and private.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.795" offset="950829">I believe that the exception in Metromedia was for onsite advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.180" offset="968384">In other words, the owner of a commercial establishment could have a billboard on his own property advertising whatever goods were for sale there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2235.943" offset="9083375">That letter regulation defined as noncommercial that which is a daily or weekly publication primarily presenting coverage of or commentary on current events, and as we know from the record below, the city engineer is unable and remains unable to give a clear definition of what constitutes a noncommercial publication, notwithstanding the city manager's letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.248" offset="9212628">While the city's inability to establish clear standards with regard to a distinction between noncommercial and commercial speech is not necessary in resolving this matter, the facial infirmities of the scheme are such that it warrants further consideration insofar as it points out the difficulties in dealing with speech and with the possibilities of favoritism and bias when a city is unable to define with any certainty what constitutes commercial and what constitutes noncommercial.</text>
