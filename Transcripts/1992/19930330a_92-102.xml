            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="132915">We'll hear argument now in Number 92-102, William Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.--</text>
            <text syncTime="10.088" offset="173248">Mr. Gottesman.</text>

          <turn speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="10.949" stopTime="338.445">
            <label>Mr. Michael H. Gottesman</label>
            <text syncTime="10.949" offset="176696">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.751" offset="187877">Jason Daubert was born missing a part of his right arm and lacking three fingers on one of his hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.147" offset="225493">Eric Schuller was born missing one of his hands and with one leg shorter than the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.891" offset="248376">In both instances their parents had taken Bendectin during the first 2 months of their pregnancy, the period in which the limbs are forming in the fetus.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.180" offset="301562">There were no other indications of what might have accounted for these birth defects.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.793" offset="327997">There were no genetic histories, or anything else of the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.076" offset="341163">Each of these petitioners, with their parents, sued in the State courts of California alleging that the birth defects had been caused by Bendectin and alleging further that Merrell Dow, the sole manufacturer of Bendectin, had been culpable as a matter of State tort law in the manufacture and the distribution of the drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.371" offset="434368">Among other things, the allegations are that Merrell had concealed the discoveries in its own laboratories of the effects that this drug had on animals that were tested and that it did not provide a warning consistent with what its own internal knowledge was of the propensities of the drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.205" offset="505735">If the cases had remained in State court, it is clear that the expert testimony about causation that is the subject before you today, that that expert testimony would have been admissible as a matter of California law, and we have asserted... and the assertion is not challenged... that that evidence would also have been sufficient as a matter of California law to prove causation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.801" offset="608030">But Merrell Dow removed both cases to Federal court on diversity grounds, where they were consolidated, and ultimately Merrell moved for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.277" offset="654006">Its motion did not go to the question of culpability but solely to the question of causation, and its contention about causation was that Bendectin does not, in fact, cause birth defects in humans and that the petitioners would be unable to come forward with any admissible evidence that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.393" offset="754420">And they anticipated in the motion that the petitioners indeed would have experts who say that there is causation, but their contention was that testimony would not be admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, and in consequence the petitioners would have no admissible evidence to prove causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.087" offset="829235">Now, the petitioners countered with affidavits and testimonies of eight experts, and I think it's important to note that these are experts several of whom are very highly credentialed and important scientists in their field.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.118" offset="893287">One, Adrian Gross, has been the chief of toxicology for the Environmental Protection Agency and the chief of pathology at the Food and Drug Administration, in both roles responsible for making these very kinds of determinations about causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.208" offset="957653">Another, Shanna Swan, is the chief epidemiologist for the State of California, responsible for determining the causes of birth defects, and on... we have described others in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.435" offset="1002584">Each of these eight experts in their affidavits and testimony expressed their opinion that it is likelier than not that Bendectin is a teratogen in humans at the normal therapeutic dose, that is, that it causes birth defects in humans, and each has recited that the methodology by which they arrived at that conclusion is the methodology which is regularly and commonly employed by scientists in their fields for making these kinds of determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.167" offset="1129539">Indeed, as is shown, and as the two governmental experts testified, the methodology they used here is precisely that which they use every day in the performance of their governmental functions, and governmental regulations which we have cited in our briefs say the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.759" offset="1199860">Now, what is striking, and I think needs to be noticed, is that in this record there is nothing that challenges that the methodology that these eight experts employ is not the common and regular methodology for making these determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.219" offset="1269764">Merrell did not, in response to these affidavits, make any record demonstration, did not cite a single person who claimed that this methodology was not appropriately employed, but both courts below, responding to and accepting the contention made by Merrell Dow, concluded that the proper measure for determining admissibility of expert testimony under the Federal Rules of Evidence is that which was prescribed in the Frye test, namely that the methods and the principles on which the experts' opinions are based must be those that are generally accepted in the scientific community, and applying that standard, both courts said that that had not been demonstrated in this case by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.452" offset="1462652">Now, that poses the question of statutory construction that this case presents.</text>

          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="338.445" stopTime="352.333">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="338.445" offset="1486685">Do you say that even under the Frye test this evidence would be admissible, or as we take the case it's either Frye applies or it doesn't?</text>

            <text syncTime="352.333" offset="1542169">Well, it was the contention below, the Ninth Circuit having already adopted the Frye case before this case, the petitioners were obliged to argue to the Ninth Circuit that this evidence is admissible even under the general acceptance test of Frye's--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="367.294" stopTime="368.756">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="367.294" offset="1602042">What base... is that issue here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="368.756" stopTime="484.814">
            <label>Mr. Michael H. Gottesman</label>
            <text syncTime="368.756" offset="1607893">--It is here only in the sense that the sole reason the Ninth Circuit gave for saying that this was not generally accepted was its conclusion, again not drawn from the record, that scientists will not accept the opinions of experts and their methodologies unless those experts have published and had peer review of the opinions that they proffer.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.162" offset="1705486">Now, we do contend that as an assertion of what constitutes general acceptance, even were that the test, that that is an incorrect and a... not only incorrect as a matter of fact, because the record shows that indeed scientists do, and a number of scientific organizations have cited that... that it is both incorrect as a statement of science and incorrect as a construction of the Federal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.889" offset="1808409">That is, that Publication and peer review is not a prerequisite for the admission of scientific expert testimony under the Federal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.356" offset="1846339">But Your Honor has shaped, I think, the way in which the statutory construction issue has to be addressed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.050" offset="1873088">The first question is whether the test that the Ninth Circuit applied is indeed the correct construction of this Federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.595" offset="1903286">That is, does it require general acceptance?</text>
            <text syncTime="444.698" offset="1911645">If the answer to that is no, and there seems to be a rather wide consensus among the various groups in this case that it should be no, the Court then does have to address, I think, well, what is the correct construction of the Federal rules so that, whether it's going to decide this itself or remand for reconsideration, there will be a determination of what the standard is.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.183" offset="2001611">And what I'd like to do is go through the statutory construction analysis in that two-step way, first demonstrating that general acceptance is not the test, which I think is rather the easier point, and then addressing what is the correct instruction, as to which--</text>

            <text syncTime="484.814" offset="2072141">In making that argument, Mr. Gottesman, I hope you will address whether under Rule 702 the words, "scientific knowledge", tell us anything about what's required.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.278" offset="2149986">Webster's Dictionary defines 702 doesn't suggest some notion of accepted knowledge.</text>

            <text syncTime="538.259" offset="2285927">--Well, let me jump ahead to that, Your Honor, although I do want to ultimately get back to laying a firmer foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.994" offset="2312886">702 says that if scientific knowledge will assist the court a qualified expert may testify thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.411" offset="2354473">We agree that the word "thereto" qualifies the words, "scientific knowledge", so really the question is what is the importance of the word "thereto" as it relates to scientific knowledge?</text>
            <text syncTime="566.759" offset="2399926">What the advisory committee note says... and we suggest that this is very informative.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.703" offset="2423645">I'd like to read it and then relate it to this case:</text>
            <text syncTime="574.616" offset="2431377">"The rule recognizes that an expert on the stand may give a dissertation or exposition of scientific or other principles relevant to the case, leaving the trier of fact to apply them to the facts. "</text>
            <text syncTime="587.465" offset="2482682">Now, it then goes on and says,</text>
            <text syncTime="590.277" offset="2493966">"The use of opinions is not abolished by the rule, however. "</text>
            <text syncTime="593.556" offset="2507132">"It will continue to be permissible for the expert to take the further step of suggesting the inference which should be drawn from applying the specialized knowledge to the fact. "</text>
            <text syncTime="605.174" offset="2553526">so that what the drafters contemplated in 702 is that the expert would set forth what is known scientifically, and from that would be permitted to infer what should be concluded from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.827" offset="2620190">Now, in this case, if you read the testimony of these experts, they are putting forth scientific knowledge on every page.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.212" offset="2653731">They go through an explanation of what all of the animal studies have shown, how to interpret them, what their significance is--</text>

            <text syncTime="1654.774" offset="6751926">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.239" offset="6773868">In our view, scientific knowledge, which is what Rule 702 allows an expert to testify to, is that body of propositions which have been produced by the methods and procedures of science, and it is the heart of our claim that the propositions offered by petitioner's witnesses have not been produced by the methods and procedures of science.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.209" offset="6905735">As the Court in the Turpin case said regarding petitioner's crucial witness here... and I say crucial, because it is the only witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.327" offset="6954218">Dr. Palmer, he's the only witness to testify that it is his opinion that Bendectin caused the limb defects of these petitioners... said of Dr. Palmer,</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.446" offset="7002597">"Personal opinion, not science, is testifying here. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.540" offset="7022972">"No known basis is offered. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.282" offset="7033944">So we do not speak about propositions that have attained the level of certainty of the laws of gravity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.187" offset="7061633">I think that this contention shows the whole procedure of the petitioners and their amici attack on what not only this Court... not only on the courts below but a number of courts have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.559" offset="7131119">They caricature what it is that the courts below have said about the requirement of publication and peer review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.746" offset="7167899">None of those courts have said, and it would have been an absurd thing to say, that scientific opinions or propositions may not be testified to if they have not been published.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.342" offset="7214188">There are many scientific opinions which are either too particular, too fresh, or of too limited interest to be able to attain publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.211" offset="7265702">What these courts have said is that publication and dissemination to the scientific community is a factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.849" offset="7304259">The Downing-DeLuca court, say the Third Circuit, specifically said that it is a factor in determining the reliability of scientific evidence whether it has been exposed... and I believe I used the Third Circuit's own words... exposed to scientific scrutiny.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="1853.330" offset="7546153">Well, as to the opinion of the Ninth Circuit, I think that is virtually... that opinion is virtually a summary affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.895" offset="7580425">There are some judges who take about 5 pages for a summary affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.398" offset="7594427">In fact, the Ninth Circuit specifically stated that it was incorporating the judgments on the same packet of opinions in the First, the D.C., and the Fifth Circuits, as they said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.499" offset="7654822">"for the reasons stated by our sister circuits. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.861" offset="7668301">and those opinions are very detailed, go into the witnesses' testimony in great detail, and that is incorporated by reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.529" offset="7710933">The Ninth Circuit, having seen that the Federal courts have passed on this a number of times, simply incorporated that by reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.495" offset="7746877">Now, it's quite clear that the Ninth Circuit was relying on Rule 702.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.501" offset="7770910">It cited the Solomon case, and the Solomon case is a 702 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.426" offset="7794525">The district court relied on Rule 703.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.709" offset="7815736">The Lynch court, the First Circuit, whose opinion was adopted by reference by the Ninth Circuit, relied on 703 and 403.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.394" offset="7858473">Now, Frye, I think, is simply a shorthand way of designating an approach, and this is another one of the caricatures which the petitioners are required to emit in order to take a very general approach and make it seem extreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.076" offset="7937153">The Frye rule is a very brief sentence in a very brief opinion in 1923.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.170" offset="7961499">It represents an approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.393" offset="7974456">It is an approach which says, and it was familiar in the Federal courts, it was stated very well by Judge Hand in 1901, that the courts must look to scientific standards to validate scientific claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.322" offset="8034120">Now, that approach, which I submit is very general, is an approach which reappears in the Federal rules, and why should it not?</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.290" offset="8074035">The very words which Justice O'Connor was emphasizing... scientific knowledge... bring that approach into the Federal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.636" offset="8111442">Why should that approach have been abandoned without a word?</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.499" offset="8130877">Now, if there had been something like a determinate rule... the Frye rule... then there would be an argument, and I would think we would be in equipoise at best but the Frye rule itself is a rather ambiguous... very ambiguous statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.972" offset="8208722">If you look at what the Frye rule itself is... let me read it to you from that decision:</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.067" offset="8229098">"The thing from which the deduction is made must be sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.953" offset="8268699">That leaves many questions unanswered, and what I suggest is, it is representative of an approach that there must be a foundation, the foundation must be a foundation in scientific knowledge, and that the courts look to the community of science and to scientific standards to validate scientific claims.</text>
