            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="133635">We'll hear argument next in number 91-1695, Pioneer Investment Services Company v. Brunswick Associates Limited Partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.249" offset="182536">Mr. Donaldson, you may proceed when you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="craig_j_donaldson" startTime="39.948" stopTime="415.523">
            <label>Mr. Craig J. Donaldson</label>
            <text syncTime="39.948" offset="293400">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="44.779" offset="312731">This case comes to the Court from a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which allowed the respondents who were claimants in Pioneer's chapter 11 case to file their proofs of claim out of time based upon a finding by the Sixth Circuit that their failure to file within the originally prescribed deadline was the result of excusable neglect.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.571" offset="435819">To reach that result, the Sixth Circuit adopted a test that was first enunciated in the Ninth Circuit in the case of In re Dix and has been referred to frequently as the liberal interpretation of excusable neglect focusing on five factors set forth in that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.168" offset="538219">The Sixth Circuit also, to reach the result that it did, had to consider an equitable factor which was, in its opinion, there was no prejudice to the debtor to allow these proofs of claim to be filed under the excusable neglect standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.170" offset="614288">And finally, what it had to do, contrary to the decision of this Court in Link v. the Wabash Railroad decided some 30 years ago, said that it was inappropriate for the courts below to punish the respondents for the neglect of their counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.484" offset="707493">We suggest to the Court that this opinion clearly is wrong on all three counts and must be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.480" offset="743542">The first error is in the adoption of the test itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.316" offset="770814">Petitioner submits to the Court that the test adopted by the Sixth Circuit and followed by the Ninth does violence to and runs plainly contrary to the plain language of rule 9006(b)(1) itself, which states that where, as here, a motion for an extension of time was filed after the deadline has expired, the court has to find that the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.138" offset="910099">As the Eleventh Circuit stated, and we contend properly so, in the South Atlantic case, the words failure to act in the plain language of the rule limit the focus of the inquiry to the actions or inactions of the movant and to the reasons for their failure to act within the time provided, and that they do not permit, as the Ninth Circuit has done and the Sixth Circuit has done in this case, consideration of factors other than why didn't they do what they were supposed to do within the time they were supposed to do it, and what were the reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.989" offset="1097553">The concept that there is no prejudice to the debtor we submit under the authorities, not only the Eleventh Circuit, but in the decisions of the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Eleventh Circuits that we have cited in our briefs, all hold uniformly that there is no room for consideration of so-called equitable factors in determining whether the failure to act under rule 9006 is a result of excusable neglect.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.221" offset="1238510">The bankruptcy code quite clearly in section 1111(a) dictates who must in a chapter 11 case file a proof of claim, and it says that if your claim is listed as disputed, contingent, or unliquidated, you must file a proof of claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.579" offset="1343940">Bankruptcy rule 3003 supplementing the code section goes on to say also that if your claim is not listed or you do not agree with the amount listed on the debtor's schedule, you must file a proof of claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.420" offset="1407261">And the facts here clearly show that three of the respondents were listed as disputed and unliquidated, and one was not listed at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.139" offset="1458148">We submit to the Court that the congressional intent that underlies section 1111 in the bankruptcy rules is to clearly place an affirmative duty on creditors who fall within the definition of the code and rules to file their proofs of claim if they want to be able to participate in the debtor's chapter 11 reorganization in three very important respects: one, to have their claim allowed; two, to have a right to vote on the plan of reorganization; and three, and probably most importantly, to receive a distribution from the debtor's estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.447" offset="1635362">And as the decisions of the other courts of appeals that we have cited in our brief recognize, there was a congressional intent underlying this section requiring these creditors to file these claims to promote certainty and finality in chapter 11 proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.261" offset="1718641">And these courts, contrary to the Sixth Circuit in this case and the Ninth Circuit in the Dix case, say that this congressional intent precludes courts from finding exceptions based on equitable considerations or equitable factors.</text>

          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="415.523" stopTime="423.879">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="415.523" offset="1795650">Well, Mr. Donaldson, I guess this case may turn on what we mean by excusable neglect under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.938" offset="1825325">Would you agree?</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="426.491" offset="1839535">And what's our test for excusable neglect?</text>
            <text syncTime="430.131" offset="1854059">What does that mean, do you suppose?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Craig J. Donaldson</label>
            <text syncTime="431.994" offset="1861583">Excusable neglect, as I'm sure the Court knows, is nowhere defined in the bankruptcy code or the rules and, for that matter, is nowhere defined in the similar rule 6 of the Federal Rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.773" offset="1924695">The Eleventh Circuit in the South Atlantic case defined excusable neglect as follows: the failure to timely perform a duty that was due to circumstances which were beyond the reasonable control of the person whose duty it was to perform.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="470.419" stopTime="477.343">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="470.419" offset="2015287">Well, why is that definition any improvement on the statutory language?</text>
            <text syncTime="474.082" offset="2029916">It doesn't seem to say anything more than excusable neglect.</text>

          <turn speaker="craig_j_donaldson" startTime="477.343" stopTime="513.206">
            <label>Mr. Craig J. Donaldson</label>
            <text syncTime="477.343" offset="2042977">I think it is an improvement, Mr. Chief Justice, for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.956" offset="2065442">When the statute talks about excusable neglect in this definition which says... the essential part being beyond the reasonable control, granted it is somewhat nebulous, but I think it clearly implies that when you come into court saying excusable neglect, you have to come in and present circumstances that are unique or extraordinary, that are beyond--</text>

            <text syncTime="529.609" offset="2252061">Rule 60(b), where you would come in to ask to set aside a default judgment entered by the court, talks about excusable neglect.</text>

            <text syncTime="557.285" offset="2362716">If I may expound, though.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.027" offset="2369717">I think Congress, by using the term excusable neglect, certainly left it to the courts to exercise their discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.592" offset="2407960">However, as this Court said not too many years ago in United States v. Boyle, what elements constitute excusable neglect is a question of law that clearly is unsettled, and we are asking the Court here today in this case to settle it.</text>

            <text syncTime="591.748" offset="2500538">Well, don't you think it's rather strange to talk about events beyond somebody's control when you're trying to define excusable neglect?</text>

I'd like to refer to a case... an opinion that Justice Scalia wrote for the majority in 1988, Pierce v.

            <text syncTime="2389.880" offset="9693093">And Justice Scalia, writing for the majority, said that the Court was going to eschew what Justice Scalia and the Court termed a rigorously scientific approach and said because of the large number of possible situations in which the phrase might arise, that it was inappropriate to draw a set of narrow guidelines, that this was simply an area in which the court... the lower courts had to have a substantial amount of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.798" offset="9800822">And the Court also said that it would not choose to substitute a different formula for the formula substantially justified which had been chosen by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.274" offset="9842722">We think that that holding is applicable to this case also because what the petitioner is seeking to do, Your Honors, is to substitute new words for the words that exist in the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.731" offset="9888489">They want the rule to read that an extension of time may be granted where the failure to act was due to circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the moving party, and that's simply not what the rule says.</text>

            <text syncTime="2480.880" offset="10057135">You'd have a whole lot of discretion still within the meaning of excusable so long as it's limited to factors affecting the subjective actions of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.739" offset="10116590">And then you would have additional discretion at the back end because even when the court finds excusable neglect, it need not... it may, as the rule says, but it need not use that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2656.785" offset="10760770">If it's intentional, then the element of good faith comes in and good faith might well be decisive if it's intentional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.021" offset="10789713">But the point is that the petitioner's test fails to allow any of these things to be weighed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.965" offset="10813433">We say that they should weigh the prejudice to other parties, other creditors, prejudice to the court essentially in the impact on judicial administration, good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.660" offset="10848228">There's a fourth element that I would suggest that would go into the calculus properly which is not covered in our brief, and that is what is the nature of the deadline missed and what is the impact on the moving party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.557" offset="10891800">Keeping in mind that this rule applies, as I said, to virtually any filing, under the Federal rules, it applies to answers, it applies to discovery responses, it applies to briefs, it applies to proofs of claim, it applies to notices of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.836" offset="10948956">And the way you weigh these factors, and particularly the good faith factor, might vary from case to case, but that's what discretion is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.592" offset="10983960">And that's the type of discretion that the Court allowed the trial courts in Pierce v. Underwood, and we submit that that discretion is appropriate here because on the face of the rule it says that the court may in its discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.861" offset="11037041">Your Honor, there's another point that I would like to make about the source of this beyond reasonable control test because that test, obviously, is not one that appears on the face of the rules or the bankruptcy code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.012" offset="11105586">It's not in the plain language of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.013" offset="11117602">Where do we find it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.965" offset="11121468">The petitioner finds that... and this is the linchpin of their argument because it appears in the very first section of the argument portion of their brief, and the rest of their argument flows from the need for finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.542" offset="11171728">And they say, well, there's a need for finality that was articulated by the lower courts, and they cite to a Second Circuit opinion in a case called Hoos v. Dynamics Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.319" offset="11210807">And they cite this need for finality there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.570" offset="11219898">And the reason that's so important to the petitioner is that without this need for finality that they find in the bankruptcy code, an overriding need in their view, you really can't get to the beyond reasonable control language because it's just not in the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.169" offset="11278308">But in the Hoos v. Dynamics Corporation, the court did discuss the need for finality, but... and perhaps it was an overriding or the most important need there, but the circumstances were entirely different than they are today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.461" offset="11335464">In that case, it was decided under the old Bankruptcy Act, and in that case creditors in a chapter 11 case had until virtually the end of the bankruptcy process in which to file their proofs of claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.440" offset="11391366">Proofs of claim had to be filed by confirmation of the plan, not before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.714" offset="11408397">That, as the Court knows, is virtually the last step in the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.595" offset="11427937">In Hoos, the creditors were actually attempting to file their claims after the plan had already been confirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.069" offset="11457821">So, of course, there was a need for finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.252" offset="11470569">There's always a need... a greater need for finality at the end of the case, but the petitioners seek to extrapolate from that and say, well, in Hoos there was a need for finality at the end of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.301" offset="11514768">Therefore, there's a need for finality here at the beginning of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.303" offset="11534830">Obviously, it just doesn't follow, and without that supposed need for finality, the overriding need for finality, they simply can't get to this beyond reasonable control test because that's the need that has driven every court of appeal that has decided and articulated this beyond reasonable control test.</text>

            <text syncTime="2965.438" offset="11995317">That plan, incidentally, was formulated after... the plan had not begun being drafted at the time this time extension was sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.806" offset="12040770">So, the plan anticipated... because the litigation over the filing of these claims was going on while the debtor was drafting its plan, the plan anticipated and planned for the eventuality that these claims would be permitted or would be allowed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3009.216" offset="12170442">Would there be any virtue in tying the phrase excusable neglect in this bankruptcy rule into the provisions of rule 60(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure where I'm sure there must be some decisions construing the same phrase?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_a_lucas" startTime="3025.295" stopTime="3163.267">
            <label>Mr. John A. Lucas</label>
            <text syncTime="3025.295" offset="12234807">Your Honor, I think that whatever decision this Court makes necessarily... even if the Court attempts to limit it to proofs of claim and bankruptcy rule 9006, that whatever decision this Court makes will be construed as also governing rule 6 and all the filings in Federal civil litigation simply because the rule, for all intents and purposes, are identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.393" offset="12335117">And the phrase excusable neglect, if the Court is going to avoid the one-subsection-at-a-time approach to the statutory construction, if we're going to avoid that, it seems to me that it has to be construed uniformly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.843" offset="12400946">If it's going to be an absolute, strict standard allowing no exceptions except for matters beyond the moving party's reasonable control here, then the same must be true for a party who files an answer 1 day late in a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.023" offset="12461655">And let me use that example, if I may, to sort of highlight the everyday litigation problems that would flow from the rule proposed by petitioners if it were accepted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.581" offset="12507944">Let's take a hypothetical example of a defendant in a lawsuit who is served with a summons and, of course, required to answer in 20 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.305" offset="12542843">But through an administrative error, clerical breakdown, whatever, through neglect, for reasons within his control, the defendant doesn't answer the lawsuit, say, a $7 million lawsuit, until the 21st day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.835" offset="12600939">9:00 the next morning, his answer is 9 hours late.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.538" offset="12615777">Today, I submit and I believe that in most jurisdictions around the country, most district judges will think that it's in the exercise of their discretion to allow an answer to be filed 9 hours late rather than to deprive a party of his or her day in court and essentially impose a windfall to the plaintiff, who at that point would have a $6.9 million default judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.973" offset="12709504">But it is precisely that sort of exercise of discretion that the petitioners would deprive the trial courts of exercising if their hard and fast, inflexible rule is accepted in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.654" offset="12764153">If there are no other questions, that completes my comments.</text>

            <label>Mr. Craig J. Donaldson</label>
            <text syncTime="3167.298" offset="12802814">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.354" offset="12831026">The respondents say that the test that we advance here is inflexible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.430" offset="12859343">What I would say to the Court on behalf of the petitioner is the test advanced here by the respondent is no test at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.935" offset="12893302">It leads to an unbridled, unchecked discretion vested in lower courts that, in effect, any time someone comes in with any excuse, whatever it may be, that a deadline is going to be extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.087" offset="12965922">And as I said earlier in our argument, in construing this term, it cannot be construed such that it just sweeps away deadlines imposed by other rules of the court which are necessary to the efficient administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.366" offset="13031019">In particular reference to the Sixth Circuit opinion below, the only way that the Sixth Circuit found the bankruptcy court and district court abused this discretion was predicated on the finding that it was inappropriate to penalize the party for the negligence of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.169" offset="13110223">Had it not found that, and had it found that it should have penalized, as the bankruptcy court and district court did, the respondents for the neglect of their counsel, the Sixth Circuit could not have found that the bankruptcy court and district court abused their discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3261.521" offset="13179708">Well, if you want to... I suppose the real party in interest is the client, and if you want to impose a rule that this is excusable if it's due to something... some act beyond your control, surely in this case the negligence of his lawyer was beyond his control.</text>

            <text syncTime="3284.577" offset="13271868">But I think the rule looks, Justice White, at the negligence of the party and the party's counsel, and if one of them is at fault... well, at least in the context of the client, if the lawyer is at fault, the client I think under Link has to suffer the consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.400" offset="13351176">But ultimately the system allocates the burden properly because the client still has, which is exactly what has been done in this case, its action against... over against the attorney for whatever damages it sustained as a result of his negligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3324.391" offset="13431111">Finally, to answer one point... two points of Mr. Lucas very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.766" offset="13456606">He says that from the Hoos case and the need for finality came out of the Bankruptcy Act because at that point you filed plans of confirmation, and he seems to imply that the need for finality and certainty is less now under the bankruptcy code and rules than it was under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.359" offset="13531003">And I submit it's exactly in reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.541" offset="13543751">The bankruptcy code and rules now say that the court shall fix the time within which claims are to be filed.</text>
