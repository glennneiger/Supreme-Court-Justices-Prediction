            <text syncTime="6.875" offset="164693">Mr. Chief Justice of the United States, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.450" offset="190920">Dorsie Johnson was 19 when he accepted the gun from Amanda Miles and, at her urging, entered the Allsup's convenience store and shot Jack Huddleston to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.739" offset="240134">In the punishment phase of his trial for capital murder, the jury was limited to answering two special issues under the former Texas statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.224" offset="282035">Issue one, deliberately.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.637" offset="295723">The statute has a text.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.787" offset="304291">It mandates a narrow mens rea inquiry into the deliberateness of the act that proximately caused death.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.304" offset="334384">The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, whose cases respondent hardly cites and does not discuss, has so construed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.950" offset="368970">Indeed, respondent's reference at page 40 of its brief to how the issue might be construed is plain wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.084" offset="397496">One need only look at Farris v. State in which the Court of Criminal Appeals said that the fact the defendant had a gun was enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.090" offset="429470">Hardly more than intentional said the court in Farris, that is to say, the element of which Mr. Johnson had just been convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.685" offset="463952">No, said the Court of Criminal Appeals in Farris.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.048" offset="477326">The issue doesn't even ask as much about the defendant's state of mind as the element of premeditation which, of course, was universally a part of first degree murder statutes after the Pennsylvania statutory compromise of 1792.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.286" offset="534273">Deliberately, as the district attorney said to the jurors here, can be two blinks of an eye.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.289" offset="562276">The issue does not call for a reasoned moral response, but a narrow factual one, a construction we submit is supported by this Court's discussion Arrave v. Creech.</text>

            <text syncTime="180.779" offset="860281">But also there is this consensus, Justice O'Connor, the consensus that in the States that give an instruction on youth, the generality of those States... and the roll call was called in Stanford v. Kentucky... leave it to the jury, guided by cautionary instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.799" offset="928304">Another approach is to say up to the age of 21 or 22.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.542" offset="1243341">If we're looking not for numbers, Justice O'Connor, but for characteristics, I think there's no more eloquent statement of what you are like at 19 as an adolescent than Dorsie Johnson's father's statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="334.759" offset="1476144">And it seems to me that what you're arguing for is ultimately going to be that there should be a general instruction on mitigating evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="379.660" offset="1655762">Again, I think if we look at the issue of deliberately, this Court of Criminal Appeals has looked at that issue with respect specifically to youth.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.507" offset="1695155">And in Zimmerman v. State, on the 9th of April 1993, they said that youth can be aggravated, indeed, that it was properly so considered in Zimmerman's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.555" offset="1751370">And, therefore, the Court of Criminal Appeals has shut off any consideration of youth for whatever worth youth may have as a mitigating factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.262" offset="1790241">We regard that as a direct assault upon the language that you, Justice Kennedy, used for the Court in Saffle v. Parks at page 493 in which you said that the State must not cut off full and fair consideration of mitigating evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="436.277" offset="1882296">And my question is why is youth, under your submission in this case, any different than these other tragic instances that we've adverted to and that are present in this case and so many other capital cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="458.910" offset="1972784">The trial judge, however, shut off their inquiry rejecting proposed instructions the defendant had proposed, and instructing the jury at joint appendix 147 at the top paragraph that the jurors were limited to answering the special issues that had been submitted to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.492" offset="2035165">Second, Justice Kennedy, we know, after Graham v. Collins, that we've got to confront and look at what this Court has done since 1984, and that's the answer it respectfully seems to us to your second question.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.053" offset="2105382">Graham invited, indeed required, that kind of careful look.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.077" offset="2129519">We take the Graham conclusion as being reasonable jurists would not in 1984 have been compelled to the conclusion we seek.</text>

            <text syncTime="507.644" offset="2167762">The key phrase we submit is reasoned moral response not because we think the phrase is talismanic, but because it well describes what the Court has done since 1987.</text>

            <text syncTime="548.761" offset="2332229">That tradition of Lockett and Eddings, which was summoned up again in Stanford v. Kentucky, is what identifies youth as such a factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.807" offset="2376428">A troubled family background may also be such a factor, and the Court may have to reach that in another case.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.801" offset="2404327">The question for us, therefore, Justice Kennedy, is how is it, since 1984 or 1987, has the teaching of Lockett and Eddings that identifies this uniquely powerful factor focused on the sentencing process, and as to that, we put alongside Sumner v. Shuman, Stanford and Penry because there you rejected the categorical imperative of life.</text>

            <text syncTime="1123.505" offset="4631214">I would also suggest another guidepost for the Court as it approaches this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.900" offset="4656709">The State, after all, has said that the case ought to be tested under Saffle and Boyde.</text>

            <text syncTime="1149.471" offset="4735076">And we submit, of course, that it is far more than a reasonable likelihood that these issues do not permit such consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.320" offset="4770394">Now, respondent does suggest... and this... I know some of the Court's questions evoke it... that, after all, the jurors heard the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.113" offset="4797561">After all, the jurors were aware that... what the effect of their questions would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.948" offset="4816996">But that, we respectfully suggest is another way of saying that jurors might disregard their oaths and specific instructions, a concept this Court has rejected in other settings, in Griffin v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.003" offset="4869137">So, in sum, the respondent doesn't address reasoned moral response.</text>

            <text syncTime="1189.729" offset="4896095">It doesn't address what the Court of Criminal Appeals has done in these cases that we have cited and talked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.933" offset="4924934">It doesn't trace what we submit this Court has taught, particularly since 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.476" offset="4943116">And ultimately and critically, respondent says, well, the jurors might have done it anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.411" offset="4966835">That last notion strikes very deep I respectfully submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.815" offset="4988464">In Morgan v. Illinois, the Court held, and in so doing rejected in rather strong terms a dissent that argued the contrary, that if even one juror would not follow the instructions to apply mitigating evidence, that the verdict could not stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.124" offset="5057636">What we are saying here is that when all 12 jurors are deprived of any vehicle at all to express their reasoned moral response, that matters are much worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.851" offset="5100582">This process to which the Court directs our attention, this adversary process... Dorsie Johnson, his early life filled with horrors, as has been acknowledged in some of the discussion here, driven out into the arms to these peers who traced this path of violence and substance abuse, his father saying 19 is a foolish age... I respectfully submit that no advocate in this Court who has ever confronted a jury to try a case that involves some aspect of the human condition can doubt that this evidence to a properly instructed jury would have unique power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.976" offset="5241016">And we respectfully suggest that this Court's emphasis on the adversary inquiry, by which life or death is determined, requires that a jury have such instructions so that its response may be a moral one, guided, to be sure as this Court has warned in Brown and Saffle, but also taking account of the core value of this mitigating evidence.</text>

I don't know... a couple of years, 3, 4, 5 years... the kind of youthful lack of judgment could continue to be a dangerous factor, then on those three premises, in effect, the jury would be in a bind, given the instructions they got, because there would, on the one hand, be an obligation to give mitigating effect to relevant mitigating evidence, but that on the facts of the case, there would have been no way to do it because the so-called mitigating evidence could not have been considered in any way favorable to the defendant under deliberateness and could only have been considered as a... as an aggravating factor on the question of future dangerousness.</text>

            <text syncTime="3063.184" offset="12389894">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.919" offset="12408807">In answer to Justice Kennedy's last question, it is, of course, true that Texas has amended article 37.071 of its Code of Criminal Procedure and now provides expressly a question that gives this life option by asking in terms about moral blameworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.867" offset="12472650">Texas, thus, makes it unanimous among the States by asking some form of question that is a... an inclusive question, but with respect to how you treat the answers to the questions one asks jurors, it is not our position that the independent life option must be provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.593" offset="12559481">The States are free to shape and guide how the sentencer deals with answers to questions that are clearly put.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.906" offset="12588739">In that connection, I think it's worth noting that counsel here, contrary to the assertion made, did seek to give the jurors a life option.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.142" offset="12625728">At joint appendix 128, there's the requested instruction as to whether mitigating outweighs aggravating so the defendant can be rehabilitated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.808" offset="12656343">So, there was some effort to ameliorate, which was turned back by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.810" offset="12672435">But more significantly, in our respectful submission, what has happened since 1984 and particularly since 1987 is that this adversary process is supposed to work in a particular way, and the respondent is plain wrong in not recognizing that a majority of this Court said in Saffle v. Parks that the State may not cut off full and fair consideration... not some consideration, not a little bit, not by torturing the language, but full and fair consideration.</text>
