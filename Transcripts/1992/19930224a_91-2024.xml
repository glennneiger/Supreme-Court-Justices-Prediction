            <text syncTime="257.861" offset="1181359">So... but here, and I think what's relevant here is this is not a question of where, Justice White, they've eliminated or construed their statute to remove the subject matter of family issues from the permissible speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.184" offset="1246665">This is not a question of whether the speech topic was permissible, nor is this really a question of whether the group was entitled to access.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.286" offset="1274982">Clearly the admission policy, the use policy of the school district states that it is open to not-for-profit outside groups.</text>

            <text syncTime="3491.862" offset="14117300">The way I understand the respondents' argument, the atheists are in, the agnostics are in, the communists are in, the religion is not in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.797" offset="14149065">In fact, even if it was a debatable point, as Justice Thomas just said, only one side of the debate is heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.249" offset="14170903">That's exactly what we've been asserting in our briefs and that's exactly what they've conceded in their briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.452" offset="14191697">This is the type of viewpoint discrimination that this Court has not sanctioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.556" offset="14208102">And I'd also point out that this establishment clause concern has already been addressed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3520.169" offset="14230567">Widmar is this Court's precedent, Mergens is this Court's precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.253" offset="14246867">We're talking about a policy of equal access, and if the communists can come in and give their view on family life and others could give their view on family life, but you allow religion... I think if there's an establishment clause, it... it violates... their policy violates the establishment clause by interfering with religion.</text>
