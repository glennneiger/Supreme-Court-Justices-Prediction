            <text syncTime="11.550" offset="193783">Our Nation's prisons are dangerous places.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.753" offset="206531">We take our most troubled and troublesome citizens, we put them behind walls for our protection and their rehabilitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="41.720" offset="314469">It is in recognition of those consequences that 35 States, the United States District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and three territories, ask you to reverse a Ninth Circuit opinion that is not only in direct conflict with opinions of other circuit courts, but severely impacts the serious decisions confronting the men and women who run our Nation's over 1,300 prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.236" offset="408510">The respondent in this case was convicted of murder and is serving his sentence in the Nevada prison system.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.079" offset="431811">In 1987 he filed a civil rights complaint alleging he had shared a cell with a series of inmates who were heavy smokers and that prison officials had done nothing to separate smoking and nonsmoking inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.958" offset="483429">He also alleged certain medical symptoms as a result of exposure to secondary cigarette smoke, and that the exposure constituted cruel and unusual punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="102.061" offset="555841">That complaint launched the case that is before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.543" offset="569738">The question is whether, as the Ninth Circuit has held, the respondent has stated a valid Eighth Amendment claim.</text>

            <label>Mr. Cornish F. Hitchcock</label>
            <text syncTime="1816.093" offset="7411939">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.701" offset="7454361">Before addressing the question presented on the merits, I would like to take a few moments to respond to the questions from the Court about the present nature of the controversy, particularly some of the opening questions from Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.250" offset="7500546">2 years ago the court of appeals ruled that Mr. McKinney is entitled to seek an injunction regarding the conditions of his confinement at the Nevada State Prison in Carson City.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.726" offset="7538476">Shortly after that, as the questioning indicated, he was moved to a new facility where he has been located for the last 2 years, or assigned for the last 2 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.591" offset="7573898">Second, he no longer shares a 6 foot by 8 foot cell with somebody who smokes five packs of cigarettes a day, which amounts to one cigarette every 10 minutes during every waking hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.667" offset="7614231">And third, there is a new written policy that is far more explicit than the informal practice cited before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.442" offset="7641294">And I'd like to respond more specifically to Justice O'Connor's question, because I think it is not entirely accurate to say that the new written policy... which, by the way, took effect prior to trial in this case, although we were not told that until the reply brief stage in this case... is a little more explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.541" offset="7701689">The informal policy previously in question is cited in the Joint Appendix at page 22, paragraph 4, the affidavit of Donald Helling, who was the classification officer at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.100" offset="7751948">Now, this affidavit was not part of the record at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.792" offset="7766681">It was submitted in connection with the preliminary injunction papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.735" offset="7782459">Mr. Helling was planning to testify, as I understand it, but he did not, in fact, testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.507" offset="7801581">And this was not before the magistrate who heard the case with consent of the parties when she directed the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.333" offset="7824882">And if one looks at the paragraph in question, it does not mention smoking as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.717" offset="7846407">What it talks about is considering various factors, including the personal desires of the inmate, quote unquote, which are taken into account, insofar as practical, in deciding who rooms with whom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.232" offset="7896458">Now, the policy in question that took effect... well, let... to go chronologically, the pretrial stipulation under which this case was presented to the trial court and to the court of appeals states... and I'm quoting now from page 51 of the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.595" offset="7961973">Paragraph 8 at the top of the page states as a stipulation signed by the Deputy Attorney General of Nevada, who was handling the case, and I quote: There are no restrictions on smoking in the prison's housing units, classroom or library.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.134" offset="8028115">No restrictions in the housing units.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.498" offset="8037519">The official policy which was adopted subsequently, and which we first learned about when the solicitor general filed his brief, indicates three factors that I think are relevant here to the question of whether... of the state of the present controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.855" offset="8091018">First of all, smoking by inmates is now prohibited throughout the Nevada State Prison System during meetings, counselling sessions, or visits with a doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.632" offset="8130097">Secondly, no-smoking areas are explicitly created in common areas such as classrooms, libraries, the gym, chapels, dining areas, and the infirmary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.079" offset="8171893">And third, with respect to housing questions Nevada prison officials are now required expressly to make, and I quote, reasonable efforts, unquote, to accommodate nonsmokers and smokers alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.816" offset="8226855">And if a nonsmoker such as Mr. McKinney has to be double celled and if he asks for a nonsmoking cellmates, the rules require, and I quote, accommodations will be made as necessary consistent with security considerations and space availability, unquote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.199" offset="8292370">So this... this is the rule that's now in effect, and has been since 1989.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.840" offset="8310864">As I mentioned a moment ago, we and the solicitor general assumed that this was a 1992 policy, but as the State points out in its reply brief, in fact it took place on October 1st, 1989.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.398" offset="8357153">The relevant copies, which change only minor... in minor details from year to year, have been lodged with the clerk and--</text>

            <text syncTime="2081.168" offset="8472197">In our view, if those standards are followed in the prison system, and I... we submit that it would be very difficult for a prisoner to challenge the conditions of confinement to satisfy the subjective prong if the prison official is saying we're doing all that we can consistent with the considerations, with balancing of the interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.632" offset="8554117">Then I think under Wilson v. Seiter it would be very difficult for a prisoner to say you are being deliberately indifferent, you are not demonstrating the requisite subjective intent that it needed for an Eighth Amendment violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2566.313" offset="10412781">The court of appeals decided quite explicitly, and this is at pages... see 38 and 39 of the Joint Appendix, that there was no deliberate indifference as to the present conditions in which Mr. McKinney was being confined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.425" offset="10469206">But because there was no evidence in the record at trial as to the future conditions, the finding of deliberate indifference does not extend to the second claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.049" offset="10507762">And I would point out, as we noted at pages 16 and 17 of our brief, the United States and all the State amici agree with us, that the subjective element which underlies deliberate indifference did not come into play here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2959.403" offset="11985143">So the way I would answer it is let's look at asbestos.</text>

            <text syncTime="3050.615" offset="12350022">Similarly... but on the other hand if the condition involved his exposure after a month or several weeks or a year, that might be a situation where there was an injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3090.860" offset="12510936">But let me talk also more specifically about that, because I think analytically the question of whether exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can, at some level, rise to an objective Eighth Amendment violation really has two subclass... subparts to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.049" offset="12567779">The first is whether, at a general level or as a general proposition, exposure to a hazard which does not manifest itself immediately but is... poses an unreasonable risk of a serious harm at some future point is covered by the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.339" offset="12628905">That's the position that the State takes in this case, although the solicitor general, at least, does not go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.903" offset="12651161">And let me give an example of what accepting that argument would mean, and then I will suggest that this Court has not gone that far in its opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.958" offset="12683344">Under the State's formulation in this case, let us suppose that prisoners in a prison system were given shots using the same needle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.573" offset="12717826">They had to share a needle, a flu shot or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.767" offset="12726603">And let's suppose that some of the inmates sharing that needle were HIV positive and let's suppose that that would have the effect of exposing some unexposed prisoners to be getting the AIDS virus and dying a rather slow and painful death somewhere down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.585" offset="12789924">Under that scenario the State posits that that is not cruel and unusual punishment to expose people to that risk, that the Eighth Amendment only applies if death or serious injury is... is instantaneous or imminent, and it does not cover those types of situations down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.287" offset="12856693">I think that argument is foreclosed, at least implicitly, by decisions of this Court such as Hutto v. Finney and Rhodes v. Chapman, particularly Rhodes where the Court cited with approval a number of lower court decisions which also involved threats of... of imminent danger where it was not clear that somebody would be... would be injured.</text>

            <text syncTime="3205.614" offset="12969960">And I assume any parent who... who used the same needle for a series of injections to various children would be subject to some... some legal sanction for that kind of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.135" offset="13024086">But, once again, I think if the doctor has a... does not have a nonsmoking waiting room or if the parents smoke despite the fact that they have children, we do not consider that contrary to current standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="3454.739" offset="13966479">The EPA pointed to lung cancer, an extremely serious, often fatal situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3508.946" offset="14183295">And to put that in context, 1 in 1,000 doesn't sound like much, but it is a level which this Court, in the benzene case, said entitles OSHA to regulate risks on the grounds that they are significant, and OSHA has, in fact, regulated product... exposure in the workplace to products such as formaldehyde or ethylene oxide.</text>

            <text syncTime="3552.405" offset="14357166">And it was held that there was cruel... there was an Eight Amendment violation stated if prison inmates were out working in the fields under... with exposure to pesticides that was not comparable to those of private employees with the same standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.722" offset="14410456">So it... it may be, but in this case if we're comparing risks and comparing... I'm putting it in context... EPA and FDA will regulate risks if the chance of death from lung cancer is as low as 1 in 100,000 or 1 in a million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.980" offset="14463432">Also, the other serious injury, you know, which again has not been identified with child abuse, is death by lung cancer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.837" offset="14494884">The Journal of the American Medical Association has indicated that the chance of death is as high as 1 in 100, based on exposure to cigarette smoke among people who never smoke.</text>
