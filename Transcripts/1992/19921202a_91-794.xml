            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="141647">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 91-794, Henry Harper v. Virginia Department of Taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.747" offset="180622">Mr. Kator.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_j_kator" startTime="10.747" stopTime="354.890">
            <label>Mr. Michael J. Kator</label>
            <text syncTime="10.747" offset="184592">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.449" offset="199430">This cases arises as the sequel to Davis v. Michigan Department of the Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.368" offset="223045">Petitioners are Federal retirees who, relying on Davis, sought refunds of the taxes Virginia unconstitutionally imposed on their pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.990" offset="261601">The court below denied petitioners their refunds, principally holding that Davis was not to be applied retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.956" offset="289396">This case presents the question whether Davis must be applied retroactively, and if so whether the Department of Taxation must refund petitioners the taxes unconstitutionally imposed upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.717" offset="336416">In reaching its conclusion to apply Davis nonretroactively, the court below relied on its application of Chevron Oil v. Huson.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.322" offset="378839">Well, we submit that the lower court's Chevron analysis is flawed in every respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.599" offset="399946">More fundamentally we submit that the court below erred in even reaching Chevron.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.631" offset="416142">Foremost, retroactivity of Davis is compelled by this Court's decision in Beam v. Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.847" offset="444981">In Beam this Court rejected modified or selective prospectivity in the civil arena.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.219" offset="466506">It held that if this Court applies its rule to the parties before it in one case all other courts must similarly apply that rule to litigants before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.638" offset="504122">Thus for choice of law purposes the dispositive question here is whether the Court applied its ruling to the parties in Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.947" offset="537350">On this point there can be no real dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.367" offset="551038">As a result of this Court's holding Michigan paid and Paul Davis received a refund of the taxes unconstitutionally imposed on his pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.786" offset="584788">It is not important how or why this Court reached that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.299" offset="602760">It matters only under Beam that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.532" offset="615717">Accordingly, under Beam, the court below was required to apply Davis retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.341" offset="646960">The second point that we raise is our statutory point.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.465" offset="667440">What the Department of Taxation is asking the Court to do in this case is something that it has never done before.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.758" offset="696592">It is asking the Court to use Chevron to ignore the plain, unambiguous terms of a lawfully enacted act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.036" offset="733791">This is not anything that any of the authorities that the Department of Taxation has cited in its brief suggests that this Court has ever done.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.420" offset="791260">And admitted, it would seem to me that there's no precedent which would support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.574" offset="815920">In enacting the Public Salary Tax Act in 1939 Congress said taxes imposed after December 31, 1938 must be non-discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.585" offset="863985">50 years later Virginia says no, that statute should go into effect December 31, 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.816" offset="896899">This Court cannot accept Virginia's equitable plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.953" offset="917379">They say it's going to be very burdensome for us to comply with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.078" offset="937859">Congress has spoken, and that, according to this Court's precedent, is the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.371" offset="967116">In our briefs we speak at great detail about the Chevron analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.195" offset="1002329">We address the bounds and propriety of prospectivity and we address the application of Chevron to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.864" offset="1037020">As this Court has most recently applied Chevron, it could not reach a case such as this, a case against a governmental entity where there is no contention that past precedent of this Court has been overruled and where there is no suggestion that this Court has answered a novel question of law in a revolutionary manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.638" offset="1108178">Application of Chevron in any event yields retroactive application of Davis as each element of that analysis favors retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.510" offset="1147675">For these reasons as well the court below erred in holding that Davis was nonretroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.788" offset="1172752">What I think is the tricky issue in this case is not so much the choice of law issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.754" offset="1200651">The more complicated issue is the remedy issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.533" offset="1215698">The court below offered two reasons for denying petitioners' refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.891" offset="1237118">Its first reason was that under Chevron Davis didn't need to be applied retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.950" offset="1261360">And that I submit is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.433" offset="1275361">Its second reason was that under its own state law analysis, its own state law retroactivity analysis, Davis would not be applied retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.789" offset="1316739">As this Court made clear in Ashland Oil, in Beam, and the various opinions in the American Trucking Association v. Smith, the question of retroactivity of a decision of this Court is a question of Federal law, not state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.048" offset="1381836">The Virginia Supreme Court was simply wrong in holding that as a matter of state law you could deny retroactive effect to Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.497" offset="1423632">The second thing that the Supreme Court of Virginia did in its second opinion was it suggested that no remedy was required here even if Davis is retroactive because it can continue to consider the remedial, or the equitable considerations of Chevron in the remedial calculus.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.205" offset="1522375">It can say even if the law is unconstitutional, the statute is unconstitutional as declared by Davis, nonetheless it can deny relief.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="354.890" offset="1561141">Well certainly the state can, in a tax case the state can require a claimant to go through the procedures required of other claimants for tax refunds, can it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_j_kator" startTime="366.197" stopTime="441.026">
            <label>Mr. Michael J. Kator</label>
            <text syncTime="366.197" offset="1606385">Certainly a state can structure its tax refund statute in a way that provides it protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.224" offset="1638463">Certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.552" offset="1639822">That's not what we have here in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.520" offset="1655704">The bottom line, as McKesson makes clear, is a clear and certain remedy for the unlawful deprivation of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.049" offset="1689768">That's what we had in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.937" offset="1697291">Virginia seems to suggest that McKesson only applies in the situation where it's foreseeable at the time that the statute was enacted that the statute would be challenged and likely invalidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.259" offset="1766672">And I submit that McKesson cannot be so limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.726" offset="1780465">McKesson speaks in terms of constitutional due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.599" offset="1791959">The due process clause doesn't say you get due, due process may not be taken in bad faith without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.754" offset="1824560">It says property may not be taken without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.955" offset="1841383">Their reading of McKesson is far too parsimonious.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.125" offset="1858101">In this case Virginia must provide a clear and certain remedy, and their statute presumably does so.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.372" offset="1887045">If it doesn't, then the Constitution requires that a remedy be provided.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="441.026" offset="1905748">Well, and I suppose the state can also put a time bar on the remedy, that you must apply for a refund or pay under protest within a certain amount of time or you can't do it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_j_kator" startTime="452.521" stopTime="477.323">
            <label>Mr. Michael J. Kator</label>
            <text syncTime="452.521" offset="1951724">Certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.865" offset="1953082">As this Court held in Beam and in McKesson, the states are allowed to erect procedural barriers, procedural protections around them to shield them from liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.734" offset="2004491">And that's what most states have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.765" offset="2012641">They have created a system whereby the statute of limitations, 3 years, whatever, within which to present claims, and that's the procedure the petitioners have followed in this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="477.323" stopTime="485.024">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="477.323" offset="2050885">What are the limits in Virginia, the statute of limitations or the time requirements on a tax claim?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_j_kator" startTime="485.024" stopTime="526.210">
            <label>Mr. Michael J. Kator</label>
            <text syncTime="485.024" offset="2081709">In an ordinary case it would be 3 years as a general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.974" offset="2097487">It's 3 years or I believe 60 days after your Federal return is corrected in a Federal claim, piggy-backs it in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.378" offset="2131133">In this particular case, shortly after Davis was decided by this Court the Virginia legislature met and amended its refund statute for the explicit purpose of allowing Federal, the claims of Federal, retroactivity of Davis to be resolved, it amended the refund statute to say claims for refunds for Davis type taxes may be submitted up to a year after final resolution of the retroactivity of Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.461" offset="2231443">So in Virginia the door is still open.</text>

            <text syncTime="526.210" offset="2246385">You are only extending it to a year after this Court renders a decision in this case?</text>

            <text syncTime="531.568" offset="2267910">Well, perhaps this Court, perhaps the Supreme Court of Virginia on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.394" offset="2279195">It's a little unclear, but the door is still open in Virginia.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael J. Kator</label>
            <text syncTime="540.174" offset="2302287">Only to 1984 would be the first... I'm sorry, 1985 would be the first tax year at issue, in dispute in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.890" offset="2329141">Most of the petitioners filed their refund claims in March, April of 1989, and that would have entitled them to go back to 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.368" offset="2383058">So the tax years in dispute are '85, '86, '87, and '88.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.616" offset="2404060">Virginia didn't impose the tax in '89.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="568.052" offset="2413778">I'm a little puzzled because they make the argument in their brief that as long as you had a prepayment procedure you don't have to have a host payment refund claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.782" offset="2460694">That seems a little inconsistent with what you've just said.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.500" offset="2471560">Is it... you think it's perfectly clear as a matter of Virginia law that... have they already decided that there is a remedy in this case?</text>

            <text syncTime="589.825" offset="2500922">In this case all the court has held is that the reason its refund statute does not apply is because of non-retroactivity of Davis.</text>

            <text syncTime="601.538" offset="2547734">In its second opinion it intimated that it could continue to play the Chevron game with respect to a remedy, but that's not anything that it had done before.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.863" offset="2593082">We also challenge the assertion that there's any meaningful predeprivation remedy in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.688" offset="2624325">In Virginia the predeprivation remedy is essentially to go to the tax commissioner and say I don't think I should have to pay these taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.794" offset="2660791">In order to get judicial review of that determination by the tax commissioner you must pay the taxes and you are funnelled into the same refund procedure that we filed, the petitioners filed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.303" offset="2714813">So because this case involves constitutionality of the Virginia statute, the Virginia tax commissioner has no authority to say the tax is unconstitutional to absolve petitioners from paying that tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.423" offset="2771237">Therefore there is no meaningful predeprivation remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="678.336" offset="2854934">And what the argument seems to be is that well, you had this other route you could have taken and therefore we can cut off the route that you happened to choose to take.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.579" offset="6623880">If I may suggest, for example, this Court could find that Davis is prospective, and if it finds that for whatever reason this case is over because there are no other legal issues for the Court to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.839" offset="6676961">If, however, this Court finds that it is not prospective, we submit that you could still and should still affirm the decision of the Virginia Supreme Court below because the Virginia Supreme Court not only determined under Chevron that it was prospective and therefore not an erroneous or improper exaction of tax, which is what 1826 requires, but it also had another leg to its opinion in which it said that under 1826 and under our precedents, Perkins and Capehart, we look in those cases to the reliance of the parties and the factors of the administration of justice in determining whether or not our particular statutory state remedy encompasses the facts that you petitioners have chosen to bring before us and that you have, the route you have chosen to take.</text>

            <text syncTime="1690.301" offset="6902764">Ms. Marshall, did Perkins and Capehart make clear and did you argue in this case at the trial court that the rule is different for post-payment remedies than it is for the declaratory judgment remedy?</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.138" offset="6974130">I mean, if I read Perkins and Capehart I would think that that applies to all remedies from the Virginia Supreme Court for taxes, whether you do it before or after.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.197" offset="7010388">You're arguing now though a very sophisticated and subtle distinction between post-payment remedies and prepayment remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.882" offset="7041108">Is that clear in Perkins and Capehart, that had you come earlier we wouldn't play this equitable game, but as it is you have come late and we have a different rule for post-payment cases?</text>

            <label>Ms. Gail Starling Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="1735.689" offset="7084367">Let me suggest, Your Honor, that I believe it is clearly derived from Perkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.547" offset="7099831">Perkins was a prepayment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.312" offset="7110803">It was a declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.295" offset="7118744">And it received the relief of the court from what was determined to be an erroneous assessment methodology used by, widespread.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.636" offset="7156151">Similar here where this is used in 23 states, that was used in many counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.526" offset="7171720">Capehart came later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.899" offset="7181229">Capehart paid the tax and then asked for the refund, and Capehart's refund claim was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.802" offset="7212785">So I suggest that the prepayment/post-payment is really intrinsically in those two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.267" offset="7234623">But whether you say have we litigated a lot of cases in that area, no, Your Honor, we have not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.954" offset="7253431">But I suggest to Your Honor for several reasons that whether you find Davis to be retroactive or not, the Supreme Court of Virginia should be affirmed because what Virginia has done in the second part of its opinion is it looked to its state law remedy and it has defined the scope even-handedly and based on precedent that is 2 decades old.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.616" offset="7344024">It has defined the scope of that remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.741" offset="7352592">And only, I would suggest, if this Court finds that there is not, as we argue there is, a procedural bar to these further Federal constitutional questions such as due process, only if you find that that procedural bar does not exist in this case would you be correct in remanding this for the court below to consider those due process issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.888" offset="7445170">Petitioners have argued that the due process issues were argued to the Virginia Supreme Court in their reply brief at the supreme court stage, but we argue there is a state procedural bar and certainly putting it in your reply brief is not a proper way of preserving the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.537" offset="7515701">The assignments of error under Virginia law clearly state what issues are waived and which ones are not waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.690" offset="7544331">Speaking of McKesson, I'd like to mention also that in McKesson not only did they violate clearly established law at the time of the enactment and the collection of the tax, but they protested the tax ahead of time, as these people had the option to do, not the requirement to do but the option to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.011" offset="7621654">These people never came forward and raised their hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.134" offset="7634088">Also in McKesson, their complaint was based on two alternative grounds or theories of recovery, state law refund and directly on the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.536" offset="7675779">That is not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.802" offset="7684765">These petitioners have chosen to put all of their eggs into one basket, and that is into the basket of the State Refund Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2158.034" offset="8773758">I would like to suggest that it's very important for the Court, whatever lens it sees this case through, to focus on and to look at the reliance interest and the settled expectations of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.669" offset="8832272">It's also important to look at the nature of the harm alleged.</text>

            <text syncTime="2181.666" offset="8868217">This is not a case, we suggest, where there was any over-reaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.367" offset="8883054">Virginia was not pushing the envelope in any way of valid taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.318" offset="8902907">It turned out that it was in fatal collision, unknown to it and unknown to these petitioners who never came forward and raised their hands and said there was a problem until after this Court's decision in March of 1989.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.516" offset="8951704">But it was certainly reasonable both for the petitioners and the 23 states who have, as you know, a massive refund liability on this case of approximately $1.8 billion, it was reasonable for those states to believe that they had a legitimate purpose to give benefits to their own former state retirees, former state employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.991" offset="9045536">This was a legitimate purpose and the fact that they had done it through an indirect benefit of taxes rather than through a direct cash benefit did not appear, and reasonably so, to be of any legal significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.986" offset="9093497">What Virginia did was it exempted its state retirees, there are approximately 60,000 of those today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.671" offset="9124321">Then it taxed the entire individual taxpaying public identically, $2.56 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.168" offset="9162251">Fewer than 10 percent of that are represented by the Federal retirees here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.822" offset="9180850">In other words Virginia's state retirees are outnumbered by citizens and voters who are Federal retirees by about 3 to 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.990" offset="9213556">When you look at that number and you also consider, which is in the record and the affidavit and the legislative history, the disparity between the general size of Federal retirement income and the size of state retirement income you can do a rough estimate of what the value was of the benefit now found to be offending under Davis, and we don't dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.106" offset="9302058">We quickly changed our law immediately to conform with Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.041" offset="9317732">But that value of the benefit given during the 4 years in issue here is approximately $8 million to $12 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.040" offset="9349706">Now we suggest that the penalty here that is being requested or demanded of a 100 percent refund, which for Virginia alone now is approximately $467 million, that no Federal interest requires that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.469" offset="9411459">There is no Federal interest or underpinning in the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine that would lead to that inequitable result.</text>

            <text syncTime="3189.166" offset="12898284">The issue that is raised here was raised for the first time by the attorney general in the Supreme Court of Virginia, and that was a point that we raised in our reply briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.833" offset="12940916">We said why are you raising this point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.145" offset="12946140">And the reason they were raising that point there, and then at that time, was because that was after the Supreme Court of South Carolina in its Bass case said wait, we've got a better idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.016" offset="12989608">We'll change our refund statute and say it doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.983" offset="13001520">And that's exactly what Virginia, the attorney general is trying to convince its court to do, and to its credit the Supreme Court of Virginia has not at least yet gone and changed its refund statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.838" offset="13044987">Another point that I think bears emphasis, if it were so clear and certain that petitioners had no remedy under the refund statute, why did the Virginia General Assembly amend the statute to extend the statute of limitations for petitioners to file their claims solely and expressly for the purpose of allowing retroactivity of Davis to be resolved?</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.283" offset="13130774">Certainly the legislature of Virginia thought the refund statute applied, and perhaps in retrospect maybe Virginia is right, it didn't apply it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.389" offset="13167136">But it must now because the supreme, the legislature of Virginia has amended it to say so.</text>

            <text syncTime="3290.063" offset="13301823">And then in Capehart, when somebody else in another county tried to do it, the Supreme Court of Virginia said no, we said in Perkins prospective only and that's what we meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.435" offset="13339335">The Supreme Court of Virginia in this case, and this is at 15(a) of the cert petition, says Harper's state law contention also fails for another reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.773" offset="13380713">We previously have held that this court's ruling declaring a taxing scheme unconstitutional is to be applied prospectively only.</text>

            <text syncTime="3461.259" offset="13986649">Correct, Your Honor, and my point is I don't think that it is, it can be seen from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.616" offset="14004099">I think it also bears emphasis that when this case was originally brought in the Eastern District of Virginia the Virginia Attorney General pled the existence of the refund statute as a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.470" offset="14055508">And I don't think the significance of that should be lost on the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.469" offset="14067420">The bottom line as we see it, Your Honor, is McKesson's requirement for a clear and certain remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.108" offset="14089990">I don't think there's any real dispute that Davis must be applied retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.029" offset="14109738">That being so, there must be a clear and certain remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.729" offset="14124471">What we ask this Court to do is no more than say that it meant what it said in Davis, that it meant what it said in Beam, and that it meant what it said in McKesson, and on that basis to reverse the decision below.</text>

            <text syncTime="3507.364" offset="14171074">May I ask you one last question before you... the second part of the Virginia Supreme Court opinion seems to me to be responding to this argument that you made, and tell me if I am right on your presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.829" offset="14216945">Did you argue that even if it's not retroactive as a matter of Federal law it is in any event retroactive as a matter of state law, and they said no to that?</text>

            <text syncTime="3526.795" offset="14248814">The argument was, my argument was your refund statute says erroneous and illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.229" offset="14278489">That's the legislature's conclusion of how it wants to gauge this, and therefore you can't play the retroactivity game.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.930" offset="14305343">This is essentially the argument that was accepted by the Supreme Court of Missouri in Hackman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.630" offset="14324151">In rejecting that the Supreme Court of Virginia said no, the retroactivity of Davis comes first and therefore, because we find that Davis is not retroactive, it's not erroneous or illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.968" offset="14381516">And moreover, just so you know, we have done this before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.670" offset="14396249">That's essentially what their state law holding was.</text>
