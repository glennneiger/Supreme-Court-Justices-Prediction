            <text syncTime="11.399" offset="181058">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.612" offset="193910">This case involves exemption 7(D) of the Freedom of Information Act, which permits the FBI and other Federal law enforcement agencies to protect the identities of confidential sources and also, in the case of criminal law investigations, the information provided by those sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.683" offset="266217">The specific question presented here is what exactly the FBI must do in district court to establish that a particular source may be treated as a confidential one.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.960" offset="303311">Seven of the U.S. circuit courts of appeals have adopted the approach that we urge on the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.926" offset="331105">That is, to allow the FBI to carry its burden by means of a categorical showing in which the FBI shows that each of the documents at issue falls within a category of sources... for example, State and local law enforcement agencies, for which an assurance of confidentiality is inherently implicit in the normal course of events.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.111" offset="427862">On the other hand, the court of appeals in the present case has set down a rigid rule that the FBI cannot invoke exemption 7(D) unless it can provide</text>
            <text syncTime="83.157" offset="468091">"detailed explanations relating to each alleged confidential source. "</text>
            <text syncTime="87.611" offset="485854">We submit that the FBI should indeed be able to proceed on the basis of a categorical showing presuming confidentiality for these types of sources in the absence of an indication otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.808" offset="538726">There are two essential reasons--</text>

            <text syncTime="106.271" offset="560564">--The categories are indeed broad, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.444" offset="569237">For example, in this case the FBI has contended that the individuals who provide information to the FBI in the course of a criminal investigation normally do so with an inherent understanding, an implied understanding of confidentiality.</text>

            <text syncTime="123.555" offset="629632">So your contention is that it should be enough to invoke exemption 7 if the FBI shows that the statement made by a particular individual was made to an FBI agent investigating a crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.898" offset="839030">When the law enforcement agencies and the FBI exchange information, there is a tacit understanding, which I believe the declaration in the present case said, for example, is reinforced in the daily contacts that FBI special agents have with local law enforcement agencies.</text>

            <text syncTime="209.131" offset="971941">--Well, I think, Justice O'Connor, what's important is not necessarily the subjective expectation of each individual, and the problem, as we've pointed out, is that to base the rule on the content of the information raises very problematic issues, because certainly when people are contacted, they... what they know for sure is they're talking to an FBI agent about a matter of criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.414" offset="1061071">That's the entire premise for our presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.616" offset="1073923">An individual, or even a local police department, may not necessarily know what information will be particularly salient, and certainly in many investigations... after all, the present one involves the murder of a police officer.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="250.598" offset="1137871">Well, perhaps the circumstances of a particular investigation would certainly justify the assumption in some cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.781" offset="1166605">For instance, a witness of a gang-related killing or something, I think most people would think those circumstances would give rise to a presumption of constitutionality, but I'm not sure it applies across the board.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.213" offset="1232329">--Well, I think the important point, Justice O'Connor, is that we need a starting point for this analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.937" offset="1255213">The problem, as we point out, both in terms of the statutory language and the underlying policies of exemption 7(D) is that you need a realistic starting point because, if one has to rely on the content of the information, of the particular crime that's at stake, the protection that's going to be provided is going to be very unreliable, and that's one of the keys to this case, I think.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.622" offset="1353956">Well, I mean if you can determine from the particular circumstances that there is a likelihood of the presumption of confidentiality, that's one thing, but I wonder if it should be applied across the board?</text>

            <text syncTime="330.478" offset="1457400">That very fact is very important, because the FBI has a decades-long tradition of maintaining the confidentiality of its records.</text>

            <text syncTime="361.539" offset="1581639">We would submit that Congress hasn't imposed such a requirement on the FBI, and that in itself would be a very dramatic departure from the way the FBI is doing business now, and on a practical level as well, this... the respondent has tried to characterize our position as something new, some change.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.242" offset="1656453">In fact, this is the way the FBI has been proceeding throughout the history of exemption 7(D) since it was enacted in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.376" offset="1684979">Even if one were to say that oh, the FBI could change the way it does business in the future, (a) that in itself would be a change that should come from Congress and not the courts, and (b) that would do nothing for the enormous storehouse of information which exists right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.215" offset="1744329">I mean, if the Court were to say, well, it's all well and good, but the FBI has to show us specific circumstances, for most of what's there it simply doesn't exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="1052.891" offset="4346961">You would say, well, the confidentiality at least extends beyond that point which came out in testimony, so you would have an easy way of applying your criterion that there are degrees of confidentiality, and that degree would be determined by the extent to which the confidentiality was invaded by public testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="1072.924" offset="4427105">Yes, but far more typically this issue is raised by plaintiffs saying hypothetically someone might testify, or might think that they might have to testify, and therefore there's no confidentiality, and that, we think, is simply not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.131" offset="4476006">The problem is that on a practical level the proof that would necessarily be needed under the court of appeals ruling usually isn't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.130" offset="4515921">What we have is the fact that someone provided information to the FBI, we know that it was in the course of a criminal investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.675" offset="4542148">We think that the proper starting point is that there is an implied assurance of confidentiality in that sort of encounter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.770" offset="4570569">And I'd also remind the court that I think the language of the statute itself gives us a very important point here, and that particularly involves the 1986 amendment to exemption 7(D).</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.117" offset="4611947">Prior to that time, the FBI would have to show that the release of a record at issue would result in the disclosure of a confidential source, or information from a confidential source.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.264" offset="4660535">Congress changed that in 1986 to say that we need only show that the release could reasonably be expected to have such a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.562" offset="4701704">4 years ago in a Reporters Committee, this Court recognized the significance of that language, and in particular its relationship to the notion that the Government may frequently make its showing by means of categorical showings and not by item-by-item, or as in this case, source-by-source showings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.742" offset="4766383">Think, for example, of what is, I'm afraid, a typical document in question, an FBI interview report with a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.056" offset="4799716">That report may begin that special agent Mary Jones spoke to John Smith of 123 Main Street on February 24th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.274" offset="4840571">Smith related the following information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.004" offset="4847467">And the document may then go on to give the information, giving nothing about the circumstances of the interview, but also giving nothing that would indicate that the normal presumption of confidentiality shouldn't apply, and the question is, what is the FBI to do with that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.627" offset="4913923">Certainly we seem not to be able to meet the court of appeals test requiring specific circumstances regarding the interview, but as a practical starting point we submit that, yes, based on common sense and based on the FBI's tradition of confidentiality there should be the starting point that should be used by both the FBI and a reviewing court that yes, there is an implication of confidentiality there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.426" offset="7185113">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.410" offset="7201100">The FBI offers essentially three arguments in support of its nearly irrebuttable presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.644" offset="7226073">One is its claim that as a factual matter the FBI's presumption mirrors the relationship between itself as an agency and its sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.611" offset="7265884">That is, what my adversary just said holds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.432" offset="7281139">In the context of a criminal investigation, sources expect confidentiality, typically, and typically the FBI assures it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.827" offset="7310710">I call that the setting argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.009" offset="7319487">The second argument is a pragmatic argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1798.820" offset="7330772">The setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.571" offset="7333698">That is, in the setting of a criminal investigation, confidentiality is inherent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.625" offset="7353969">The second argument is that... is what I'm calling a pragmatic argument, which is that the FBI... that if the presumption that the FBI seeks here today is not granted there will be some sort of administrative or adjudicative havoc, that the FBI is not prepared to come forward with case-specific proofs in the event this Court affirms the Third Circuit, that the FBI doesn't maintain records of confidentiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.672" offset="7462116">Even though confidentiality is so important, the FBI tells us, they maintain no records, so that an agent in 1952 doesn't know whether in 1946 a source was assured confidentiality... no records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.582" offset="7521779">Third is a textual claim that the 1986 amendments and their history provide a statutory basis for the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.846" offset="7554798">This argument is somewhat of a moving target.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.509" offset="7565456">In their reply brief the FBI seems to shift from the affirmative posture of its main brief that the 1986 language provides a textual basis for its presumption to a claim... a more cautious claim that FOIA simply doesn't preclude a presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.480" offset="7629404">The FBI's claim that in the setting of a criminal investigation virtually all witnesses typically require confidentiality doesn't ring true in the context, for example, of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.598" offset="7681858">Before the criminal trial of the matter underlying this case, numerous FBI investigative reports prepared by the FBI were turned over to my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.027" offset="7727520">I was not the trial lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.175" offset="7732117">In those discovery documents, the names of 41 law enforcement personnel were revealed, 31 witnesses were revealed by name, and 16 of them by address.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.424" offset="7781123">The fact that some of these witnesses testified at trial appears in press clippings in the disclosures that the FBI made to me.</text>

            <text syncTime="2466.836" offset="10002785">Is it possible that the FBI, in the face of an unsettled body of law, took the most aggressive approach and said we'll follow the majority rule even before it was a majority rule and didn't keep records in the event this Court should some day resolve this unsettled body of law by saying no, this presumption has no basis in this statute, this presumption has no factual basis?</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.103" offset="10103827">That proposition is not worthy of credence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3109.756" offset="12574488">That won't exist if this issue winds up being decided on an ad hoc basis by judges who are frequently approaching the issue years after the fact, if we have to rely on showing the physical circumstances such as whether the door was shut or not, and also if we have to rely on the content of the information, if we have to say district judges saying, well, a murder investigation is sensitive, but some other Federal crimes and Federal criminal...
