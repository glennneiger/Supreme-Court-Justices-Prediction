            <text syncTime="202.539" offset="935230">But I would not make the concession that there is an actual facial vagueness problem with it because we believe that the term utter disregard for human life has the kind of content that makes it possible to distinguish this kind of case from a larger universe of lesser murders.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.186" offset="1629774">And I think that if you look at the cases that the state supreme court has decided and the cases that have gone before the trial courts, what you find is that the cold-blooded factor encompasses a very small number of cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="459.006" offset="1961111">That of course is not the end of the line in our judicial sentencing system because the state supreme court conducts a full course of independent review of all death sentences.</text>

            <text syncTime="611.518" offset="2571123">Now, what the trial judge focused on, among other things I think, was the nature of the particularly indifferent or cold-blooded action of the defendant in stomping this individual to death after he was down on the floor--</text>

            <text syncTime="672.187" offset="2813852">He said that there was an excessive violent rage, but he seems to have been describing the nature of the killing and not the original motivation of the defendant for setting things up in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.447" offset="2866829">I think that is the key factor here when you look at the cold-bloodedness of the defendant's behavior, and that is something that the trial judge did not entirely explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.670" offset="2915730">But that ambiguity I think is resolved when the state supreme court in the course of its independent review function says that it has never seen in 50 years of examining comparable cases a more remorseless, cold-blooded or calculating killer than this individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="820.746" offset="3408086">We think that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals did not accurately or fully apply this Court's precedent in Walton v. Arizona which has two important components.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.256" offset="3458137">One of them is that a judicial sentencing system such as we have is entitled to some more deference than other kinds of sentencing systems, and that the Godfrey-Maynard rationale does not fully apply in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.182" offset="3525846">If you assume that the trial court and the state supreme court knew the law in this case, knew the requirements of the Constitution and applied it, you have to reach the conclusion that in this process Idaho's courts applied the narrowest possible construction of the utter disregard factor to the circumstances of the case rather than the broadest possible factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.535" offset="3635247">In Walton and in some of the other cases involving the analogous especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel factor the courts were trying to define a word like heinousness, which is much broader and less specific and much more difficult to deal with in a sentencing situation than the term cold-blooded.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.865" offset="3720510">Cold-blooded talks about a state of mind, and there are lots of circumstances in which courts have to deal with state of mind descriptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.054" offset="3753320">There are circumstances such as arise when it's necessary to determine what is premeditated and what does it mean, or what is malice of forethought and what does it mean, what is reckless disregard and what does it mean.</text>

            <text syncTime="1949.157" offset="7921732">I think there are some subjective factors that in fact can properly limit the sentencer's discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.342" offset="7938450">The problem with cold-blooded as one of them is that it is an umbrella term which incorporates several very different concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.146" offset="7961647">In fact I think some of the Court's questions earlier today indicate that very problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.300" offset="7982231">Let me illustrate if I can with what I believe some of those different definitions are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.636" offset="8003652">In 1983 when this case was first argued to the Idaho Supreme Court the attorney general of Idaho defending the utter disregard factor in this case said that it applied to defendants who lacked the moral restraints against killing, lacked the moral precepts against killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.665" offset="8075750">That was how it was defended in 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.950" offset="8088915">The case came into Federal court and before this Court and it's now defined as a killing without emotion, without significant provocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.140" offset="8121621">Now there is a significant shift.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.406" offset="8126741">Those are two very different definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.842" offset="8136458">In Florida, of course as we know from the attorney general's briefing and from all the briefing in the case, the coldness factor is defined as something that we call super premeditation, which is yet another way to describe coldness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.934" offset="8192778">And so we see in this case that that, I think, is the fundamental problem with using a term like cold-blooded, not merely that it is subjective, but that it is an umbrella term that can refer to many different concepts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2038.281" offset="8278146">Is there anything that says the limiting, each limiting factor must be limited to one single thing?</text>

            <text syncTime="2059.128" offset="8361529">The problem, however, is that when none of them or even all of them haven't been identified, then the, there's a real practical side to the problem which is when you come into court in Idaho and you have this umbrella-like definition which contains three or four different possibilities, the parties, the defendant and the prosecutor and indeed the trial court who is the sentencer in Idaho, doesn't know which of the definitions to use, if any, or all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.246" offset="8466019">And so the problem is that you may have one trial judge applying the super premeditation factor, the parties present their evidence and the trial court either finds utter disregard or finds no utter disregard based on super premeditation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2589.345" offset="10482463">Lewis of course suggested that once a limiting definition is proposed by the state and if it's a valid limiting definition you can't look at actually how it's applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.451" offset="10526871">That simply falls under the third part, the Jackson v. Virginia, whether a rational fact finder could reach the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.557" offset="10555292">I think, however, there is a tension between that aspect of Lewis and Sochor v. Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.877" offset="10576608">In Sochor v. Florida this Court recognized that in a judge sentencing state if the limiting definition is not quite up to snuff you can in fact look at applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.852" offset="10624465">That was a case out of Florida where the limiting definition that this Court had approved had not been in fact used by Florida and this Court looked at how it was applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="2646.782" offset="10712236">I think under Sochor v. Florida it is, and certainly in a judge sentencing case it should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.186" offset="10733865">Trial courts are presumed to be aware not only of the articulated principles that come down in cases, but I assume of the applications in those very cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.358" offset="10766466">So I think it makes sense that in a judge sentencing case, as Idaho is, that the cases applying the limiting definition should be considered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2716.675" offset="10991746">The reason, the more I suppose theoretical reason why I think it's proper in a judge sentencing case or a judge sentencing state to look at the applications is because the court is presumed, the trial courts are presumed to be aware of those applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.019" offset="11049111">So it has at least to me some intrinsic sense to look at those applications to see what a trial judge sitting in the day-to-day rigors of his practice, or of judging, is going to be aware of.</text>
