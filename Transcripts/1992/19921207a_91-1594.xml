            <text syncTime="29.381" offset="247965">This case involves one specific narrow prohibition by Florida of the conduct of Florida licensed certified public accountants.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.697" offset="289238">It is a prohibition imposed by the legislature by statute, and by the State Board of Accountancy which licenses CPA's by rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.704" offset="333333">The prohibition is of cold call solicitation of new clients... what the statute and the rule called direct, in-person, uninvited solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.891" offset="382025">The conduct is one defined as solicitation which directly or implicitly requests an immediate oral response from the recipient.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.750" offset="425493">We're not her... involved, of course, with political speech or artistic speech, we are involved with the most blatant of commercial speech implemented through conduct of the most confrontational.</text>

            <text syncTime="93.854" offset="505845">Would it also be prohibited... your rule also apply to a solicitation by an accountant who did not ask for an immediate response, if he just said I... went in and made the presentation and said, think it over and whenever you're interested, let me know?</text>

            <text syncTime="114.016" offset="586511">I believe, nevertheless, that what you have proposed would be barred because the presentation would be direct, in person, and uninvited.</text>

            <text syncTime="131.837" offset="657774">The reason I ask, it seems to me, judging from my practice as a lawyer, not as an accountant, in trying to put it in present-day terms, it seems to me if I were trying to get a client and had a presentation to make I wouldn't demand that the person make an immediate response.</text>

            <label>Mr. Parker D. Thomson</label>
            <text syncTime="248.643" offset="1125052">There are two basic reasons that go to the two basic purposes of the governance of certified public accountants in the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.333" offset="1175834">The statute with respect to certified public accountants says that the first purpose is to assure the accuracy of audit statements upon which the public relies, and the second is to protect the public from dishonest practitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.062" offset="1238737">Taking the latter one first, the communication made in this fashion is inherently unregulatable.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.248" offset="1271442">You simply do not know what was said, the circumstances, the tone, what-have-you, and therefore it is beyond the subject of regulation with respect to the first, which is, after all, the board's primary concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.565" offset="1324732">It is with the attest function, so-called, of CPA's.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.370" offset="1343958">That is, those activities that are associated with financial statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.992" offset="1362453">In performing that function, the CPA represents the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.746" offset="1381470">He has a public function, because the financial statements that he opines on will be used by the public, and the public assumes the accuracy of the financial statements because of the opinion and then relies on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.034" offset="1442596">That public could be clients themselves, it could be lenders, it could be the securities markets, it can be the persons who purchase and sell securities on the security markets, it can be Government regulatory agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.664" offset="1493169">It is in effect to sanitize that particular relationship which demands the independence... the nonadvocacy, but the independence of the certified public accountant that this prohibition is placed, and it is not merely the actual independence of the certified public accountant, it is the apparent independence.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.295" offset="1615631">It is that the public has faith and trust in that independence, whether in fact there has been any actual impairment of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2311.407" offset="9376089">I think if you look at our complaint, it is more clearly an as-applied challenge, because in our complaint, we specify precisely the conduct in which Mr. Fane seeks to engage, and we certainly pushed the district court towards issuing an order that was limited towards solicitation in the business context, or business clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.811" offset="9461666">And in that respect I think the complaint is very much like the kind of challenge that was described by this Court in Fox, which is a narrow tailoring challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.189" offset="9507223">That is, the kind of challenge that doesn't apply... doesn't seek to have the statute struck down as facially overbroad, but challenges one particular application to that statute, and here, it's for the kind of business solicitation that Mr. Fane seeks to engage in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.632" offset="9580993">We didn't label the complaint that way, Justice O'Connor, but I think that's the only fair reading of the complaint, and certainly that's the way it was treated by the district court judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2449.620" offset="9928944">That prohibition remained in force until 1948, when the AICPA sweepingly amended its rules to prohibit all kinds of promotional activity... advertising, solicitation and everything of the sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.721" offset="9989339">In 1973, the Justice Department Antitrust Division first contacted the AICPA to explain that it thought the rules were anticompetitive and violative of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.360" offset="10047958">Finally, in 1979, threatened with imminent litigation by the Justice Department, the AICPA withdrew its solicitation ban and issued a report called the Report on Solicitation, which is contained in the Joint Appendix, which takes the position that there is no evidence whatsoever that in-person solicitation by CPA's leads to either of the concerns the State claims to fear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.650" offset="10161016">That is, abuse of the attest function, or overreaching by CPA's who engage in solicitation, and the AICPA Report on Solicitation is really the only comprehensive or authoritative study on this issue uncovered by either party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.111" offset="10230920">In fact, it was submitted by the defendants in the district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2619.192" offset="10607187">Let me return, though, to the State's justifications here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.434" offset="10624219">The other point I'd make is, not only is there no evidence, but there is experience before other jurisdictions that shows that there have not been problems with solicitation activities by CPA's, nor has there been any evidence from Florida during the 2 years that this injunction has been in effect that there have been any problems with abusive solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.502" offset="10732471">The defendants never sought a stay of the district court's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.645" offset="10749085">Solicitation at least in the business context has therefore been permissible in Florida for the last 2 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.260" offset="10775520">There has been no suggestion at all that that has given rise to any problems or any difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.774" offset="10805614">I'd like to say briefly a word about the time-place-manner doctrine argument that the defendants have made as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.870" offset="10849917">We have explained in our brief why we do not believe the time-place-manner argument applies, and let me just highlight two of our most fundamental concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.847" offset="10889832">The first is, there's no question in our view that this is a content-based ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.641" offset="10913029">Like all restraints on commercial speech, the solicitation ban picks out the particular form of communication and regulates it, and this Court's jurisprudence has made clear that content-based regulations are not subject to review under the time-place-manner doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.662" offset="10989098">In the commercial speech area, we submit they are reviewable under the Central Hudson test which we believes govern, and indeed, all of this Court's prior cases involving lawyer advertising, professional advertising regulation, had been decided under the Central Hudson test, not under the time-place-manner doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.917" offset="11074152">The second point that we think is pertinent is that the defendant's argument really seems to make a fortress out of the dictionary by equating the word manner with mode.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.715" offset="11121277">Here, this regulation seeks to suppress an entire mode of communication, and this Court's opinions by and large have said that where the regulation completely prohibits a particular mode of expressive activity, it ought not to be judged under the time-place-manner standard.</text>
