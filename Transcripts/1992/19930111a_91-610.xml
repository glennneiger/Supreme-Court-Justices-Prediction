            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="127295">We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 91-610, Local 144 Nursing Home Pension Fund v. Nicholas Demisay.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.759" offset="178286">Mr. Rose.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="henry_rose" startTime="14.171" stopTime="263.603">
            <label>Mr. Henry Rose</label>
            <text syncTime="14.171" offset="183928">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="21.374" offset="212768">The genesis of this action occurred when the respondent employers withdrew from the petitioner multiemployer pension and welfare benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.442" offset="261042">In this action, those withdrawing employers seek to require the petitioner benefit funds to transfer a portion of their plan assets to new benefit plans which are not parties to this action which were established after the withdrawal of those withdrawing employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.447" offset="345052">The district court granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.381" offset="368771">However, the Second Circuit reversed and held that a fair portion of the reserves reflecting contributions made to the Greater Funds on behalf of the Southern Employees should be reallocated to the Southern Funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.433" offset="449019">What is extraordinary and erroneous is that the court below held that section 302(c)(5) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, was the controlling law and that it required the transfer of assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.527" offset="525401">302(c)(5) says nothing about transfers of assets, nor does its legislative history even mention such transfers.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.872" offset="566779">The court below has not only misread section 302(c)(5) but has misread and misapplied... failed to apply... this Court's decision in United Mineworkers v. Robinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.793" offset="630413">The focus of 302(c)(5) is specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.446" offset="649013">In the words of this Court in Robinson, 302(c)(5) was meant to protect employees from the risk that funds contributed by their employers for the benefit of the employees and their families might be diverted to union purposes, or even to the private benefit of faithless union leaders.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.671" offset="745979">There's no such allegation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.535" offset="761339">With particular reference to the requirement in 302(c)(5) that a benefit plan be maintained for the sole and exclusive benefit of employees, this Court stated that its plain meaning is simply that employer contributions to employee benefit trust funds must accrue to the benefit of employees and their families and dependents to the exclusion of all others, and especially pertinent for the instant action, this Court specifically concluded in Robinson that nothing in 302(c)(5), quote, places any restriction on the allocation of the funds among the persons protected by 302(c)(5).</text>
            <text syncTime="207.366" offset="956735">Even the narrow holding in Robinson is applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.853" offset="986619">That is, that the Federal courts have no authority under section 302 to review for reasonableness a collectively bargained term of an employee benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.069" offset="1039491">That describes the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.863" offset="1054746">The collective bargaining agreements to which the respondent employers were parties are clear that the terms of the trust agreements are incorporated by reference, and those trust agreements prohibit the payments that the Second Circuit has ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.036" offset="1135413">It is submitted that the trustees in this case certainly breached no fiduciary duties in administering the trust in accordance with their trust agreements.</text>

            <text syncTime="771.717" offset="3214133">As we've noted already in answer to Judge Scalia... Justice Scalia's question, 302(c)(5) is an exception to a criminal statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="785.397" offset="3268781">It says nothing about the transferring of plan assets, and as we've noted, the legislative history doesn't even mention it.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.581" offset="3297515">Strongly mitigating against the Second Circuit's expansive interpretation of 302(c)(5) are the dire consequences that would follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.139" offset="3347775">The uncontroverted expert testimony in this record is that the construction of the Second Circuit would undermine the viability of multiemployer plans generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.178" offset="3399915">Contrast such a result with the congressional intention to preserve the financial integrity of multiemployer plans not only by the enactment of 302 but of ERISA and the Multiemployer Pension Plans Amendments Act of 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.491" offset="3477238">Congress was well aware of the importance of multiemployer plans as a delivery system of employee benefits to some 9 million workers and their families.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.940" offset="3531050">Further indicating that 302 is not a regulatory act is the fact that from the mid-fifties to the early seventies the Congress and the executive branch became increasingly concerned about the lack of regulation of employee benefit plans, and this concern culminated in the enactment of ERISA in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.299" offset="3640451">In the words of this Court in Teamsters v. Daniel, quote, Congress believed that it was filling a regulatory void when it enacted ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.547" offset="3689457">ERISA extensively regulates the use of plan assets, including transfers of assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.602" offset="3721639">This is to be expected from a statute which this Court has described as comprehensive and reticulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.338" offset="3752568">ERISA includes at least five provisions that bear on the transfer of assets ordered by the Second Circuit, and each one of them would prohibit the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.998" offset="3803246">Thus, we have the anomaly of the court below ordering the trustees of the petitioner funds to violate ERISA and the Court's order would not be a defense to the violation of the prohibited transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.757" offset="3870224">It is submitted that this result cannot be attributed to congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.450" offset="3893003">The judgment below calls into question basic principles underpinning multiemployer benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.809" offset="3938456">The essence of multiemployer plans is the pooling of risks among many employers and employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.094" offset="3971579">In typical multiemployer plans, employer contributions do not reflect the differences in work force demographics of contributing employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.361" offset="4020689">For example, one employer may have a work force with an average age of 50, and another contributing employer may have a work force with an average age of 30, yet they pay contributions at the same rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.302" offset="4084428">Contributions may be based on hours of service, or ton of coal produced, or percentage of payroll, as in the case of the petitioner funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.540" offset="4129359">Therefore, for example, in a multiemployer health benefit plan, it is inevitable that the value of the health benefits needed by the employees of some contributing employers will exceed the contributions made by their employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.142" offset="4203860">This is made possible because other contributing employers will pay contributions in excess of the value of the benefits received by their employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.819" offset="4246492">But the court below says that when an employer withdraws from the plan, section 302(c)(5) requires that if the assets of the plan have increased during the period of the withdrawal... withdrawing employer contributing... contributed to the plan, a proportionate share of that increase in assets must be transferred to the plan... by the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.547" offset="4357460">According to the court below, the proportion to be paid is the ratio of the contributions of the withdrawing employer to the total contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.036" offset="4399360">The Second Circuit's mandate could, if taken literally, require that the petitioner funds pay out substantial moneys even if the benefits received by the employees of the withdrawing employers exceeded their contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.646" offset="4465816">As a plan's obligations grow, normally its assets also grow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.701" offset="4502074">Thus, the proportionate share of the plan's assets which the court below would require the plan to pay upon the withdrawal of the withdrawing employer would also grow, and thereby encourage withdrawals and the ultimate demise of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.954" offset="4579083">The court below thereby would impose a new obligation which the actuaries and trustees did not and could not take into account when they were projecting the cost of benefits to be provided and other costs in determining the level of contributions needed to cover those benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.868" offset="4666750">If the plan's assets can be invaded in such a major way as the court below has mandated, where will the money come from to pay for the benefits the plan is obligated to pay in the future?</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.669" offset="4729966">It is to be noted that the Second Circuit's holding is a one-way street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.152" offset="4755879">If the plan's assets rise during the participation of the group of withdrawing employers, the petitioner funds must pay out plan assets, but if the plan's assets diminish, apparently no payment to the petitioner funds would be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.155" offset="4823902">No insurance arrangement can survive under a system which requires paying out of gains and absorbing all the losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.953" offset="4867057">It is instructive that the single circumstance where Congress has mandated a transfer of assets from one multiemployer plan to another, that Congress does not define the appropriate amount of assets to be transferred with reference to contributions or reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.067" offset="4955559">The only situation where Congress has mandated transfer of assets is where employees move from one multiemployer plan to another multiemployer plan as a result of a certified change of collective bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.068" offset="5027553">In that instance, ERISA requires a transfer of an appropriate amount of assets, and that term is statutorily defined in section 4235(g) of ERISA, which appears in the appendix to the petition at page 48(a) to mean the value of the nonforfeitable benefits to be transferred minus any employer withdrawal liability to the transferor plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.349" offset="5156598">I might add that when it is the transfer of nonforfeitable benefits, which is the same as vested benefits, it is the transfer of the obligation to pay those benefits and therefore it's the same as the transfer of liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.561" offset="5213440">In the present case, no vested benefits have been transferred to the respondent's new benefit plans, therefore, even if there had been a certified change of collective bargaining representative in this case, which there was not, since it's the same union representing both... in both plans, the amount of assets required to be transferred would be zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.977" offset="5323155">The expansive interpretation of 302(c)(5) and the failure of some lower Federal courts to apply this Court's Robinson decision has resulted in unnecessary litigation and uncertainty among plan sponsors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.513" offset="5413329">Some Federal courts even assert authority to rewrite the terms of benefit plans when they deem them to be unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.058" offset="5451468">In effect, the Second Circuit has stricken the provisions of the trust agreements barring transfers of assets in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.136" offset="5495772">In Mahoney v. Board of Trustees, just less than 6 months ago, the First Circuit held that a decision by a plan sponsor to increase retirement benefits of retired participants in a lesser amount than the increase for active participants was subject to review by the Federal courts as to whether the decision was arbitrary and capricious.</text>

            <text syncTime="1568.144" offset="6399817">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.469" offset="6433150">Our position is that the plain language of section 302(c)(5) of the LMRA requires that contributions made by an employer benefit that employer's employees either alone or jointly with, in a pool, as most multiemployer plans are set up, with contributions of other contributing employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.270" offset="6548297">In the language of the syllogism that we used in our brief, A must benefit, or A and B must benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.927" offset="6586959">Each of the Greater Funds, both the pension and the welfare fund, will violate 302(c)(5) unless there is a transfer because some of the contributions paid by the Southern Employers helped create a pool surplus in each of the Greater Funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.662" offset="6673894">A surplus existed in each of the funds at the time all of the employees of the Southern Employers withdrew from each fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="1753.952" offset="7143053">Well, if that's the way you interpret it, then it seems to me that the extension of your argument is that even if some employees of a particular employer leave, the result would still be to transfer the assets.</text>

            <text syncTime="1778.727" offset="7242110">On the welfare side, they will have an opportunity to receive medical and other coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.823" offset="7270531">The difference is, in our situation, there is no one left who is available to earn a benefit beyond the benefits that are already calculated in the liabilities of the Greater Funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.493" offset="7333225">When only half of the employees leave, the half of the employees that remain in the fund, for example, are still entitled to medical coverage, and they may have many catastrophic events that occur which create significant liabilities for the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.018" offset="7431341">They are still in the pool, and therefore from our syllogism some of the employees of A are benefiting in the pool with the other contributing employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.098" offset="7487661">We believe that to be distinctly different from our situation, where all the liabilities are fixed, and there is no opportunity at all for the Southern Employees to receive any benefit from the contributions that made up... that went to make up this surplus.</text>

            <text syncTime="1875.172" offset="7627886">Isn't the reference to paid, as opposed, for example, to money or things of value held... doesn't that indicate that a violation or not is to be judged with respect to the terms of the fund at the time the money is paid over?</text>

            <text syncTime="1898.957" offset="7723076">If that were the case, the entire protective value of section 302(c)(5) would be essentially eliminated, because once the money went in on Friday, if on Monday a union official ran away with the money, 302(c)(5) would not apply its protective value, which is reflected in the legislative history.</text>
