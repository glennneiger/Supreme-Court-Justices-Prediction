            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="143406">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 91-2045, R. Gordon Darby v. Henry Cisneros.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.019" offset="187396">Mr. Gordon.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_d_gordon" startTime="12.529" stopTime="233.476">
            <label>Mr. Steven D. Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="12.529" offset="193457">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.193" offset="212160">In enacting the Administrative Procedure Act, Congress provided a general authorization for judicial review of administrative actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.469" offset="245179">In section 10(c) of the act, it prescribed when and under what circumstances someone who is aggrieved by an agency action may seek recourse in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.798" offset="294498">Congress provided that a litigant need not exhaust available administrative remedies before proceeding to Federal court, unless such exhaustion is expressly required by statute or by agency rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.136" offset="355938">The question presented in this case is whether, notwithstanding that Congress has spoken, a Federal court can impose additional exhaustion requirements and deprive a litigant of judicial review under the APA because he failed to pursue an administrative appeal that was not required by statute nor by the agency's own regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.882" offset="450919">The answer to this question, we submit, is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.344" offset="464712">The facts of this case are straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.476" offset="477251">In 1989, HUD initiated administrative sanctions against petitioners, Mr. Darby and his affiliates.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.794" offset="510479">Mr. Darby contested those sanctions in full conformance with HUD's regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.196" offset="536183">He litigated the matter before the agency for some 10 months through a process which included discovery, a 4-day evidentiary hearing, and the submission of post-hearing briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.604" offset="585816">Ultimately, a HUD administrative law judge issued a lengthy written decision which upheld the sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.313" offset="628657">Pursuant to HUD's regulations, the ALJ's decision became the final agency action unless the Secretary chose to review it.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.710" offset="666168">In this case, neither party sought such secretarial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.130" offset="683827">Mr. Darby then filed this suit in Federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.614" offset="705770">He challenged the sanctions on the grounds that they violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.782" offset="746521">The Government moved to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.894" offset="766897">The district court denied this motion and proceeded to grant relief to Mr. Darby, holding that the sanctions were not rationally supported by the facts and that they had been imposed for forbidden punitive reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.015" offset="827396">The Government appealed to the Fourth Circuit, challenging only the district court's ruling on exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.760" offset="862400">The Government contended that HUD's regulation providing for secretarial review of an ALJ's decision required Mr. Darby to seek secretarial review as a prerequisite to filing suit in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.442" offset="933140">The Fourth Circuit rejected that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.614" offset="945783">The circuit court recognized that no statute and no regulation required Mr. Darby to seek secretarial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.262" offset="996356">Nonetheless, it decided that as a, quote, rule of judicial administration, Mr. Darby was required to exhaust this administrative remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.089" offset="1039719">Since he had not done so, the court ruled that the district court should have dismissed his suit and left the administrative sanctions in effect.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="233.476" offset="1077231">Mr. Gordon, what if your client had, in fact, taken an appeal within the agency?</text>
            <text syncTime="239.510" offset="1101368">Your position then is, I take it, that still and all, you would be able to come to court and prosecute an appeal both in court and before the agency.</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven D. Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="255.839" offset="1166675">Justice Scalia, I believe that... that under the line of decisions, including particularly ICC v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, that at the point that the ALJ's decision became... was issued, that Mr. Darby had an option, and that he could have either pursued and administrative appeal or proceeded to Federal court.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="278.045" offset="1255491">Why... why is that?</text>
            <text syncTime="279.435" offset="1261133">Because... I mean the text of section 704 reads</text>
            <text syncTime="283.418" offset="1277016">"whether or not there has been filed. "</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven D. Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="286.200" offset="1288196">And there was an interesting line of cases during the 1950's where the Federal courts, the circuit courts, wrestled with whether, if you pursued an administrative appeal, the time for your appeal to Federal court would meanwhile expire.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.551" offset="1353607">The Ninth Circuit, in a case called Consolidated Flowers, as I recall, held that you could lose your right to judicial review if you pursued the administrative appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.517" offset="1393417">The D.C. circuit ruled to the contrary and ultimately the Ninth Circuit reversed course.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.394" offset="1424973">And I believe this Court has recognized ever since a decision in the early sixties, CAB v. Delta Airlines, that if you do pursue an administrative appeal, that the agency action is, pending that appeal, not final and therefore not appealable to Federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="339.815" offset="1502609">It says whether or not there has been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.286" offset="1512536">What I'm saying is maybe we've been playing with 704 up to now; why don't we continue to do that?</text>

            <text syncTime="376.708" offset="1650149">Why isn't... why couldn't I consider that ridiculous too and say I certainly don't want to interpret 704 to provide for that?</text>

            <text syncTime="382.562" offset="1673555">Well, the Court is not writing on a clean slate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.717" offset="1694244">It seems to us that the fundamental principle is that it is for Congress to prescribe the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.042" offset="1727471">And this Court has recognized repeatedly, and as recently as last term in McCarthy v. Madigan, that when Congress has prescribed that jurisdiction, that Federal courts are not to decline such jurisdiction on exhaustion principles unless it's consistent with the expressed intent of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="419.286" offset="1820467">The language of 704 does not permit what you've just said we've done.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.938" offset="1839066">The language of 704 says that it's final, whether or not there has been lodged an appeal within the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.063" offset="1863622">But you tell me that if there has been lodged an appeal within the agency, we will not consider it final, despite the language of 704, right?</text>

            <text syncTime="483.077" offset="2075631">The second section... sentence of the section provides that intermediate rulings, or procedural or preliminary rulings, are not directly appealable, but may be heard when the final agency action is appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.238" offset="2136340">The third sentence, which is what's at issue here, presupposes final agency action and goes on to address whether there are additional procedural requirements that a litigant must follow.</text>

            <text syncTime="3080.701" offset="12466201">Well, the decision whether to debar is expressly made a discretionary decision, and... and it involves weighing the seriousness of the acts against the mitigating circumstances and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.298" offset="12512595">Those are decisions that the Secretary should have had a chance to make, if petitioner didn't like them, before... before the ALJ's decision was reviewed by a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.513" offset="12545404">In addition, of course, there's a lot of expertise involved here in interpreting HUD's regulations and in interpreting the debarment procedure itself and the standards for debarment, as well as the substantive standards governing the program the petitioner participated in.</text>

            <text syncTime="3264.552" offset="13201600">I'd like to address several points, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.135" offset="13227932">The first is what I believe to be the absolutely erroneous contention that the Government has advanced that the decision of the Fourth Circuit here was consistent with the existing law of exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.662" offset="13274012">The law of exhaustion, from the time of Meyers v. Bethlehem Steel up through this Court's decision last term in McCarthy v. Madigan, has always been that litigants are required to exhaust the prescribed administrative remedy, and that phrase "prescribed" is critical and it has always been there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.532" offset="13333466">And in our view, all that section 10(c) of the APA did was to ordain which remedies would be considered prescribed for purposes of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.600" offset="13373799">Moreover, the law had always been that litigants need not exhaust permissive administrative appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.136" offset="13411938">In Levers v. Anderson, decided by this Court a year before the APA was passed, Justice Black, writing for the Court... precisely this contention was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.422" offset="13449032">The Government stood up and said that the litigant was out of luck because they hadn't pursued a permissive motion for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.714" offset="13474214">And Justice Black said that the Court was not persuaded that "may" means "must",--</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.327" offset="13488634">And yet that's what we hear from the Government, "may" means "must".</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.391" offset="13504934">And if you, as the litigant, if you're sufficiently seasoned, if you can't figure that out, shame on you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.644" offset="13525937">That is nothing less than turning these administrative appeals into traps for the unwary, which was completely at odds with what Congress set out to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="3378.165" offset="13656026">I would also... on the facts here, the Government has pooh-poohed the notion that the LDP, which was in effect throughout, had much of an impact on Mr. Darby.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.845" offset="13706704">The record reflects, and this is in an affidavit filed before the district court, that during the 10 months that he'd already been under the sanctions, he had lost a HUD contract that he anticipated would have been worth approximately a half a million dollars of profit to his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.545" offset="13781519">So this is a litigant who diligently did everything that HUD told him to do pursuant to its regulations at the same time he was enduring a tremendous cost for doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.513" offset="13821434">And the Government suggests that there was little cost in him being required to jump through further hoops.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.307" offset="13848601">If the additional 75 days for the secretarial appeal... and that's under an optimistic time frame... had gone by, the LDP could have expired, because it's limited to a year, and according to the Government in its pleadings before this Court, once it expires it becomes a moot issue because it doesn't have the continuing consequences that a debarment does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.461" offset="13933238">So the Government propounds, in our view, nothing less than a catch 22 here, and we don't believe that the exhaustion doctrine is a catch 22 or should be construed by this Court to place litigants in that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.619" offset="13985796">If there are no questions from the Court, that concludes my presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.361" offset="14000843">Thank you.</text>
