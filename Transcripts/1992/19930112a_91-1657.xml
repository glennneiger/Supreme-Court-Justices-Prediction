            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="138641">We'll hear argument now in No. 91-1657, Charlene Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.240" offset="191513">Mr. Gladden.</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_gladden" startTime="14.532" stopTime="260.601">
            <label>Mr. Richard Gladden</label>
            <text syncTime="14.532" offset="196737">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="20.626" offset="221083">In this case, the petitioners challenge what's known as the Fifth Circuit's heightened pleading requirement, which that court applies in civil rights cases brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C., section 1983 with respect to allegations against local governmental entities wherein plaintiffs allege that the local governmental entity has failed to adequately train, allegations similar to those presented in City of Canton v. Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.585" offset="336963">It's the petitioners' contention that the heightened pleading requirement violates the system of notice pleading set out in rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and alternatively, to the extent that a heightened pleading requirement is permissible under rule 8, petitioners go further and state that they believe that that violates the rule's enabling act, title 28 U.S.C., section 2072(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="76.241" offset="443542">Before going much further, I would like to briefly outline for the Court the procedural and factual background which led to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.757" offset="473635">The case originally arose out of a search of the Leatherman residence which occurred in May of 1989.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.051" offset="502788">In that case, governmental officers, under the control of the Tarrant County narcotics task force, secured a search warrant for their premises and upon entering the premises shot and killed two of their dogs, and after discovering, just within moments, that there was no narcotics laboratory within the premises, proceeded to lounge about in the front of the yard, basically just kind of enhancing and aggravating the anxiety that the family was already experiencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.371" offset="616055">Mrs. Leatherman and her son Travis were there on the premises at the time the dogs were shot... or at the end of the driveway, some 100 feet away.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.776" offset="649701">They filed a lawsuit in State court pursuant to section 1983 alleging a violation of the Fourth Amendment with respect to the manner in which the search was conducted by the officers and the shooting of their dogs, which they considered to be an unreasonable seizure of their effect, the dog being the effect in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.687" offset="721381">The petitioner... the Leatherman petitioners' former counsel filed the case in State court and was unable, prior to filing it in State court, to get access to any documents to identify the individual officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.266" offset="775611">He made numerous attempts to try to secure documents which would more particularly describe what customs they may have and what prior incidents might have occurred similar to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.053" offset="814794">He was unable to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.936" offset="822318">Following the filing of his complaint and our petition in State court, the respondents immediately removed the case to Federal court, and immediately thereafter filed a motion to dismiss on 12(b) or for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.594" offset="880937">The petitioner... the Leatherman petitioners' former counsel had not been admitted to practice in Federal court and while he was trying to locate other counsel to handle the case, the court initially acted on the motion to dismiss and dismissed the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.934" offset="938301">Following my becoming involved in the case, I moved the court to vacate the dismissal and allow the petitioners to replea their complaint, if possible to conform to the technical pleading requirements that the court in the Fifth Circuit or courts in the Fifth Circuit apply, specifically the heightened pleading requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.707" offset="1021371">During the course in time in which we were drafting the amended complaint, our office became aware of another incident also involving the Tarrant County drug task force wherein the officers had displayed similar lack of supervision with respect to the entry of the residence unannounced, clubbing of an elderly gentleman, remaining on the premises some hour and a half to 2 hours after determining that there was no drugs on the premises or drug laboratory on the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.574" offset="1128891">I came to the conclusion that there was a consistent pattern there, and for that reason, pursuant to 20(a), rule 20(a), I added this separate incident, together with the Leathermans' lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="266.686" offset="1205377">Chief Justice, if I recollect, it says that you have a common transaction in question element.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.350" offset="1227947">If you have a pattern of actions by the same identified source and you have common legal questions or common factual questions, the rules permit a joinder of what would otherwise seem to be separate incidences if you have a common factual question or a common legal question.</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_gladden" startTime="293.755" stopTime="503.563">
            <label>Mr. Richard Gladden</label>
            <text syncTime="293.755" offset="1313629">Well, it was... we just amended the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.967" offset="1326481">I know the district court was uncertain at the time it acted or entered its decision as to what legal authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.320" offset="1347901">The issue had never been raised by the respondents, and therefore it had never been briefed.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.112" offset="1367023">In any event, following the amended complaint being filed, the respondent, TCNICU, who I'll just call the drug task force, filed virtually the identical motion to dismiss or for summary judgment, and at that time attached some unverified police reports and such like that that allowed us to get a little bit more information, but still not enough to recognize on an evidentiary basis sufficient facts to perhaps defend a motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.866" offset="1494083">At that time, I filed a motion to stay action on the motion for summary judgment pursuant to rule 56(f) because there had not been sufficient discovery from my position to feel comfortable with the court acting on it at that time, and that was also briefed in the district court in response to their motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.855" offset="1570047">In response... discovery or motion for... excuse me... production of documents, the respondent drug task force filed a motion for a protective order, and they claimed, I believe, four different privileges, including executive privilege, why they shouldn't have to disclose any documents in connection with the operation of their drug task force.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.031" offset="1662729">As a result, the court, the district court, entered a protective order and prevented me from getting any other documents other than those voluntarily provided by the drug task force.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.137" offset="1707137">Some... and I had also asked for a hearing on that, and the hearing was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.521" offset="1724692">Some 3 weeks later, the court granted their motion to dismiss based on the heightened pleading requirement, but went further and acted on the motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.027" offset="1766697">And, however, on appeal the Fifth Circuit only affirmed on the basis of the heightened pleading requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.562" offset="1792819">That pretty much concludes the procedural posture of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.945" offset="1806403">It's the petitioners' position that there are several reasons why the heightened pleading requirement is inconsistent with the notice pleading that this Court set out in Conley v. Gibson.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.561" offset="1848825">In Conley v. Gibson, the Court said that fair... that a plaintiff under rule 8... and that was yet again a case where the people, the respondents, had said that you had to have specific allegations to support your claims, and the Court in response to that said that under rule 8 a plaintiff only need show fair notice of their claim and the grounds upon which it rests.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.286" offset="1943702">We believe that in this case, the respondent certainly had fair notice of both the legal and factual basis of the claim with respect to the constitutional allegation and certainly had an understanding that the theory of relief was pursuant to City of Canton v. Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.446" offset="2000336">They were so able to understand the allegations that they were able to file a motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.340" offset="2027921">However, they didn't provide any documentation with respect to what their training was or whether there had been prior incidences.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.066" offset="2058850">Yet again, because the protective order had been entered, I was unable to get such documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.578" offset="2076927">It's our position that not only does rule 8 and Conley v. Gibson preclude any understanding of rule 8 to allow a heightened pleading requirement, but we also believe that rule 9(b) certainly read in harmony with rule 8 would negate the possibility of a heightened pleading requirement.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard Gladden</label>
            <text syncTime="534.791" offset="2277756">Well, Your Honor, I think the court denied the discovery, and it's my impression that he denied the discovery on the basis that the heightened pleading requirement foreclosed the lawsuit proceeding further to discovery because under a heightened pleading requirement, you wouldn't be allowed discovery unless you could get through a motion to dismiss.</text>

            <text syncTime="552.462" offset="2348391">So, then perhaps your answer to my question should be yes, that had the district court denied the motion to dismiss, it would have been more lenient about allowing discovery.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_gladden" startTime="562.871" stopTime="727.028">
            <label>Mr. Richard Gladden</label>
            <text syncTime="562.871" offset="2390083">I certainly think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.471" offset="2392486">I think in the absence of a heightened pleading requirement, he would have been more lenient.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.044" offset="2406801">Most of the case law that he cited in support of denying discovery was connected or intertwined with cases involving the heightened pleading requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.540" offset="2436790">Back to rule 9(b), another suggestion we have or argument we have is that 9(b) sets out what kinds of claims there are that require particularity in pleading complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.309" offset="2495826">It's limited to fraud and mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.682" offset="2509305">Nowhere is there any mention of a heightened pleading requirement for civil rights cases or some unidentified other class of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.114" offset="2535010">And then it goes on to say that allegations involving knowledge, malice, intent, or other condition of mind, which I think in this case deliberate indifference on the part of the municipal policymaker would certainly be a condition of mind... rule 9(b) says that only general allegations are required with respect to pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.580" offset="2620901">Now, it seems to me that throughout this litigation, both the respondents and the lower courts, not necessarily Judge Goldberg, but they have concluded... or they have confused the difference between a rule for summary judgment where evidence has to be pled and presented and a motion to dismiss where you are only required to give fair notice of the claim that you're presenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.553" offset="2712852">I would say again the respondents in this case had fair notice of what the factual basis of the constitutional allegation was, and they had fair notice, at least to my ability to plead it, that we were challenging the inadequacy of their training and that we believed, on information and belief, that there were other incidences that would support our claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.131" offset="2815147">Justice Scalia has, on more than one occasion, stated that we should apply the text to the rules and not improve upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.718" offset="2857465">It seems to me that the lower courts who have imposed the heightened pleading requirement have done so in an effort to improve upon what they consider to be a problem with the Federal rules in protecting municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.496" offset="2904590">The City of Owen... or Owen v. City of Independence addressed the question of whether municipalities are entitled to qualified immunity, and the Court ruled that it wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.953" offset="2942416">This heightened pleading requirement originally derived out of the need to protect individual defendants who had a right to assert qualified immunity from broad ranging discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.851" offset="2998004">I don't think that there's necessarily a problem with limiting broad ranging discovery in any case under rule 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.296" offset="3031754">I think a district judge certainly could isolate issues and allow discovery to go forward on that basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1574.245" offset="6435614">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.934" offset="6490367">The respondents in this case, various municipalities in Tarrant County, ask that the Fifth Circuit's opinion... judgment be affirmed, and that this Court embrace a heightened pleading requirement in cases arising under section 1983 against municipalities alleging that officers have not been properly trained or what has been known as failure to train cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.541" offset="6588796">This is especially critical in cases against municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.533" offset="6608754">Until and unless there is a demonstration of a municipal policy at issue, the case amounts to nothing more than an allegation of vicarious liability for which municipalities are not and have never been liable either at the common law or under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.366" offset="6688061">This Court has consistently reaffirmed that proposition, having stated in Monell that municipalities may not be sued under a theory of respondeat superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.792" offset="6733723">This case is more than just a Monell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.807" offset="6753785">This case is actually governed by City of Canton v. Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.150" offset="6771235">In a failure to train case, the heightened pleading requirement we submit should contain three requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.175" offset="6807284">First, the plaintiff should be required to allege a clearly established constitutional violation for without such an allegation, there is, indeed, no policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.731" offset="6853469">This is not a case like Monell where all the plaintiff should have to demonstrate is the presence of a policy of the municipality and that policy caused harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.630" offset="6897145">By definition, in a case like this, there is no policy unless there is deliberate indifference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.288" offset="6935702">It is only when a failure to train arises to the level of deliberate indifference that a policy, which is actionable under 1983, has even been identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.952" offset="6982409">Secondly, the plaintiff should be required to plead sufficient facts to indicate a pattern of similar allegedly unconstitutional acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.439" offset="7020339">More than a single act is clearly necessary for liability, as this Court has taught us in Oklahoma City v. Tuttle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.487" offset="7052522">Similarly, a failure to train case at bottom is a case alleging that municipal policymakers responsible for the training of police officers have not responded to a concern or a problem of which they have notice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1755.113" offset="7158997">And I would think that perhaps before, in our deliberations, we got to what the content of such a requirement should be, we would get to whether it's authorized at all under the rules in view of the plain statement language in rule 8 and the fact that certainly some sort of expressio unius argument derives from the fraud and mistake special pleading requirement in rule 9.</text>

            <text syncTime="1799.791" offset="7337779">I think the petitioners want the Court to put the word notice as the only requirement of rule 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.498" offset="7376545">Rule 8 is more than a requirement of giving factual notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.351" offset="7392009">Rule 8 requires notice of a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.764" offset="7405697">So, even if you have a case where all of the facts that could conceivably be known are laid out... in essence, there is attached to the pleading, as an exhibit, a videotape which contains every fact upon which the claim is asserted... rule 8 is still not met unless it states a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.917" offset="7482288">For example, let's use the pleading in this case as an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.630" offset="7497126">I suggest that the pleading in this case is nothing more than a case of individual responsibility of an officer to which is attached a boiler plate allegation that there is failure to train and deliberate indifference.</text>

            <text syncTime="1873.160" offset="7631186">But the point I'm making is for there to be a claim stated, under City of Canton v. Harris, there has to be a policy present, and unless there's some basis to suggest that there is deliberate indifference, it doesn't even state a policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.262" offset="7699627">Deliberate indifference in a City of Canton v. Harris case is part of the definition of a policy unlike in other cases against municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.997" offset="7734527">And as... rule 8 is not controlling in a situation if what that procedural rule permits would violate a substantive right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.506" offset="7784577">And I believe the right of a municipality to be free from liability for what is nothing more than a respondeat superior or vicarious liability theory is going to be thwarted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.755" offset="7837658">That right will cease to exist if municipalities must defend cases where on the bare allegation of the existence of a policy and the bare allegation of deliberate indifference, the municipality must defend that case.</text>
