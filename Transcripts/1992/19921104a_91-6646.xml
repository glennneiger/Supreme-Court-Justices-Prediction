            <text syncTime="14.522" offset="204229">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.982" offset="218126">The question in this case is whether or not the courts below correctly applied Rules 404(b) and 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence in order to assure a fair trial below.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.589" offset="260549">More specifically, if the issue of intent is not a disputed issue at trial, and the defense offers a genuine, judicial admission on the issue of intent, should the prosecution be allowed to admit overwhelming amounts of uncharged misconduct evidence under the ruse of proving the marginal statutory issue of intent, and secondly, should the prosecution be allowed to ambush the accused with eleventh-hour prior bad conduct evidence?</text>
            <text syncTime="57.709" offset="377055">Let me highlight some of the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.822" offset="389489">Mr. Hadley was a teacher in Chilchinbeto, Arizona, a rural area on the Navajo Indian Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.834" offset="413522">He had never previously been convicted of any crimes whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.846" offset="429613">This was his first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.458" offset="435987">During a parallel investigation in Chilchinbeto involving another teacher, it came to the attention of FBI agents that Mr. Hadley may have a tendency to be a homosexual.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.035" offset="478306">As a result, the FBI interviewed all sixth, seventh, and eighth graders in Chilchinbeto... over 75 students... and asked them specifically about Mr. Hadley.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.502" offset="524177">There were no identified victims, and Mr. Hadley was not known to be a suspect before any of these interviews commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.137" offset="550717">During the same time, during the pendency of this case, there were congressional hearings regarding what was perceived as an epidemic of child molestation on the Navajo Indian Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.984" offset="590110">The victims in this case, besides Cory K., who testified as a prior bad act witness, never mentioned that Mr. Hadley had touched or molested them to anyone else other than the FBI either before or after the interviews.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.793" offset="649355">During the FBI interviews, many students at trial testified that the FBI told them that they knew that Mr. Hadley had touched other students and they were only interested to find out if he had touched them, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.993" offset="706198">They were told that they couldn't leave the room unless and until they told them what Mr. Hadley had done with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.116" offset="730648">They testified that they were afraid of the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.867" offset="741620">Many witnesses testified that the FBI told them that we can charge you with perjury if you don't tell us the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.713" offset="773071">There were no adults, other than the FBI agents, present when the children were interviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.957" offset="793969">It was a very, we think, coercive environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.671" offset="816853">Several students during trial testified that they had been forced by the FBI to make up stories about Verl Hadley.</text>

            <text syncTime="176.868" offset="853633">Mr. Trebon, how does this bear on the questions presented here, which seem to deal mostly with Rule 403?</text>

            <text syncTime="183.480" offset="880069">What I'm trying to show in this case, that there were genuine disputes about what occurred in this particular case, and the problem with 404(b) evidence is that it tends to draw the attention of the jurors away from the facts in dispute in this case, and tend to paint the defendant as a bad person or show that he has a predisposition for committing these types of offenses, and in this case that's exactly what it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.177" offset="970870">The prior bad act evidence was absolutely overwhelming.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.199" offset="982991">It was very prejudicial, and smeared the defendant, so that the facts in dispute in this case could not be fairly decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.515" offset="1012248">Intent was the basis for admitting the prior bad conduct evidence, Mr. Chief Justice, and intent in this case was merely a marginal issue required by Federal statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="253.870" offset="1161669">In other words, it was placed in the statute merely to distinguish innocent or accidental touchings from intentional or sexual touchings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2822.644" offset="11436777">It's clear that the district judge was not laying down an absolute rule that he would not require the Government to accept a stipulation and offer to stipulate in any case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2843.877" offset="11521728">There's no per se rule of the court of appeals on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.310" offset="11535416">The court of appeals addressed the question of whether something is not disputed, and that's quite a different matter if an issue is not disputed whether the Government could introduce evidence going to intent, but because this issue was really put before the court of appeals only in a very tangential way in the defendant's court of appeals briefs... two sentences, I think, on page 37 and 38 of the defendant's briefs... it's not surprising that the court of appeals didn't address this question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3302.109" offset="13354583">There is no exception under Rule 404(b) for a weak modus operandi case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.133" offset="13382691">That does not somehow become corroboration, that does not somehow become plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="3317.051" offset="13414351">There was no identity issue in this case, number 1, and number 2, there was no finding by the trial court that these acts were so similar as to constitute modus operandi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.685" offset="13452908">There was no signature to crime in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.588" offset="13464506">Moreover, corroboration evidence is no different than propensity evidence unless it corroborates the act on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.465" offset="13504004">You cannot call someone as a corroboration witness if they speak about a different act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.579" offset="13528454">They have to corroborate the specific act on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.280" offset="13539321">That's corroboration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.980" offset="13546113">If corroboration is used so broadly that if crime A is on trial and you corroborate to another person that crime B was committed, that's not corroborating what's on trial, that's simply propensity evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.890" offset="13597731">There's no difference between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.369" offset="13603687">All the commenters say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.292" offset="13611315">Professor Imwenkerlied and others say that that is a false use of corroboration testimony in order to get around 404(b) and 403.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.308" offset="13651439">That is simply unallowable in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.681" offset="13660947">Secondly, following up on Justice Kennedy, let me tell you that the acts in this case were not that similar anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.825" offset="13685502">Counts VII and VIII involving Amadee R. take place inside of a car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.156" offset="13702848">The acts that they want you to believe that it's similar to are supposedly full-blown sodomy attempts in a bedroom with lotion and all the things that they put in their brief, none of which existed in counts VII and VIII.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.453" offset="13747987">They simply were not very similar at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.425" offset="13759899">There was no use of that evidence for purposes of corroboration in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.880" offset="13785708">When we offered to stipulate, we offered to stipulate intent out of the case unequivocally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.664" offset="13808800">There was no doubt about the full force and validity of our stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.557" offset="13824369">What the Government is telling you now is that Judge Carroll didn't like the stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.599" offset="13840565">Judge Carroll didn't want to add anything to our stipulation relating to the element of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.071" offset="13862508">He wanted me to stipulate that the prior bad acts had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.564" offset="13876405">It didn't make any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.177" offset="13890929">Why would I have to stipulate that the prior bad acts had occurred?</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.608" offset="13900647">The only thing in question was intent, and I offered a stipulation or concession, if you will, Mr. Chief Justice, that that was satisfied to a concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.098" offset="13946622">The comment to Rule 401 says that the trial court should consider concession on a point at trial in lieu of actual evidence in order to exclude that evidence, especially 404(b) evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3484.590" offset="14084549">So this was a trial about whether or not these acts occurred, or whether or not they were prompted, similarly to many other witnesses who testified at trial, prompted by the FBI to make accusations against Mr. Hadley.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.898" offset="14141809">It was a case that necessitated a full-blown exploration on the particular acts in question, and all we did by admitting all the prior bad act evidence is to change the focus of the trial to events that occurred 13 to 17 years earlier, and certainly was extremely prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.009" offset="14210250">All the commenters in all the cases say that emotional... that the emotional propensity of child molestation is extremely high, and limiting instructions in this area are very ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.008" offset="14262181">I don't believe that the Government can have it both ways with the jury instruction, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.971" offset="14282035">You can't say Judge Carroll had this broad idea about plan evidence but yet instructed the jury that they couldn't consider the evidence for anything other than mental state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.259" offset="14323204">You had to determine independently whether or no the acts occurred beyond a reasonable doubt, so clearly none of this evidence could have been considered at the trial level to determine the actus reus of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.385" offset="14367716">That's simply implausible under the jury instruction that was given by Judge Carroll.</text>

            <text syncTime="3610.721" offset="14589026">It couldn't have been, because the trier of fact couldn't have used it in some other fashion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3618.497" offset="14620164">If I thought that this was going to be corroboration evidence rather than going to the mental intent that the judge had just given to the jury, I would have had to delve deeper in my cross-examination of some of these witnesses, especially Kyle Hartman, who I didn't cross-examine at all... hardly at all.</text>
