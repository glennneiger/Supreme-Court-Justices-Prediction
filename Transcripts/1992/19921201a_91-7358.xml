            <text syncTime="15.610" offset="204334">Mr. Brecht was convicted after a jury trial after the special prosecutor in this case first on cross-examination of Mr. Brecht then on re-cross initial closing argument and final closing argument, breached a promise that had been made to Mr. Brecht that if he remained silent at a certain point in time that silence would not be used against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.625" offset="300361">The case involves a core due process violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.677" offset="316661">It does not involve the Miranda case itself, nor is it a case that involves a prophylactic rule or a prophylactic right.</text>

            <label>Mr. Allen E. Shoenberger</label>
            <text syncTime="66.740" offset="408821">--The promise that was made to him could have been any promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.458" offset="427734">The promise was made, and that's important, but the promise is analogous to the promise that was made in Johnson v. United States, United States v. Hale, Raley v. Ohio, Santobello v. New York, which is the plea bargain line of cases, as well as what was stated in the Cupps v. Louisiana case, where the officers told certain civil rights demonstrators that they had the right to go and demonstrate at a certain place, and then those same demonstrators were prosecuted for demonstrating near the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.365" offset="567332">In all of these cases, the State told somebody they had a right to do something, then attempted in one way or another to penalize them, and this Court in all of those cases said that the use of that penalty against that person violated due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.725" offset="628772">It's also not... this case is also not a prophylactic case.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.445" offset="647685">It does not involve a prophylactic rule, because all that Mr. Brecht is seeking is the specific performance of the promise that was given to him that if he remained silent, that silence would not be used against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.269" offset="702960">On a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is prophylactic, this case is a zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.090" offset="726261">He's seeking exactly the due process performance, the specific performance of the promise that was made that at the trial which was going to be subsequent, or was subsequent to the promise that was made, that the State not be permitted to use its breach of that promise to attempt to secure his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.106" offset="810375">He seeks that to be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.222" offset="818839">The constitutional violation in Mr. Brecht's case would occur at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.925" offset="837647">It's not like the questions of illegal searches and seizures where this Court may have to deal with cases after the constitutional violation has occurred, and the question of remedying that violation that's already occurred is part of what this Court has to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.369" offset="903371">In addition, the case involves, and Doyle involves, a question of the legitimacy of inferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.743" offset="940883">This case does go to what kind of inference can be drawn from the silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.814" offset="965125">At a certain point, we would contend, an inference can become so tenuous that it violates due process to draw the inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.186" offset="1010682">I would suggest that Justice O'Connor's opinion in Estelle v. McGuire suggests the possibility of such matters, but in this case there's a problem of unreliability, that the inferences that may be drawn from his silence and the use of that silence after the Miranda warning is certainly unreliable.</text>

            <text syncTime="257.446" offset="1171701">Actually, it's not exactly clear what statement was made to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.648" offset="1188524">The record only reflects that at the first appearance in court he was given his Miranda rights, but the record that I have seen does not actually contain a text of the rights that were given to him, so we're assuming that the Miranda rights were the typical set of Miranda rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1779.483" offset="7259799">The only thing he did wrong was speak a little too broadly, so that in asking questions or commenting, he used words like, isn't this the first time you ever, and isn't it true that you never, and those words got him into trouble because they encompassed both the pre-Miranda and the post-Miranda, and in this case, of course, there was a ton of pre-Miranda silence and conduct that was very, very probative of guilt, such as him fleeing the scene and stealing the victim's car, and heading for the State line, instead of calling for help, which one would expect if it had been an accidental shooting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.275" offset="7414966">The issue in this case as we see it is what standard should be applied to use to determine when a Federal habeas court should release a State prisoner on habeas?</text>

            <text syncTime="1847.494" offset="7531890">The statute 2254 does not say anything about relief per se, or harmless error, or error per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.717" offset="7564805">The only guidance we find is the terminology in 224 that a Federal court may not entertain a petition unless there is an allegation that the person is in custody in violation of the Constitution, and the language in 2243 that the habeas court shall dispose of the matter as law and justice require.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.248" offset="7658845">Because the statute has not defined when relief is required, this Court must do so, and it is not legislating for this Court to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1933.983" offset="7877856">They have the duty and responsibility and power to define and punish crime, and they may do so without Federal interference unless, of course, by doing so they violate Federal constitutional rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2019.489" offset="8219851">It's just short of automatic reversal, and on direct review it serves many functions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2267.865" offset="9213340">One way to state that is the way that Justice Stevens stated in Miller v. Greer and Rose v. Lundy, which is that errors that are so fundamental that they infect the validity of the underlying judgment itself should be granted relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2663.356" offset="10795316">We think that the Constitution and the criminal justice system of course protect other values besides guilt or innocence, and we're not suggesting that any of these three tests would protect only guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.533" offset="10859995">The other values of the Constitution, such as Doyle itself, it protects something that is not just a question of guilt or innocence, but a question of fairness.</text>

            <label>Mr. William P. Barr</label>
            <text syncTime="2891.155" offset="11706571">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.624" offset="11724439">The position of the United States is that the harmless error standard that should apply on collateral review of constitutional errors is the traditional Kotteakos standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.080" offset="11770205">The Kotteakos rule is the traditional formulation of the harmless error doctrine derived from the common law approach which later found its way into the Federal statutes of 1919 and 1949 and now the Federal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.191" offset="11830705">Chapman is the exception to that traditional doctrine, and in Chapman this Court formed a stricter, a ratcheted up harmless error standard, and in that context, on direct review of constitutional errors, that ratcheted-up standard serves a deterrent function promoting rigorous adherence to constitutional norms at the trial phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.205" offset="11922761">Now, we submit that this should not be carried over to collateral review, the Chapman standard, and this Court has never directly addressed this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.596" offset="11968318">We think there are three reasons for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.047" offset="11978140">First, Kotteakos fully effectuates the purposes of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.951" offset="12001755">Habeas is not supposed to be a full replay of direct review, and there should be no presumption that the rules and the standards that apply on direct review necessarily carry over to habeas corpus review, and for that reason this Court has repeatedly recognized that the rules that apply on habeas should be tailored to the purposes of habeas, and may be different than the rules and the standards that apply in direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.269" offset="12110947">Now, the core purpose of habeas is to protect against the kind of serious constitutional defect that gives rise to a substantial risk that an innocent person has been convicted, and Kotteakos is fully sufficient to meet that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.528" offset="12171969">After all, it is the rule that we use on direct review of nonconstitutional errors which can be more prejudiced than many constitutional errors such as 404(b) violation, and in that context we rely upon the Kotteakos standard, whether there's been a substantial influence in determining the jury's verdict, to assure us--</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3028.192" offset="12254620">General Barr, would you go so far as to say that's true in those cases that have been automatic reversals such as total denial of counsel, or something like that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_p_barr" startTime="3035.281" stopTime="3094.236">

            <text syncTime="3035.281" offset="12283041">--No, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.731" offset="12288788">What I would say is, there are essentially three boxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.268" offset="12302999">The first issue is, is a claim reviewable at all under habeas corpus, or should it receive Stone v. Powell treatment, but if it's a cognizable claim, the next issue is, is it automatically reversible, and there may be some debates about that test, but I don't think Doyle meets that test, and that would put, then, Doyle in the subject-to-harmless-error analysis box.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.650" offset="12404458">So if we can rely on Kotteakos on the direct review of nonconstitutional errors to sort out the reliability of the verdict, I think we can rely upon it in habeas corpus context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.643" offset="12456494">The second reason, I think, that we shouldn't just carry over the Chapman standard, is that the benefits of Chapman... and this goes to your comments, Justice Souter... the benefits of Chapman are largely achieved on direct review.</text>

            <text syncTime="3594.379" offset="14519436">Let me state first that the rule in Chapman is not based upon any particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.818" offset="14557157">It was an attempt by this Court to devise what it described in the decision itself as a Federal right or a Federal rule, and it appears it may be a constitutional rule because it's so closely allied with the enforcement of constitutional rights, but it certainly... Chapman certainly was not interpreting the Federal habeas corpus statutes itself, because the Federal habeas corpus statutes weren't involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.702" offset="14652661">That came later, although a case was argued 4 days before Chapman was announced, the first case in which Justice Black indicated that Chapman ought to apply in Federal habeas corpus, but it's at least until 1970 that the first, if you will, majority of the Court in collective different decisions indicated that Chapman applied on Federal habeas corpus, as far as I can find.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.833" offset="14753285">The standards in Jackson are completely inappropriate for this kind of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.154" offset="14778467">Jackson assumes that the jury fact-finding is untainted by any error and then looks at the result of that fact-finding to see whether that fact-finding is so out of the realm of permissibility that it has to be overturned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.414" offset="14839593">We're talking here about a case where constitutional error clearly occurred, and we submit it had a direct truth-finding relationship to the jury fact-finding, so you start off with a tainted jury determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.924" offset="14893614">How much that taint... I almost heard, and I don't think I heard correctly, but I almost heard that the question was a question of percentage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.262" offset="14926947">Did it have a 5 percent or 20 percent difference in terms of the verdict?</text>
