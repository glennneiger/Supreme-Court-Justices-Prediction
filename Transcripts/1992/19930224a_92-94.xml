            <text syncTime="11.109" offset="184973">Mr. Ball, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. William B. Ball</label>
            <text syncTime="48.493" offset="334498">Chief Justice Rehnquist, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="52.927" offset="352261">The important issue posed by this case is whether Jim Zobrest, the petitioner, a profoundly deaf boy, would have to have forsaken education in the State-qualified religious school of his parents' conscientious choice if he were to participate in a program designed by the Congress of the United States to aid the education of all handicapped children, including children in public and religious... including public and private and religious schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.937" offset="524252">Now, the courts below answered that question by saying yes, and that is the respondent's position and that of the respondent's amici.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.122" offset="561032">Now, Jim, in order to be educated, had to have the service of a certified sign language interpreter, a related service under the Education of the Handicapped Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.029" offset="604604">He had to have it on the place where his education was going to happen, and the place where his education was going to happen was Salpointe Catholic High School, a high school which meets the requirements of Arizona's compulsory attendance law and which is accredited as a college preparatory school by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.073" offset="696764">But it's also a school which is pervasively religious, and on the ground, the sole ground that to afford Jim a sign language interpreter, on the premises of a pervasively religious school, would violate the Establishment Clause, the court... the respondent school district denied him the service.</text>

            <text syncTime="164.431" offset="798224">Under the statute, could... does the statute only provide for in-kind furnishing of services?</text>
            <text syncTime="171.827" offset="827794">Would the statute not permit the parents to hire their own sign language interpreter and be reimbursed?</text>

            <text syncTime="183.084" offset="872829">We don't find any authority in the statute for the school district, for example, to have paid the parents money so they could go and hire the interpreter.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.281" offset="913685">In fact, there is a... under section 1415... the subsection I can't recall... it seems... would seem to preclude that.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.899" offset="956108">All the funds therefore... funds therefore could not be disbursed to the parents for that purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="419.395" offset="1818044">Now, the key issue, as we see it, is whether the... furnishing of an interpreter to Jim would have had a primary effect advancing religion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1230.005" offset="5060572">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.821" offset="5107801">We agree with Mr. Ball that the principal issue in this case is whether the second test from Lemon is satisfied, and we submit that the primary effect in this case of the benefit that was conferred is not to advance religion and that the second test in Lemon, therefore, would indicate that this is not an establishment of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.239" offset="5209469">I think it's useful to look at perhaps the most succinct statement of the test under Lemon, the succinct... most succinct recent statement that this Court has made, and that comes in a concurring opinion of Justice Powell... excuse me... which was joined by two other members of the Court and was endorsed by yet another two members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.046" offset="5308735">So, in a sense, it speaks for a majority of the Court in the Witters case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.860" offset="5327961">And he said, quote, State programs that are wholly neutral in offering education assistance to a class, defined without reference to religion, do not violate the second part of the Lemon test because any aid to religion results from the private choices of individual beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.225" offset="5409463">Now, that is this case, as we see it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1383.481" offset="5674449">He could... typically sign language interpreters have many occasions in which they will hear things that they disagree with and will sign them nonetheless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.210" offset="5717394">That's just part of the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.251" offset="5725545">They are not expected to agree or disagree with whatever they're signing, and they're not expected to change, by virtue of their own predilections, anything that they hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.527" offset="5762638">Now, the themes that I think that you can trace through this Court's Establishment Clause cases, in the aid to schools area at least, that we can tease out from Justice Powell's statement are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.519" offset="5834632">First, where the service is made available directly to the individual as opposed to the school, you will ordinarily not find an Establishment Clause violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.327" offset="5873816">Similarly, where there's a broad class that is the recipient of the service that is not based on religion... in this case, everyone who is the subject of a disability was a student... that also indicates no Establishment Clause problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.058" offset="5940794">Third, where the school gets no financial benefit out of the arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.221" offset="5961378">And here, I think in answer to Justice Stevens' point that the school does, after all, get the tuition, this Court has been very clear in cases going back to Everson, which was the bus transportation case, and going through the Allen case and the Mueller case, the tax deduction case, and Witters, Witters in particular, that the fact that the school gets another student and the associated tuition is not enough to constitute a primary effect for Lemon, the second part of the Lemon test, purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.862" offset="6076003">So, there's no financial benefit here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.723" offset="6087393">Salpointe is essentially in a position of just being a stakeholder with respect to the financial impact of this arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.517" offset="6118531">And finally, that... you have to ask the question of whether there is any expression of endorsement or support for the religious view that is being put forward or for religion at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.327" offset="6177776">And here again, we submit that there is neither any implicit support on the part of the State for anything that's being said here in the religious school merely by virtue of the fact that the State is providing the child a means to hear what's being said, nor is there any sense in which the State is somehow endorsing the message of Salpointe High School in general by providing an interpreter there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.324" offset="6281848">The interpreter is serving as this child's ears.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.436" offset="6294283">This interpreter is doing nothing more than performing at the State's behest the service of enabling this child to hear whatever it is that--</text>

            <text syncTime="1564.636" offset="6399086">The statute operates essentially as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.910" offset="6408176">The statute gives local educational agencies a great deal of freedom to design programs as they will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.294" offset="6441718">That may mean in some cases that the local educational agency will say we are going to provide certain services, but only in the public schools because it's just impractical to do it.</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="1606.233" offset="6565434">Well, there's a provision... the short answer is no, it wouldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.126" offset="6581003">The somewhat longer answer is there is a provision in the statute that allows what's called bypass, which is to say, if there's something about local law that generally precludes a certain type of service, then you can go directly to the Federal bypass provision and you can get aid directly from the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.069" offset="6648816">So, there is a provision in the statute that deals with that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.321" offset="6661773">But the way this case comes to the Court is that it was conceded all the way along that this service would be available to this child except for the fact that he was in a religious school and only then, not because of the choice of the school district, but only because the school district felt compelled by the Establishment Clause to say no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.536" offset="6738678">This case has been purely an Establishment Clause defense to what otherwise would be the school district's conceded acknowledgement that under their own policies they would provide the service to the child in place.</text>

            <text syncTime="1703.041" offset="6952673">The fact is the entirety of the message is going to have a religious content, a religious overlay, a religious reference, and there's no way to communicate or to hear anything without communicating or hearing the religion.</text>
