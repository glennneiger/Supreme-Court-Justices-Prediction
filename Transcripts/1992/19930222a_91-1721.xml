            <text syncTime="248.252" offset="1127804">If it were not for the standing issue, Your Honor, either party could go back to the court under the original injunction and ask the court to review this new ordinance under the same standards and under the same legal issues that were presented 4 years ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.322" offset="1368026">Was the ordinance repealed, and then a new one enacted, or was it just amended?</text>

          <turn speaker="deborah_a_ausburn" startTime="311.354" stopTime="493.122">
            <label>Ms. Deborah A. Ausburn</label>
            <text syncTime="311.354" offset="1380251">It was repealed and replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.725" offset="1389655">The beginning of the ordinance... I believe, Your Honor, at the very beginning it said that they repealed section 6 of the City of Jacksonville Purchasing Code and replaced it with this following section 6, so the... a new part section 6 is added to the code, I believe is the exact language.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.520" offset="1480875">So the new ordinance is in exactly the same place that the old one was.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.024" offset="1498847">It is part of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.326" offset="1504071">It uses the same statutory citations and for that purpose we've argued that the case is not moot on those grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.080" offset="1543150">The question upon which this Court granted certiorari, which is standing and whether a group of nonminority contractors have standing based on the pleadings that were present in this record, there have been three particular standards that have been identified to this Court for determining that standing issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.135" offset="1627369">The first one is the rule adopted by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which apparently no party before this Court is defending any longer, and that is that the contractors must identify a specific bid and a specific contract that was lost due to the enactment of the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.506" offset="1696855">The second rule that was presented is the City of Jacksonville's latest proposal, which is that the contractors need not show that we actually lost a contract, we need only show that we specifically bid for an ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.754" offset="1753802">And then the third standard is that submitted by petitioners in this case, which is that the statute creates a racial preference that disadvantages certain parties and that we are within that category of people who are disadvantaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.244" offset="1811794">We believe, Your Honors, that it is this last rule is the only one that is consistent with this Court's precedent in both standing and equal protection law.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.542" offset="1852963">As we explained in our brief, the categorical rule which petitioners would ask this Court to adopt stems from a number of cases, such as Baker v. Carr, Quinn v. Millsap and others, which is that the Equal Protection Clause protects access, it does not protect what the Eleventh Circuit asks the injury to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.155" offset="1935405">It does not protect actually getting a contract, it does not protect actually being able to perform the contract, the Equal Protection Clause protects access to the system, and that when a party does not have complete and fair access to the system, and that access is conditioned on an unconstitutional barrier, that is the injury, and that is sufficient injury for the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.348" offset="2024221">Now, the second rule, which is the latest version, has... sounds more perfectly reasonable that you have to identify a bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.606" offset="2065181">However, it is an unnecessary addition to the law of equal protection, or the law of standing, and it is not consistent with this Court's rulings in prior cases such as--</text>

            <text syncTime="495.425" offset="2116486">Is the difference between the first and the second essentially kind of an empirical difference in the sense that you're claiming that by identifying the contractors and the association as contractors who customarily bid on a range of contracts, that you therefore in effect have identified them as probably harmed, whereas the second category is asking simply for a more specific demonstration, or a more, maybe a heightened probability of harm?</text>

            <text syncTime="852.249" offset="3543817">This Court has stated that the issue in standing cases is whether you have the proper plaintiff before the Court, a plaintiff who is likely to be injured, a plaintiff who is concerned about what is happening in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="875.062" offset="3635036">After all, the ordinance is directed towards contractors who do business with the City of Jacksonville, and if we can prove we are within that category, then there is no one else that is going to be able to challenge the ordinance, other than people within that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.293" offset="3695954">The third rule is the one that this Court originally granted cert on, which is the Eleventh Circuit rule requiring proof of an actual contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.069" offset="3731062">We believe that the Eleventh Circuit confused the standards for standing in equal protection cases with the standards at issue for a bid protest or your standard civil suit where damages are sought, and for all the reasons contained in our brief we believe that injunctive relief, and particularly injunctive relief under the Equal Protection Clause, does not require proof of a specific lost contract but simply being allowed to... or, excuse me, not being considered or not being able to compete on an equal basis is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.462" offset="3868675">The finally issue that has arisen in the briefs is the level of evidence that is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.636" offset="3905351">The posture of this case is that everything about standing has been decided on the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.200" offset="3927608">There is no evidence in the record that our clients submitted a bid and were refused, or that they would have gotten a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.495" offset="3952790">The reason we believe that this Court should focus on the allegations and determine whether the allegations are sufficient for standing is because in many cases, this... or in most cases where the Court has focused on the... considered standing, they have focused on the allegations in the complaint unless, if standing came up as an issue in the lower courts, in the issue of summary judgment or in other standards, then this Court has considered that the nonmoving party or the party plaintiff who has proved standing has had adequate notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.196" offset="4075565">Celotex is an example where this Court made a point that the plaintiff in that case had not presented sufficient evidence to sustain her pleadings, but that she had sufficient notice, and all of these cases... many of these cases that the Court has considered have used language that if it is contested at trial, if the question is brought up... in Lujan, the language was, in response to a motion for summary judgment evidence is needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.505" offset="4200848">There was no such motion, there was no such notice for the petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.919" offset="4218507">The question never came up until... as I believe the briefs adequately show, the question never came up until 6 months before this case came up on appeal when the Eleventh Circuit adopted its new rule and then applied it in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.718" offset="4269707">This Court has never dismissed pleadings or never decided a case on standing for lack of evidence unless there was notice in the lower courts that this has come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.394" offset="4320385">In this case, the City of Jacksonville never raised the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.637" offset="4341283">In fact, at a hearing on the preliminary injunction when the judge asked them if they were claiming that we had no standing, they said no.</text>

            <text syncTime="3019.232" offset="12211663">The fact that the issue was raised by the court only... or the appellate court in this case, only underscores the importance of the standing doctrine to the court's lawful exercise of its authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.699" offset="12261609">The AGC in this case rushed to court after the Croson decision attempting to halt the city's program, and successfully did, without ever showing that an actual case, an actual instance where one AGC member was injured during the 5 years of the existence of the program, and they were able to get an opinion that now stands as an advisory opinion because there's no record of evidence in that record, even though the case had gone to judgment, that there is an actual case in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.372" offset="12396297">In conclusion, conclusory allegations of injury are not sufficient to establish constitutional standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.491" offset="12444780">Without allegations of specific injury, a court cannot be assured that standing is present and that it should resolve a dispute between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.357" offset="12492218">Relaxing standing doctrine would only upset the delicate balance of power among the branches of Government, expand judicial power unnecessarily, and sanction advisory opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.686" offset="12541537">The court in this case, the appellate court in this case provided a check, and if that check is not fulfilled, the legitimacy of the court can ultimately be undermined.</text>

            <text syncTime="3127.953" offset="12646550">We believe that our allegations are sufficient to show that we were excluded from contracts because of an ordinance that was adjudicated to be unconstitutional, and that we will continue to be excluded from those contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.111" offset="12695242">If this Court believes that more evidence is necessary, we are prepared, certainly, to present that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.374" offset="12716244">We would simply ask that this Court decide what it is that we must show in the lower court, whether we must show a specific contract, or whether we must show the matching contracts that the City of Jacksonville is asking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.701" offset="12761593">In the final analysis, however, we believe that in order to be consistent with prior precedent, that the correct rule in this case is the one that we have already met, which is that the City of Jacksonville has an ordinance that excludes contractors from consideration if they fit within the category, and that we, as nonminority contractors who do business with the City of Jacksonville, are within that category.</text>
