            <text syncTime="66.474" offset="398600">The Federal Circuit's practice ignores the strong public interest in resolving the invalidity issue, and finally, that the Federal Circuit should always reach the issue of validity when presented on appeal in a declaratory judgment counterclaim unless that issue becomes moot through happenstance during the appeal, or if a decision on another issue in the case completely resolves the controversy between the parties, and with respect to your question, Justice O'Connor, we believe that there is a case of controversy that has proceeded since the beginning in this case, there is a difference between the case brought by Morton on the infringement issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="109.013" offset="568814">That is decided by a very special set of facts, and Cardinal had separate, independent basis on which to assert its claim that the patent was invalid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1640.575" offset="6695051">There certainly is, and there is also a major dispute with regard to those situations in which the appellate court, the Federal Circuit, should decide validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.775" offset="6743847">I think we differ both in terms of analysis and in result, and respondent's position is quite clear, because of this Court's decision in 1971 in Blonder-Tongue, that what is required there is a fundamental right, on appeal, to decide the validity issue on the merits, and that must be done in every case because of the public interest that this Court recognized in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.500" offset="6890760">That obviously goes beyond the facts of this particular case, because as has been pointed out, this case does involve a situation in which there is a declaratory judgment action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.848" offset="6940079">In fact, it is probably the rare case in which a defendant infringer does not interpose a declaratory judgment action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.971" offset="6976651">But conceptually, the reason why the Federal Circuit should address the validity issue has nothing to do with whether there is the presence of a declaratory judgment count or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.942" offset="7032448">It's really bottomed in this Court's analysis in the Blonder-Tongue case, and it's kind of interesting to look at the position of the petitioners and the respondent in that case, because in both of their briefs, neither petitioner nor the respondent urged that the Triplett rule which was then in effect ought to be modified in any respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.982" offset="7152611">In fact, what they said is the Triplett rule should be maintained, and in this Court's Blonder-Tongue decision, it stated in petitioners' brief at page 12,</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.641" offset="7195243">"Though petitioners stand to gain by any such result, we cannot urge the destruction of a long-accepted safeguard for patentees merely for the expediency of victory. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.881" offset="7256265">And that safeguard that was referenced in that was the safeguard against an improvident judgment of invalidity, because under the Triplett rule, it really made no difference whether the patent was held valid or invalid except with respect to the particular parties, because in that setting it would be res judicata as between the particular parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.417" offset="7358352">But beyond that, if there was another party who was believed to infringe, then a second suit could be had, so that safeguard was the ability on the part of the patent owner to file multiple lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.586" offset="7423031">And what this Court decided in Blonder-Tongue was no, that is not proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.822" offset="7451975">There is a public interest in deciding validity of patents, and what should be done is to provide the patent owner with one full and fair opportunity, and respondents submit that that one full and fair opportunity inherently includes the right to a decision on appeal with respect to the merits of the validity issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2080.016" offset="8452778">But if validity is put into play, and there is a contest between that, then... by the trial court, then under our position, as respondents, Blonder-Tongue requires a consideration of the validity issue upon appeal in any instance, except for the rare situation in which, for example, a patent has expired and which, under what has been called prudential mootness, the issue of whether the patent is valid or not is so attenuated that it doesn't make any difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="2888.237" offset="11685692">I think in this case to resolve it I'm looking at the Federal Circuit practice, and I think that the answer... you were quite right that oftentimes the validity issue and infringement issue are intertwined and you have to interpret the claims, and that's something which has to be done in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.530" offset="11762806">And if that is not done, and is not done properly, it's part of what we think has occurred here, what happens is that you begin to meld the issues together, and it does affect the thinking, and so I think that that certainly has to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.980" offset="11828634">And it is a rare case in which a declaratory judgment count is not there, so in terms of result we're probably not talking about a lot of cases, but in terms of approach, what I submit is that the Blonder-Tongue decision requires a consideration of validity when the trial court exercises discretion to decide that issue, whether it's decided valid or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.071" offset="11952977">And I think anything short of that would be a retreat from the sort of principles that were nec... that were, excuse me, enunciated in Blonder-Tongue, and I think that what we've seen, that the concern about the safeguard over the 20 years, has certainly been something that has been put to rest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3124.675" offset="12631429">If prudential mootness occurs in a situation where it's a happenstance through some extrinsic fact, something which was in dispute, a report, or whatever, was issued, a bankruptcy plan which has already gone so far along in reorganization that it would be nonsensical to provide relief, those are the sorts of prudential mootness issues that come up.</text>

            <text syncTime="3174.367" offset="12830169">I think that the only thing that I would... additional point that I would like to make is that you look at this from the standpoint of the patent owner, and part of the problem when you have the Federal Circuit practice is what has occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.991" offset="12912716">You have one half of an opportunity to litigate, which is accorded to Morton in the Argus case, you have one-half of an opportunity to litigate which was accorded in the Cardinal case, and the problem is that this is one situation in which one-half of an opportunity and one-half of an opportunity does not end up to be one full opportunity, that one-half of an opportunity may satisfy the cynical patent owner who only wants to save his or her patents, but that same one-half of an opportunity only serves to wholly frustrate a responsible patent owner as Morton, who believes an erroneous trial court decision was reached and would like to have that rectified on appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3243.676" offset="13107380">I think I would just like to make two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.951" offset="13132562">First, the presumption of validity that's been discussed seems to be imbued with some substantive right by Morton.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.096" offset="13173105">It really is only a procedural device to put the burden of proof of invalidity on the person attacking the patent, and I think that should be kept in mind when you're deciding whether there is some kind of unfairness of not deciding that issue, or deciding invalidity and then not going on to reach the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.962" offset="13264533">The difference we have with Morton is that if the counterclaim, or if the invalidity is raised only as an affirmative defense, we don't believe the Court necessarily must reach that issue, and in conclusion, I believe that we would request this Court to remand the case to the Federal Circuit with the direction that they reach the issue of validity and reach the merits substantively on that issue.</text>
