            <text syncTime="8.471" offset="115631">This, in a state dispute, is before the Court under our original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.496" offset="135693">At issue are unclaimed securities distributions held by intermediaries in their own names on behalf of beneficial owners cannot be identified or located.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.231" offset="178638">New York escheated $360 million in such funds without regard to the beneficial owner's last known address or in intermediary's State of incorporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.130" offset="226285">Delaware initiated this original action alleging wrongfully escheat.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.788" offset="244885">A Special Master recommended that the right to escheat be awarded to the State of the securities issue as principal executive offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.889" offset="277276">Both Delaware and New York lodged exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.556" offset="291905">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we sustain the exceptions in part overruled the exceptions in part and remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.154" offset="326387">The State in which an intermediary is incorporated has a right to escheat in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.043" offset="345926">We would ordinarily award the right to escheat to the State in which a creditor has a last known address, but because a beneficial owners cannot be located, we award the right to escheat to the State in which each intermediary as debtor is incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.530" offset="403814">We therefore, sustain Delaware's and New York's exceptions to the Master's contrary conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.399" offset="427324">We also sustain Delaware's exception to the Master's proposal to award the right to escheat to the State in which the debtor has its principal executive offices rather than to the State in which the debtor is incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.738" offset="480718">Finally, we reject New York's claim to a right to escheat based on statistical evidence that most of the relevant creditors are brokers with New York addresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.574" offset="528052">A State wishing to claim the right to escheat must prove transaction by transaction that a particular creditor had a last known address within that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.254" offset="566713">Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Blackmun and Justice Stevens have joined.</text>
