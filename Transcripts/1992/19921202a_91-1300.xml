            <text syncTime="9.606" offset="169663">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.474" offset="181157">The question in this case is whether the Constitution prohibits a district court from enhancing a defendant's sentence under the sentencing guidelines if the Court finds that the defendant committed perjury when he testified at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.481" offset="229222">The court of appeals held that the Constitution forbids a district court from applying the guidelines in that manner, and we disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.702" offset="258061">Long before the sentencing guidelines went into effect, a district court at sentencing could take into account its belief that the defendant committed perjury when he testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.875" offset="290766">Nothing in the sentencing guidelines alters that long-settled rule or justifies the conclusion that the Constitution now demands that a different balance must be struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.747" offset="330264">Respondent was a member of an organization responsible for distributing cocaine in Charleston, West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.985" offset="355237">The Government's evidence, which consisted largely of the eyewitness testimony of respondent's former confederates, showed that respondent was responsible for purchasing powdered cocaine, manufacturing it into crack cocaine, and then selling the crack.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.577" offset="409571">Respondent's defense at trial was simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.779" offset="418348">As the court of appeals put it, respondent took the stand and denied everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.064" offset="435485">The district court, however, credited the Government's evidence and convicted respondent of conspiracy to traffic in drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.385" offset="460771">At sentencing the district court found that respondent had committed perjury when she testified at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.456" offset="481042">The district court's finding is at page 29 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.241" offset="496193">Based on that finding, the district court concluded that sentencing guidelines section 3C1.1 required a two-point enhancement to the base offense level.</text>

            <text syncTime="106.168" offset="555962">The case law makes that point so that a person who perjures herself at trial has willfully obstructed or attempted to obstruct justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="115.840" offset="594623">Because he didn't say that she was convicted of... that she committed perjury in so many words, did he?</text>
            <text syncTime="122.362" offset="620745">He said she should be assessed with a two-point addition for obstruction of justice by reason of her trial testimony, she was untruthful at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.282" offset="648435">He doesn't anywhere say that she committed perjury, did he?</text>

            <text syncTime="133.335" offset="664631">He doesn't, I think, use that precise term at page 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.270" offset="676334">But he does assess her the two point enhancement because he found that she was untruthful at trial with respect to material matters in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.126" offset="707785">And that, we think, is a sufficient finding to justify the enhancement under that guideline.</text>

            <text syncTime="161.755" offset="778316">--Correct... correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.355" offset="780719">And I would like to make that point very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.106" offset="791691">It's not our position that a district court either should or can enhance a defendant's sentence simply because the defendant was convicted after testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.895" offset="830874">The district court must make a finding that the defendant committed perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.532" offset="849369">That finding cannot be based simply on the jury's verdict of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.484" offset="865251">The court, under this guideline as under the other guidelines that are now in place in the Federal system, has the fact-finding responsibility to decide whether enhancements are appropriate once the court calculates the base offense level.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.328" offset="916556">In making that finding, the district court is entitled to consider all of the evidence, since both the Sentencing Reform Act and the sentencing guidelines direct district courts to consider all of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.199" offset="956053">But the district court must make an independent finding in this regard and that, we think, is an adequate response to many of the concerns that otherwise might be raised about this guideline.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.139" offset="995864">The court of appeals believed that the application of the guideline and the way the district court conducted it rendered the guideline unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.895" offset="1022822">The court of appeals therefore held that the sentence had to be set aside and the case vacated and remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.465" offset="1049153">In the course of its ruling, the court of appeals expressly rejected the contrary conclusion that had been adopted by numerous other courts of appeals, eight in number now, and we believe that in so doing the Fourth Circuit erred.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.607" offset="1093666">Historically, the criminal law found it important to allow a sentencing judge to consider a broad range of information, including prior misconduct by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.962" offset="1131073">In fact, prior misconduct was deemed so probative and so weighty that a district court at sentencing was entitled to consider such evidence even in the absence of a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.250" offset="1168272">Among the types of misconduct that a court could consider at sentencing was the defendant's perjury at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.055" offset="1187498">In 1978 in the case of United States v. Grayson, this Court endorsed that practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.792" offset="1210381">The Court at the same time also rejected the argument that allowing a trial judge to consider his firsthand observations of the defendant's perjury would amount to punishing the defendant for an uncharged crime or would deter other defendants from taking the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.968" offset="1271090">The background principles of law against which Grayson was decided are still vital today.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.205" offset="1296063">When the guidelines went into effect on November 1 of 1987, those principles were not changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.193" offset="1316020">In fact, the Court in cases has made clear that those principles are still valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.311" offset="1336500">For example, in the last two terms in the Payne and Dawson cases, the Court has made clear that a district court at sentencing is entitled to consider a broad range of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.751" offset="1374221">In addition, in the case of Nix v. Whiteside the Court has made clear the defendant's right to testify does not include the right to give false testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.940" offset="1407031">The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 and the sentencing guidelines embrace those principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.177" offset="1427929">As I mentioned to Justice Kennedy, both the act and the guidelines direct the district courts to consider a broad range of evidence at sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.699" offset="1458022">And in particular, the guideline they were concerned with here today, section 3(c)1.1, directs the district courts to enhance a defendant's sentence if the court finds that the defendant committed perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.472" offset="1501176">That guideline therefore serves as the vehicle through which the Sentencing Commission and, in each case, the district court can implement the principle that this Court approved in Grayson.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.661" offset="1537957">Now, the Fourth Circuit held that that guideline unconstitutionally infringed on the defendant's right to testify and gave several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.600" offset="1565646">We think none of those reasons are sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.984" offset="1575155">To begin with, the court of appeals was troubled by the fact that section 3(c)1.1 classifies a defendant's false trial testimony as the obstruction of justice rather than as simply one factor that a district court can consider or ignore in the exercise of its sentencing discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.895" offset="1642864">The label used to describe this factor, however, should be immaterial because the label has no independent effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.215" offset="1668151">In addition, the guideline is not a disguised means of punishing the defendant for a crime not charged against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.988" offset="1695214">A defendant who testifies perjuriously at trial thereby indicates his willingness to break the law when he finds it in his interest to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.742" offset="1726247">That factor therefore shows the defendant is a greater danger to the community than might otherwise be the case, and therefore in turn is relevant to the question of what period of incarceration is necessary to incapacitate him for the protection of society.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.401" offset="1784866">The court of appeals also believed that because this guideline is mandatory, it amounts to the type of wooden or reflex enhancement that this Court criticized in Grayson.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.292" offset="1824468">While it is true that Grayson did not direct the district courts in every case to enhance a defendant's sentence if the court found that the defendant committed perjury, Grayson at the same time did not prohibit Congress or the Sentencing Commission from making the judgment across the board that a defendant's trial perjury is an aggravating factor and should be treated as such in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.373" offset="1908791">That is precisely what section 3(c)1.1 does.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.424" offset="1924987">There is also nothing unusual about codifying this rule or others like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.328" offset="1944526">The sentencing guidelines codify numerous sentencing factors that prior law had left to the individual discretion of district court judges in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.334" offset="1980575">The new mandatory nature of these rules is just the inevitable result of making the choice to target a district court's attention to certain matters deemed aggravating or mitigating and to guide the district court by giving weight to those factors, instead of leaving to each court in each case the authority to make that decision for himself or herself.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.729" offset="2062182">If a district court, however, can consider defendant's perjury at trial, and we know from Grayson that it can, a district court then can be channeled in the exercise of that discretion by Congress or the sentencing commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.388" offset="2112859">The court of appeals also believed that, again, because this guideline is mandatory, it would deter innocent defendants from testifying, especially defendants with prior convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.511" offset="2149326">We think that's unlikely.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.177" offset="2156014">A defendant who goes to trial has as his overriding concern avoiding a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.515" offset="2177330">A defendant therefore will decide whether to testify based on his assessment of the likelihood that his testimony will increase the prospects of his acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.437" offset="2208990">In making that judgment a defendant will rely on various factors, such as the strength of the Government's case, the strength of the other defense evidence available, the defendant's prior record or other factors that may be used to impeach him, his credibility as a witness, and his ability to withstand cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.165" offset="2279939">We think it would be a rare case in which a defendant, after balancing all those factors, concludes that he should testify in order to increase his chances of an acquittal, but then nonetheless decides against doing so because of his fear that the jury would erroneously believe he is committing perjury, would therefore erroneously convict him, and that the district court then erroneously would make the same conclusion and enhance his sentence under this guideline.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.114" offset="2383697">The Fourth Circuit expressed skepticism that the district courts could or would apply this guideline properly and that courts of appeals could or would police the actions of the district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.671" offset="2425911">We see no reason to be pessimistic in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.373" offset="2436778">As I mentioned before, the guideline requires that a defendant's sentence be enhanced if the court makes the finding, independent of the jury's verdict, that the defendant committed perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.165" offset="2479932">The district court, therefore, has this responsibility at sentencing, like many of the other responsibilities district courts now have under the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.319" offset="2512533">We have no fear that the district courts and the courts of appeals will not be able to apply this guideline in the correct manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.925" offset="2538969">In fact, this Court in Grayson expressed no fear that district courts would misuse the sentencing authority that was recognized in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.994" offset="2571256">In Grayson the Court recognized that a judge's oath of office and a judge's integrity would be a sufficient guarantee that district courts may not misuse this factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.683" offset="2610022">We see no reason today, now, simply because the guidelines are in... in effect, to have any less confidence in the ability of district courts properly to conduct the sentencing proceedings than this Court did back in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.591" offset="2657669">I'd like to reserve the balance of--</text>

            <text syncTime="660.343" offset="2772608">The one court you're referring to is a Third Circuit case called Kikamora.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.879" offset="2786819">In that case what in essence happened was a defendant's sentence was increased from a guidelines range of 30 months to up within the statutory range of about 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.418" offset="2824957">And what the Third Circuit said was when you have a situation where the increase is that great, it would be appropriate to apply a greater standard to ensure that the facts are found in a proper manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="694.231" offset="2908236">The Third Circuit, in fact, mentioned in that case that it hadn't seen it in other cases, I believe, and certainly no other court since then has applied that more stringent standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.337" offset="2940628">So we believe that in accordance with the Court's jurisprudence, the preponderance standard is sufficient.</text>

            <label>Mr. Brent E. Beveridge</label>
            <text syncTime="817.925" offset="3402995">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="822.644" offset="3421803">The purpose of me being here today is to assert that the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals properly decided that there was a chilling effect on the Fifth Amendment right to testify on one's own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.255" offset="3492334">And the Fourth Circuit in this instance basically said why it had a chilling effect, and... when you consider all the factors that are involved in determining whether a defendant should testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.431" offset="3544997">Basically, I'm here to assert and tell you why the... or how the chilling effect takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.335" offset="3576553">And if you look at Grayson, which is the key case originally decided on the right of the court to consider those as an aggravating factor, the defendant's perjured testimony at trial, you can see in there that there is a reference to the case of Hummelway v. Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.998" offset="3655233">Which basically says... in a footnote in Hummelway v. Arkansas, is that the counsel for the defendant has an obligation to court... to the court, to present testimony that is true or accurate or reasonable, and counsel has made an effort to determine whether or not the defendant is testifying to perjurious events.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.518" offset="3769336">And in this instance, what we have is a case where the burden on counsel in this instance... and this goes to the very roots of effective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.325" offset="3820536">Counsel presents testimony at trial and before your client testifies you go to your client and basically say, you know, these are the things that you should consider before you testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.585" offset="3873617">And under the guideline in this instance, that if it's applied with an automatic enhancement, as it was in this case, for perjured testimony, you're going to have to advise your client that if you take the stand and you lose, effectively you're going to get a two-level enhancement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2788.102" offset="11283720">One is I would like to correct an answer I gave to Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.920" offset="11294900">Justice Kennedy asked me would the enhancement be applicable at allocution because the defendant would normally not be sworn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.110" offset="11323739">And it's true the defendant normally would not be sworn at allocution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.562" offset="11337532">In this case, however, if you look at page 6 of the joint appendix you'll see that the defendant was sworn at the outset of the sentencing proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.316" offset="11364491">Plus, under the 1992 version of the guidelines, if you look to page 248, you will see that one of the comments by the Sentencing Commission gives as an example of instances in which the... the guideline could be applied, quote, providing materially false information to a judge or magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.593" offset="11433663">And that is... does not exclude the allocution stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.081" offset="11451635">And secondly, in response to Justice Stevens' question, it can be the case that a false statement to a police officer could lead to this enhancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.418" offset="11480892">Again, if you look to the same volume as the 1992 edition and again to page 248, you'll see that another comment by the Sentencing Commission reads as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.924" offset="11514956">Another example would be providing a materially false statement to a law enforcement officer that significantly obstructed or impeded the official investigation or prosecution of the instant offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.898" offset="11558842">Now that doesn't mean every false statement; there are the qualifications, material and significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.033" offset="11579426">But with those two qualifications it could apply in that circumstance.</text>
