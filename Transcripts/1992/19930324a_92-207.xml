            <text syncTime="11.079" offset="182430">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.122" offset="194550">This case calls on the Court to address the dimension of the so-called Fourth Amendment Rule of Standing as it applies to a drug-smuggling conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.780" offset="237182">The case comes from the Ninth Circuit on certiorari, and began when there was a stop on the highway between Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona, of a man... Luis Arciniega... who was transporting a large quantity of cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.840" offset="297473">The traffic stop has since been found to be an invalid stop, and we haven't challenged that, the validity of the stop in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.108" offset="338537">What happened after the stop was that about... so far as the record reflects, about 5 minutes into the stop Mr. Arciniega consented to the search of the trunk of the car and the officers immediately found 560 pounds of cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.659" offset="400709">Mr. Arciniega then cooperated with the investigation and that led to the arrest of each of the respondents and others, and they were all charged with conspiracy and various substantive counts under the drug control statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.236" offset="446998">The district court found first that the stop was invalid and second that each of the respondents had standing to object to the stop of Arciniega's car and the search of the trunk that led to the drugs, and then further found that the rest of the investigation had followed from those discoveries and therefore that the evidence with respect to the defendants had to be suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.632" offset="548562">The court of appeals on the Government's appeal affirmed in major part.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.305" offset="571341">The court held with respect to respondent Xavier Padilla and with respect to the two Simpsons that the district court's ruling was correct, relying principally on what we will call the joint venture exception to the standing rule, the joint venture application of the standing principle, and with respect to Maria and George Padilla the court said that a remand was necessary to determine whether they had standing under this exception, and with respect to the remaining respondent the court said that he did not have the standing of this exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.381" offset="727553">The court's rationale essentially was that because the Simpsons</text>
            <text syncTime="152.216" offset="746988">"had an interest in the car and also had a supervisory or control relationship with respect to the conspiracy and the activities of the conspiracy on the day of the stop, that they had standing, and because Xavier Padilla again, like the Simpsons, had a supervisory or control relationship within the conspiracy with respect to the transportation, that he had standing to object to the stop of the car.

            <text syncTime="216.170" offset="1002779">The Ninth Circuit referred to the expectation of privacy, but they were clearly talking about both privacy and property interests that were affected by the stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.148" offset="1050635">There's discussion throughout the Ninth Circuit's opinion, even though they use the term expectation of privacy, which isn't precisely the right nomenclature, but they use that term to describe what they clearly meant to say was at issue here, which was both the Simpsons' ownership of the car and therefore the effect of both the stop and the ensuing search on the rights, the Fourth Amendment rights in general of the Simpsons, and also the ownership interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2034.352" offset="8275478">In Jacobsen, this Court recognized that the issue of seizure turns on property rights, not right to privacy, and that was made even more clear by Justice White's recent opinion in Soldal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2784.138" offset="11274648">Absolutely not, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.180" offset="11278828">We are not saying that Mr. Arciniega's consent, assuming, number 1 the validity of the initial seizure of the car, and number 2 assuming the, on its merits, if you will, validity of the consent, is not binding on anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.411" offset="11331700">It would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.881" offset="11333581">It would be binding on everyone else who claimed an ownership or possessory interest in the car, but the vice of your hypothetical is that it assumes two facts that are not in this case, one a finding of validity of the initial seizure, number 2, some type of ruling on the merits in favor of the Government in the issue of consent, neither of which exist in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.203" offset="11406933">But clearly, if we assume those two things, the person who is driving the car, who is properly empowered to drive it, can issue a consent under this Court's prior decisions that is binding on anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.990" offset="11449982">That is not at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.492" offset="11456043">The point that I was making that the prior case law of this Court clearly establishes that one may be absent and still have the right to complain about a seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.520" offset="11496167">The issue of absence clearly more appropriately affects the issue of right to privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.723" offset="11516960">Simply put, if I have an interest in property and someone trespasses on that property, whether or not I know about it or I am present, I still have an interest that has been offended, an interest that would give me a right to complain about that, and it is no different when one considers standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.082" offset="11582371">The Government makes much to do in the written briefs filed in this case concerning the issue of minimal intrusion versus more than minimal intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.689" offset="11620823">Traditionally, this Court has analyzed the issue of minimal intrusion versus more than minimal intrusion as to the level of finding that the Government has to make, the kind of showing they have to make to justify the initial seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.498" offset="11672023">If it is merely a minimal intrusion and counterplayed against a strong prevailing Governmental interest, then the kind of showing the Government has to make is merely reasonable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.684" offset="11716849">If it is more than a minimal intrusion, probable cause is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.116" offset="11734508">What the Government seeks to do here is bootstrap that argument to the next level, and what they seek to do is say that in the case of a minimal intrusion no articulable objective facts need be shown, not even reasonable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.177" offset="11790828">That really is the thrust of their argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.290" offset="11799187">It is important to recognize that in this case the record is very clear and unequivocal that there was no fact, no specific articulable fact, that could support the initial detention of the car in this case, so the Government wants to take the minimal cases to the next level, which, I would submit, is simply not justified on the facts of this case or any prior precedent in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.953" offset="11881839">If we look at the issue of whether or not this is a case limited to a seizure, then the joint venture rule as it determines one's right to privacy has no place in the analysis, and what the Ninth Circuit may have done is the same thing that the Seventh Circuit did in Soldal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.764" offset="11949130">It has improperly considered one's right to privacy in determining the propriety of a seizure rather than a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.999" offset="11982044">This case is a seizure case, and hopefully Soldal, as it did in the Seventh Circuit, will clear up this issue and provide guidance to counsel and courts that the proper measure of inquiry is not right to privacy but is, instead, property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.887" offset="12033662">This is a seizure case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.628" offset="12040559">If the Court has no other questions, I thank the Court.</text>
