            <text syncTime="89.408" offset="499985">They do not forbid killing, they forbid sacrifice, and indeed, these ordinances do not forbid any physical act as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.914" offset="541990">All the prohibitions depend in part upon an analysis of the purposes or motives of the actor, and when the analysis is complete, the religious motive is always forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.137" offset="586921">But I think what is most revealing about these ordinances is that they are written on the assumption that animal sacrifice is unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.327" offset="615655">The city's brief says it's unnecessary, the State Attorney General's opinion says it's unnecessary, all of the city's amici say it is unnecessary, and lack of necessity is an element of the offense in three of the four ordinances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1729.038" offset="7058496">We believe that the nature of the animal sacrifice problem begins all the way from the point in which the animals are possessed for the purposes of animal sacrifice, that the evidence at the district court level was that the inhumane treatment to the animals, which is one of the problems that we cite, begins at that point, and that enforcement is almost impossible because the botanicas and other farms that sell these animals, you have a quickly moving problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.338" offset="7155672">Enforcement is very difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.305" offset="7163613">More importantly, with respect to the possession of the animals during the sacrifice, there is no evidence that you can solve all of the problems in a house, in a private residence, with respect to a quiltwork of ordinances designed to regulate everything that goes on in that private residence from the standpoint of how many animals you have in that residence, how many... how they can be killed, what you do with the blood cauldrons, how you have to hold the knife.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.791" offset="7277507">Then you have problems associated with the disposal of the animals, and that the religions oftentimes mandate they be left in public places.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.595" offset="7304779">The point is that with respect to effectively solving the problems, it is our position that, 1) you couldn't solve all the problems with a series of ordinances, and 2) that the nature of the kind of entanglement that you would be getting involved in as a result of passing this patchwork of ordinances would itself cause a constitutionality problem of entanglement with the religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.561" offset="7400596">Finally, the kind of ordinances that would be required to deal with this problem even to begin approaching effectiveness... and we contend the city is not required constitutionally to enact a large number of ordinances which still don't solve the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.220" offset="7459214">But assuming that you did enact a large number of ordinances, it's our position that they would be back in court saying you've in effect prohibited us from doing what we need to do in our religion, because now you have told us how we have to hold our knives, how we have to kill them, how we have to handle the blood in the particular ceremonies, and how we have to dispose of the animals, and our gods say that's not what we can do, and therefore we would have the same problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.138" offset="7566943">We'd be back here with a different type of argument, but with the same kind of argument that the regulatory framework that we had created effectively precluded them from practicing their religion, and that is the problem that the city was facing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2033.771" offset="8277474">But I think that there's a second separate ground that doesn't even require a Smith analysis and conclusion of neutrality, which is simply that we had substantial compelling governmental interests that justified the particular ordinances at hand, and we mentioned at the trial court and we argued that the human health hazards are substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.768" offset="8365454">The human health hazards, which I want to get back to a for a moment... when you talk about killing of large numbers of animals, and blood and goat heads being present in a community where people live, in residence areas, you are dealing, according to the expert testimony, with a problem of creating vectors for disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.996" offset="8438388">These vectors come about because in an area where you have animal parts or blood in residential areas, you create harborages for rats, who generally like to travel only within 150 feet of their particular food supplies.</text>
