            <text syncTime="14.871" offset="196356">Mr. Fried.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="16.533" offset="202939">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.644" offset="215477">This is a case of implied preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.506" offset="226867">The court of appeals held that a public owner developing its property may not support a agreement between its construction manager and a council of local unions, an agreement of the sort specifically authorized by sections 8(e) and 8(f) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.320" offset="318086">The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, one of the petitioners here, is under Federal court order to complete a massive and complicated construction project.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.718" offset="363748">The Authority, as any public or private owner with a similar task, has engaged the services of a construction industry specialist, here Kaiser Engineering, another of the petitioners, to schedule and plan the tasks to be performed, to supervise the contractors performing those tasks, and to establish a labor relations regime for the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.251" offset="501884">Accordingly, Kaiser did propose to the Authority that the labor relations regime here should be one which is quite common on such projects, a project labor agreement, which is an agreement with all of the unions that usually supply crafts to such a project in return for exclusive representational rights for all workers on the projects irrespective of their contracting and subcontracting relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.128" offset="613374">The contractors and eventually the owner of the project get the benefit of stable costs, stable labor costs throughout the life of the project, and security against the kinds of labor disruptions that are caused by lawful labor activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.654" offset="691428">Kaiser proposed such an arrangement to the Authority, which approved the proposal, and accordingly Kaiser negotiated and signed the agreement with the unions here.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="150.688" offset="739598">At that point I suppose the Authority was bound by the contract?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_fried" startTime="156.234" stopTime="161.568">
            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="156.234" offset="761750">The Authority was not a signatory to the contract.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="161.568" offset="783170">I know.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.738" offset="783797">I know, but they, I suppose Kaiser was its agent.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_fried" startTime="166.954" stopTime="235.223">
            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="166.954" offset="804695">Well, a great point is made of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.508" offset="814831">Nowhere is that said.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.448" offset="822668">On some copies of the cover of the agreement, and that is reprinted in one of the appendices, it said that this was done on behalf of the Authority, and that of course is quite true.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.067" offset="877107">The Authority is the ultimate party that stands to benefit from this.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.200" offset="901662">However, it is nowhere stated that Kaiser is an agent, nor is Kaiser, I'm sorry, that the Authority is an agent, nor is the Authority a signatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.458" offset="942726">In these connections of course these contracts are read in such a way as to assure their validity, and Kaiser is a sophisticated and a frequent player in this particular arena and of course it had every intention to be bound.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.863" offset="1020258">It is not at all clear whether the Authority would have been bound by virtue of the contract itself, by virtue of that project labor agreement itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.379" offset="1058397">It is quite clear that Kaiser is bound, it is quite clear that Kaiser is a signatory.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="235.223" stopTime="249.355">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="235.223" offset="1077727">Well, why wouldn't it be bound?</text>
            <text syncTime="235.684" offset="1079608">Why wouldn't the Authority be bound if they approved in advance the negotiation of this contract and Kaiser had been hired as its, for the purpose of managing labor relations, among other things?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_fried" startTime="249.355" stopTime="325.666">
            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="249.355" offset="1134256">Well, perhaps it would have been bound, and if it would be bound it might be subject to suit under section 301 to enforce that contract, but that would not in any way affect its validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.468" offset="1214713">Now, in order to make the arrangement an effective one because of Massachusetts' competitive bidding laws the Authority included adherence to the arrangement as a bid specification.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.422" offset="1298514">The National Labor Relations Board in another proceeding, the district court in this proceeding, as well as the panel of the court of appeals and the court of appeals en banc all agreed that this was a valid labor agreement under sections 8(e) and 8(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="307.314" offset="1366119">The court of appeals found, however, that the specific action of the Authority in including adherence to the arrangement as a bid specification improperly intervened in labor relations, and therefore that that action was preempted.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="325.666" stopTime="336.643">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="325.666" offset="1439471">Well, does that turn, that decision turn on whether the Authority was acting as a proprietor or as a regulator?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_fried" startTime="336.643" stopTime="428.346">
            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="336.643" offset="1483461">In our view it ought to turn on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.276" offset="1493910">In the view of the court of appeals it does not, and we think that that is a serious mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.343" offset="1518256">The doctrine of implied preemption in general gives a court of, gives a court the authority to intervene in and to invalidate the action of the state only if what the state has done in some way contradicts a policy of Federal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.915" offset="1600490">But the policy of Federal legislation here is to leave the choice of a project labor agreement open as an option, so that what the Authority did here was not in any way to contradict that policy but in fact to utilize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.539" offset="1671020">Now, under the Machinists doctrine, which is the specific head of labor preemption on which the court of appeals relied, the rule often repeated by this Court is that a state may not seek to regulate that which the labor laws indicate must remain free for the play of labor market forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.774" offset="1771957">But if a state is not to supply all of its needs directly, if it is to enter the market as a purchaser, then it is inevitable that some line, such as the line between the state as a participant in the market and the state as a regulator, be drawn.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="428.346" offset="1850220">Can the state be a regulator just by virtue of its use of its spending power?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="438.755" offset="1891912">And the test is a test which I will draw from what this Court said in the New York Telephone case, what is the scope, purport, and impact of what the state has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.572" offset="1947187">Simply the fact that it uses its spending power is not a sufficient condition to get it out from under labor preemption, of course not.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.400" offset="1986475">But in this case the scope, purport, and impact of what the state did was precisely tailored to its needs as a proprietor.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.269" offset="2029943">It did nothing that a private party faced with the same problems would not have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.162" offset="2057528">It's very striking how narrowly tailored the project labor agreement in this case is to the specific needs of this project.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.548" offset="2095040">These agreements often require all contractors coming on the job to be union signatory generally in all their work for the life of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.265" offset="2141956">This agreement does not require that.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.847" offset="2152196">This agreement only requires that the contractors accept union representation on this job.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.564" offset="2183125">That is how narrowly tailored the Authority's action is to serve its narrow proprietary interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.292" offset="2218024">Another way of putting it--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="521.832" stopTime="538.623">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="521.832" offset="2224189">Mr. Fried, suppose a state decides that it wants to assure all its contracts a degree of security so it provides that all state contracting must be done with union contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.143" offset="2289391">Would that be valid?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_fried" startTime="538.623" stopTime="582.374">
            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="538.623" offset="2291376">--On an appropriate record with appropriate findings that might be valid, yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.838" offset="2316245">I could not say in a blanket way that under no circumstances would such a, would such a labor policy be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.325" offset="2354174">But there is a great difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.576" offset="2363161">The difficulty is to show that something that is that comprehensive, that reaches beyond the needs of a particular project nevertheless serves proprietary interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.916" offset="2416555">I would not want to say a priori that that showing could never be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.842" offset="2440170">But that showing need not be made here because of the very narrowness of what the state did.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="582.374" stopTime="594.533">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="582.374" offset="2466397">Would you look to the, just the face of the law in question or do we have to investigate the intent of the legislators in each case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_fried" startTime="594.533" stopTime="670.290">
            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="594.533" offset="2514984">The motive inquiry is absolutely unnecessary to such a thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.528" offset="2534942">What's necessary is the purport of the action on its face, and its impact and its scope as it deals with those conditions revealed in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.586" offset="2587187">The perfect contrast is with the Gould case.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.858" offset="2600248">In the Gould case the state was using its spending power, it was talking about how it would make purchases, but it is simply implausible, as this Court said, to connect up what the state did with any proprietary concerns that the state might have had.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.261" offset="2677884">And that's the sort of inquiry which should be had, and it's an entirely familiar inquiry for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.388" offset="2702439">It engages in it in all sorts of contexts without getting tangled up into inquiries into subjective motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.882" offset="2728352">Just last term in the context of foreign sovereign immunity the Court distinguished between a foreign government acting as a regulator for the market on one hand or acting as a, in the Court's words, a player in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.364" offset="2794285">Now what we're saying is here the Authority was clearly acting as a player in the market.</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_fried" startTime="675.315" stopTime="702.653">
            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="675.315" offset="2838067">That is a, that is an easier distinction to make because in the Golden State case the state had no proprietary interests in play at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.323" offset="2886132">It was not a proprietor of any of the parties involved or any of the interests or any of the properties involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.558" offset="2911105">So the Golden State case, of which a great deal is made in the court of appeals, seems to us to be really quite irrelevant.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="702.653" offset="2947468">If that distinction is the proper one.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>

            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="708.628" offset="2971396">Well, we believe it is, and we certainly rely on it, and I would draw the Court's attention to the fact that if there is no such distinction then the Machinists doctrine cuts in a most unpredictable and I would think devastating way into the room for maneuver of a state when it is not supplying its own needs but is acting as a purchaser, supplies its needs by purchasing them on the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.767" offset="3087902">So I think some such distinction is absolutely necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.380" offset="3102321">There is talk in the court of appeals, rather glancing talk, and in the respondents' brief and in some of their amici brief to another head of preemption, Garmon preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.341" offset="3166165">Now, Garmon preemption deals principally with situations where a state seeks to either supplement or contradict the exclusive jurisdiction of the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.088" offset="3213185">Needless to say, nothing of that sort is present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.400" offset="3226455">It is also, obtains as a form of preemption where the state seeks to limit rights granted under section 7 of the act, and in paragraph 34 of their complaint the respondents, plaintiffs did claim that the rights of workers to be represented or not to be represented by unions of their choice were in some way interfered with by the state's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.898" offset="3328437">But that argument viciously begs the question since those section 7 rights are explicitly qualified by the rights of section 8(e) and 8(f).</text>

            <text syncTime="1147.661" offset="4727451">Oh, not in any sense, and it doesn't really have any direct bearing on it whatsoever other than to just show that purchasers of construction services have the option to decide how they want to order labor relations on construction projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.922" offset="4788578">I'd like to speak first to the issue of whether this is something that Congress would have intended the state to enter into.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.818" offset="4824104">In this preemption case we have the benefit of being able to look at the interests that are at stake here and see that Congress has in 8(e) and 8(f) balanced these very same interests and concluded that the interests of the purchaser in achieving labor peace on a construction project throughout the duration of that project are to be given priority over the interests of suppliers who prefer to do business with a non-union work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.689" offset="4939565">We don't in any way suggest that those, that the interests of employees and suppliers to work on a non-union basis are not important, they are, but Congress weighed those interests, those interests of doing business in that form against the interests of achieving labor stability, and it included that suppliers, that the supplier's interests had to be subordinated to the preferences of the purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.103" offset="5037263">So here in this case we have precisely the analogous situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.965" offset="5052728">We have the state as the purchaser of construction services having concluded in response to economic forces that it needed a project labor agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.352" offset="5090240">And there is a factual finding in this case, unlike the line drawing that might occur in some future cases, in this case the district court specifically found that the purpose of this agreement was to obtain labor stability due to the fact that the unions have legitimate market power in the Massachusetts area, and that in order to get labor peace it needed to use this arrangement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1313.294" offset="5390021">Then it would be fair to conclude that that's the type of conduct, the same kind of commercial activity that Congress intended to permit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1792.746" offset="7307827">It says there must be free and open competition, the exact opposite of what the state agency has achieved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.081" offset="7333218">Instead the MWRA went ahead and approved this and then put the bid specification into place.</text>

            <text syncTime="2009.243" offset="8173838">There are two answers to that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.695" offset="8179585">First is it's not a large hole at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.558" offset="8187108">We have not raised any objection about the state establishing all kinds of conditions, whatever they deem necessary to complete their project on time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.543" offset="8218978">It is done all the time with all kinds of stabilization agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.516" offset="8234965">The only very narrow thing that is prohibited is for them to tell contractors that they must have a union agreement and thereby force their employees to join unions, which is not something that is in fact necessary to achieve the completion of the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.026" offset="8288986">But perhaps the best place to look is to the statute and to what Congress said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.869" offset="8304346">Congress made no attempt to create this special exception for the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.523" offset="8322945">And in fact the uniform state law based on the state court decisions that we did cite in our brief and were not responded to by the other side, in the 1950's was this was beyond the pale for state governments to engage in this kind of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.790" offset="8372055">The several activities when it was raised to the state court they said no, you cannot as a state discriminate on the basis of union activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.735" offset="8407791">And presumably Congress, aware of that law, uniform law throughout the states, made no effort to change the law in the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.132" offset="8441332">It seems likely then, the legislative history shows, that Congress meant for the situation to stay exactly as it was and as it has been for the years since.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.266" offset="8477903">Because notwithstanding these arguments that we have seen in some of these briefs, these types of project agreements are quite rare in the Government sector, and they are not all that common in the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.897" offset="8524401">We represent an association that performs work on hundreds of thousands of projects around the country, next to unions, working with unions, and some non-union, some mixed, and these projects manage to get built.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.086" offset="8569228">We put, in the record is a stabilization agreement that shows how the Maryland harbor tunnel was built with no union only requirement in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.200" offset="8601619">So the fact is that the states could achieve their legitimate objectives if they have them in connection with procurements without getting into the illegitimate sphere of prohibited interference with the collective bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.009" offset="8652924">Again, as long as the Court recalls that that is the basic principle of preemption, that the states should stay out of dictating collective bargaining agreements, everything else from this case logically achieves our result.</text>

            <text syncTime="2301.895" offset="9344437">We weren't permitted to negotiate about how many days it would take for someone to have to join the union, that's already established.</text>

            <text syncTime="2319.669" offset="9415490">So what we have here is with the starting point of the interference, direct, uncontested interference with the bargaining process, in fact elimination of the bargaining process.</text>
