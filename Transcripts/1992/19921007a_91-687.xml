            <text syncTime="80.168" offset="457804">Subsequently the Montara Supreme Court vacated that sentence and remanded back to the district court, where the defendant was sentenced to 5 years at Montana State Prison with no condition for treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1215.960" offset="5001020">The state intended from the beginning to provide treatment and not punishment, and it's obvious that there was no realistic threat of future prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.057" offset="5041353">As a result the defendant was not being compelled in a criminal case to be a witness against himself, and as a result of that the Fifth Amendment has no application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.202" offset="5073954">The revocation of probation in this instance as well, and as again Murphy points out, is not a penalty that triggers Fifth Amendment protections because the sought after admission was relevant to his probationary status and posed no realistic threat of incrimination in a separate criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.397" offset="5154725">The sentence of imprisonment was already imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.039" offset="5165382">The outer boundary of punishment was established, and then leniency was offered upon the condition that Imlay would complete sex offender treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.714" offset="5204044">The burden was therefore upon him to demonstrate his continued entitlement to that probation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1274.401" offset="5234764">But making that choice did not trigger the protections of the Fifth Amendment because his decision to refuse to accept responsibility did not enhance or augment his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.147" offset="5277813">The defendant's sentence didn't change, only the conditions of the sentence changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.399" offset="5298816">There was no increase in the severity of that sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.942" offset="5312922">Only the added benefit of probation was changed because of the state's obligation to provide safety and security as well as rehabilitation and treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.759" offset="5352210">The state has to have, as this Court noted in Murphy, that kind of authority to ask questions relevant to its responsibilities and to take actions against a defendant whose refusal to answer impedes the discharge of those responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.310" offset="5418457">Extending leniency to one who is willing to cooperate is what was attempted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.564" offset="5443430">It's not a case where the sentence of a defendant who has committed no additional offense was augmented because of his or her reliance upon the protections of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.380" offset="5486689">Imlay testified, as I mentioned, at trial, and responded during sex offender treatment in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.517" offset="5519289">In both instances he denied the crime, but he did so voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.653" offset="5539769">In other words he did not remain silent and he did not claim his Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.085" offset="5561503">Because the denial was voluntary and not compelled in both instances, within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment the district court was free to rely on the defendant's denial in revoking probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.795" offset="5608315">The revocation occurred on the basis of voluntary statements by Imlay in which he denied the sexual assault.</text>

            <text syncTime="2018.951" offset="8212932">So the issue was not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.573" offset="8219515">The only language I find is this, the result may be different, we said, the result may be different if the questions put to the probationer, however relevant to his probationary status, call for answers that would incriminate him in a pending or later criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.826" offset="8296524">There is thus a substantial basis in our cases for concluding that if the state either expressly or, blah, blah, blah.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.911" offset="8328811">In other words even if we had said categorically that the result would be different, that would still have been dictum, but we didn't even say it categorically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.158" offset="8365800">We just said the result may be different, and there's a substantial basis for making such an argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.812" offset="8384400">Now maybe there is, but it seems to me a pretty bad argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.434" offset="8394953">Why can't the state put you to your choice?</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.286" offset="8406342">If you want to be treated you admit your guilt and maybe you have to take your chance on a perjury prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.453" offset="8438943">On the other hand if you don't want to do that you can't be treated, and since you can't be treated you're going to be a dangerous person and we're going to keep you here for 5 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.089" offset="8477500">Why isn't that perfectly reasonable?</text>

            <label>Mr. Billy B. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="2087.969" offset="8489098">Well, one of the arguments that we raised in our brief is the fact that Mr. Imlay could be charged in the future with perjury if he admitted his guilt in order to participate in a sex offender therapy program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.350" offset="8550538">And I think as a result of the decision in the State of Montana in reference to the Drummond case that I cited in my supplemental brief it shows that an admission by Mr. Imlay would tend to incriminate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.513" offset="8627234">In fact the Drummond case where the defendant was accused and was convicted, at least he pled guilty to sexual intercourse without consent, and he was sentenced to the Montana State Prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.734" offset="8688151">In that particular case one of the conditions placed on him was he was required to participate in a sex offender therapy program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.700" offset="8723991">In participating in the program he admitted certain criminal acts that he had done prior to being incarcerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.289" offset="8766310">He was compelled to admit these acts because of the fact that in a sex offender therapy program you are required to permit prior criminal acts and you are basically in a position whereby you can either be prosecuted for those acts or you will have immunity for those acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.131" offset="9137667">It depends on the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.645" offset="8855753">Now, the State of Montana has made it clear in the Montana Code Annotated that where there's a child involved a professional must notify the Department of Family Services of any information he receives during his professional duties that will show that the child has been neglected or abused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.631" offset="8959720">That information will also be reported to the state, and in turn the state can file charges against a particular individual while participating in the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.489" offset="9007159">And this is what the Drummond case is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.060" offset="9017399">Drummond was participating in a treatment program and it showed that the state was willing to take the statement that he made to his therapist during treatment and notify the Department of Family Services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.409" offset="9062852">And consequently he was found guilty or he pled guilty to incest, and now he's awaiting sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.657" offset="9103812">So basically there is an exception to whether you are granted immunity when you participate in the sex offender therapy program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.832" offset="9140488">And it's clear pursuant to the Montana Code Annotated in reference to that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.216" offset="9158042">So basically that is the reason why Mr. Imlay could have been under the threat of perjury because of the fact that the therapist would have been able to testify in reference to any statements made to him, not only the fact that Mr. Imlay would have to make a statement to the therapist but he would also have had to sign a contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="2389.101" offset="9693552">I can commit you to prison for 5 years or if certain conditions precedent are fulfilled I can place you on probation so that you can undergo therapy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.890" offset="9744752">One of the conditions of undergoing therapy is that you must admit that there is something for which you need the therapy and you must admit your guilt in other words in order to go through the therapy program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.596" offset="9787593">Your client said I'll take the therapy program, Your Honor, and your client then later on, just as he has in this case, refused to admit his guilt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2854.224" offset="11554098">The state argues that it is constitutionally permissible to compel Mr. Imlay to admit his guilt for the purpose of having him accept responsibility for the crime for which he had been convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.876" offset="11632674">Now although this Court has confirmed the position taken by the state regarding the acceptance of responsibility, this Court also made it clear that before a defendant could be compelled to accept responsibility whereby he would have to make an incriminating statement he should be granted immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.481" offset="11711146">However, in this case with Mr. Imlay immunity would not have been appropriate under the circumstances because immunity is not a protection for a charge of perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.399" offset="11766734">Mr. Imlay would have been required to make an inconsistent statement in order to participate in the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.426" offset="11806858">So by changing his statement from the original ones he made at trial he would have committed perjury and therefore any immunity that would be granted to a person participating in the sex offender program would not be applicable in his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.666" offset="11879792">This dilemma that Mr. Imlay was facing at the time he attempted to enroll in the sex offender therapy program is identical to that which the sex offender was facing in Gilfillen v. State of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.405" offset="11930783">Now, in that case the court stated that where a defendant has not pled guilty, but rather he has been found guilty while maintaining his innocence, the court cannot force him to admit his guilt as a condition of probation, nor can the court revoke a probationary sentence because he will not admit his guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.204" offset="12041960">Despite the obvious violation of Mr. Imlay's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, the state court is requesting that this Court should disregard the blatant constitutional violation in the interest of promoting rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.006" offset="12121164">Now, Mr. Imlay concedes that the state has a legitimate rehabilitative interest in requiring that sex offenders participate in a program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.702" offset="12164005">However, since denial is the type of behavior common to individuals convicted of sexual offenses, it seems paradoxical to classify an individual as a sex offender, place that individual on probation, and then revoke his probationary sentence simply because he exhibits the behavior common to sex offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.240" offset="12266091">The parties who submitted amicus brief on behalf of the state express concern that if this Court upholds the Montana State Supreme Court decision in this case it will have an adverse effect on the rehabilitation process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.956" offset="12353027">While their position is understandable, their logic is faulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.208" offset="12374029">Should this Court uphold the decision of the Montana State Supreme Court such a decision would send a clear message to all sex offender programs that society demands treatment for all sex offenders, not just for a few, not just for the ones who will admit their guilt but for all sex offenders.</text>

            <text syncTime="3372.251" offset="13626130">And thirdly, it is not clear at all that there's any evidence derivative of any statements that he made during sex offender treatment that were relied upon for subsequent prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.936" offset="13664896">So it is entirely a different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.619" offset="13675658">And in reference to Justice Stevens' point, which obviously poses some consternation for me as well, if we lose, Justice Stevens, the parole board could not refuse parole based upon a failure to complete phase 2 of the sex offender treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.491" offset="13739188">That's what we want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.502" offset="13743159">We want to be able to make Mr. Imlay go through phase 2, which does require an admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.384" offset="13762698">So in our judgment we would urge upon you that there is a case or controversy.</text>
