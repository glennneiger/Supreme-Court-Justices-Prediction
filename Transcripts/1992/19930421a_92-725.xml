            <text syncTime="62.281" offset="377697">The lesser number involve the issue of whether or not a defendant is competent to proceed to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.598" offset="410924">In this case the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Federal habeas corpus review of a state court conviction and the imposition of three death sentences concluded that there is a heightened standard for the determination of whether a defendant may proceed to either waive counsel or to enter a plea of guilty, which occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.732" offset="499427">We take exception to that ruling, and that is the issue that brings us here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.646" offset="523146">However, there are some underlying findings by the state trial court that I would like to direct the Court's attention to, specifically they appear at page 21 of the Joint Appendix.</text>

            <text syncTime="135.802" offset="671731">He also made an express finding that Mr. Moran knew the consequences of his plea of guilty and that he can intelligently and knowingly waive his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.999" offset="728573">In 1988 the judge made additional findings which also appear in the trial record and are before this Court, particularly at the pages D-7 and D-8 of the petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="442.020" offset="1896665">But in the sequence of events that may well happen a judge may proceed on a Boykin canvas or a Faretta canvas in terms of a defendant waiving counsel and ascertain that a further inquiry into competence is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.071" offset="1964792">The competence evaluation does not necessarily occur first in every instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.903" offset="1984123">Here the totality of the circumstances that faced the trial judge understandably did not peak any further inquiry once he had made his conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.141" offset="2033129">It has to be noted from the record that both trial counsel appointed to represent Mr. Moran in these two separate incidences were present in court up to the time that the judge made his finding that Mr. Moran was competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.213" offset="2097390">And in fact at the conclusion of the competence determination before the judge allowed them to be discharged the record clearly reflects that he asked them if they had anything to say to the court or to address the court and they chose not to and indicated that the judge had covered what was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.714" offset="2175444">At that point in time the judge had fulfilled the requisite requirements under Dusky.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.909" offset="2208149">However, the question before us is did the Ninth Circuit standard require a baseline of constitutional due process for those defendants either waiving counsel or pleading guilty which is higher than the baseline this Court established in Dusky.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.743" offset="2283486">It is our contention that no such standard is required by the pronouncements of this Court, nor should one be applied for there are several problems that ensue because of it, the first and not the least of which is if you require a defendant to be more competent to waive counsel in some instances you do not allow a defendant to exercise the parallel right to represent himself, which this Court clearly set out in Faretta.</text>

            <text syncTime="818.555" offset="3402781">And it is our position that had it not substituted the facts, even under the heightened standard, the defendant in this case could not prevail, and clearly he could not prevail under the standard that we espouse before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.464" offset="3458369">In this instance the trial judge looked at the totality of circumstances to assess the defendant's competence, and only when he concluded that he was competend did he proceed to a very thorough Faretta canvas which appears in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.776" offset="3527646">And then and only then did he allow waiver of counsel, and then he proceeded into a very thorough plea canvas which comports fully with this Court's holdings in Boykin and the subsequent cases that ensued as a result of Boykin.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.470" offset="3606431">Although the defendant contested the knowing and intelligent quality of the pleas that he entered, those legal determinations were made in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.128" offset="3657004">And truly the Federal courts never got to the issue because the Ninth Circuit's holding was grounded in its ruling that as a matter of law that the higher standard applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.067" offset="3716773">It never got to the intelligent and knowing waiver issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.461" offset="3742373">However, in further response to Justice Kennedy's initial inquiry, once competence is ascertained it is our belief that there are protections built into the system, the requirements that those canvases in both Faretta instances and Boykin instances must be knowing and intelligent, and that together the Dusky standard, the Faretta standard, and the Boykin standard provide the minimal due process that each defendant should have in our system before they are held to account for their actions in a criminal court, be it state or Federal.</text>

            <text syncTime="954.865" offset="3948009">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="966.142" offset="3993148">The position of the United States in this case is that a valid finding of competency to stand trial suffices to establish competency to plead guilty or waive counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.020" offset="4040586">This Court formulated a test of competence over 30 years ago in Dusky v. United States, and we believe that it is still a workable standard for determining competency to perform all of the functions that a defendant may be called upon to perform in the course of standing trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.542" offset="4114670">Now there are a number of reasons why this Court should reject the idea that a person can go to trial and yet be unable to waive constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.938" offset="4152286">First, that view seriously distorts the meaning of Dusky and the standard of competence to stand trial in this Court's cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.544" offset="4186768">That standard must be understood in light of other cases of this Court such as Jones v. Barnes that identifies certain decisions that are ultimately for the defendant to make in the course of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.782" offset="4235669">Therefore in order to be competent to stand trial an individual must at least have the potential capacity for basic decision making in response to well explained alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.210" offset="4281331">And there is no difference in principle or practice between the choices that confront defendants routinely at trial and the decisions at issue in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2317.585" offset="9398928">Our argument was essentially that Johnson-Zerbst invokes a protection of the trial court when the accused is without counsel to assure the voluntariness.</text>

            <text syncTime="2330.114" offset="9448978">The protecting duty imposes serious and weighty responsibilities upon the trial judge of determining whether there is an intelligent and competent waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.409" offset="9482206">And we look to Justice Frankfurter and Jackson statements in Von Moltke v. Gillies about a searching inquiry of the court that there must be an understanding choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.656" offset="9527137">Now in Westbrook the Court reiterated the distinction between competency to stand trial with counsel and competency to proceed uncounseled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.913" offset="9572172">It required a separate inquiry because Dusky addresses a different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.157" offset="9589204">Although it may be the same standard, the context specific is what is important, whether in fact you can assist counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.742" offset="9623476">Our argument is that the plea to be voluntary must be understood.</text>

            <text syncTime="2395.096" offset="9708949">So the mere fact that the trial court had the individual before them was not enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="2653.695" offset="10743293">Our argument was that the Nevada Supreme Court had adopted Melacor, the Pate type situation, which required them to go through a hearing, that Pate required them under a context-specific situation to make an additional determination of competency, his competency at that time to waive counsel and enter a plea.</text>

            <text syncTime="2676.870" offset="10835976">Mr. Potter, a minute ago if I understood you I thought you answered a question of mine in this way, that what was defective in this case was the failure of the court to make the kind of knowingness and voluntariness inquiry upon the waiver or attempted waiver of counsel that would have been required if the defendant had pleaded guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.936" offset="10936286">Now I understand you to be saying something different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.859" offset="10951960">I understand you now to be saying that the failure here was in fact a failure under existing law, the existing law being that there is a continuing duty on the part of the court to make an inquiry into competence whenever facts come to the court's attention that might put that competence in question, and that the facts in this case were facts brought to the court's knowledge about the drug use, the medication that the defendant was on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.719" offset="11075466">And so that your claim of error here is that the court did not fulfill its affirmative duty under existing case law to make a thorough inquiry to find out whether the medication had in fact rendered the individual incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.812" offset="11151744">Is that your position?</text>

            <text syncTime="2758.634" offset="11163029">We had made a double argument that in fact in terms of the medication that he was incompetent as to actual competency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.450" offset="11198346">We also made an argument that the court was required, upon already knowing that there was a question as to his competency to stand trial and assist counsel because of the fact that he had committed suicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.667" offset="11243173">So they did a preliminary psychiatric examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.591" offset="11258951">But in addition to that when they were made aware of the medication we were also entitled to an additional competency hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.764" offset="11291551">What really occurred here was no competency hearing at the time that these pleas were entered and the waiver of counsel was made.</text>

            <text syncTime="2798.308" offset="11321749">Whether or not that's so, it sounds to me as though what you're arguing now is basically that there was an error under existing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.695" offset="11351320">The Ninth Circuit may have gone off on a tangent which you do not defend, but your position is simply that there was an error under existing law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2816.171" offset="11393220">And the existing law, Sieling v. Eyman, that case encompasses the same thing that Melacor v. the Nevada Supreme Court, which incorporates the Pate type hearing, is the same analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2861.021" offset="11572629">But the incidence in this situation is that they did, the state courts did apply the wrong standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.695" offset="11599274">We were essentially dealing with an argument about competency to waive counsel, Westbrook, and they were dealing with Faretta.</text>

            <text syncTime="2951.759" offset="11935626">I suppose it would border somewhat on speculation on my part, but it would seem that's one reading of their decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.196" offset="11969377">In this case if the higher standard does not apply, deference must be afforded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.068" offset="11992782">Mr. Potter's argument was that no hearing was held, and that's what they really proffered to the Ninth Circuit as a basis for relief, fails to recognize that a hearing was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.419" offset="12046177">And although this Court has said that it is not the preferred method of assessing competence to have a hearing after the fact, the fact of the matter is that the same trial judge conducted a hearing and applied the burden of proof to the same party who had the burden under Nevada state law, Doggett v. State, a 1977 case, to show that he was incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.805" offset="12151711">Of course this Court just said last term that it is not impermissible to require a defendant to bear that burden of proof, in Medina.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.622" offset="12191000">He didn't bear that burden of proof, and in fact the judge was singularly unpersuaded by his proffer of evidence and his failure to show how the medication impacted the defendant at the time of the entry of plea and waiver of counsel situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.985" offset="12272502">The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.858" offset="12287966">He had his hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.278" offset="12293609">And this Court's recent pronouncement in Keeney v. Thomiel Reyes would seem to say the fact that he didn't present the evidence then requires him to make a showing of cause and prejudice, and he hasn't even argued that, much less shown it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.768" offset="12359646">He should not be given the second opportunity in the Federal courts to do what he had the opportunity to do, but did not, in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.423" offset="12394232">If the Court has no further questions, I have no further argument.</text>
