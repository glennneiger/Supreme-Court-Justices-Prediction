            <label>Mr. Gary M. Elden</label>
            <text syncTime="11.184" offset="192396">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.089" offset="203994">This case involves RICO and, in particular, it involves what does it mean to participate in the conduct of the affairs of an enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.680" offset="234296">The case is here on writ of certiorari from the Eighth Circuit which affirmed the summary judgment for an accounting firm on the ground that they did not participate in the conduct of the affairs of the Farmer's Co-op.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.926" offset="283302">The only relevant fact the Court needs to know I think about the Farmer's Co-op is that it financed itself by selling demand notes to its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.844" offset="314962">They... the Eighth Circuit held that the proper test was whether the accounting firm engaged in the operation or management of the co-op, but to understand the test I think it's necessary to keep three facts in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.509" offset="377656">There's an enormous number of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.306" offset="384866">I'm just going to stress three.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.447" offset="389359">I think without it, it's not possible to fully appreciate how restricted the test is.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.241" offset="408585">All courts agree... and I'm going to use the language of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.178" offset="424363">So, this is not my version of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.771" offset="430737">The courts who gave the summary judgment agreed that these facts a jury could have found: first, that Arthur Young "created" the financial statements of the co-op, not audited them... not audited them, but created them.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.204" offset="484445">And the district court explained in detail what he meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.265" offset="496670">Arthur Young invented the cost figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.436" offset="509418">Arthur Young, according to the district court, engaged in a blatant fiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.511" offset="525718">The records of the co-op showed that a sale had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.791" offset="542750">A multi-million dollar transaction had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.228" offset="552572">A self-dealing transaction that rendered the co-op insolvent was a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.648" offset="570231">All the records showed that: tax returns, minutes, court decrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.193" offset="584441">They chose themselves, consulting no one, to ignore that fact, and numerous other points that the district court made.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.753" offset="614639">They created the financial statements, and they created financial statements, basically on their own without consulting very much anyone else, which concealed the insolvency of the co-op and concealed the self-dealing and even crimes of the principals.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.199" offset="668451">Second, the courts agreed that Arthur Young took the financial statements it had created and used those affirmatively to mislead the investors and the buyers of the demand notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.492" offset="721636">They did this by participating... that's the court's word... participating in the creation of condensed financial statements, which everybody admits were fraudulent and misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.051" offset="759775">Even Arthur Young makes no attempt to defend those.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.190" offset="768343">And they attended annual meetings where both courts, Eighth Circuit and the district court, agreed they lied in response to direct questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.937" offset="807318">They deliberately concealed facts from the investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.296" offset="816827">The jury found... there was not even appeal on the weight of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.340" offset="833023">So, it has become final... that they did this with the actual intent to mislead and deceive investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.088" offset="851935">And the Eighth Circuit said that everybody knew that if the investors were not told of the insolvency, they'd continue to buy demand notes, and if they were told, there would have been a run on the co-op.</text>

            <text syncTime="199.626" offset="946081">There were nine directors, five of whom remained in office and who were at least guilty of negligence if not collusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.108" offset="972098">There were four reform directors who were trying to get to the bottom of things and tell the truth to people.</text>

            <text syncTime="210.606" offset="990071">You see, I'd find it easier to say that they participated In the conduct of the company's business if they were acting jointly with one of the managers or directors, or at least an employee of the company who was conducting the company's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.004" offset="1067602">Then I could say they participated in the conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.987" offset="1075543">But as you describe it, anybody that they would have made common cause with was gone, and they were just acting on their own.</text>

            <text syncTime="240.250" offset="1108667">I would like to make it as easy as possible for Your Honor to agree with me, but the truth is that they basically did it... they did 95 percent of this themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.169" offset="1144298">No one... there's no proof anyone even knew what they were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.105" offset="1156001">They pulled off the fraud to cover up themselves, to protect their friends who were by then gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.821" offset="1174913">Now, Kirit Goradia did pull together some of the financial data.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.022" offset="1191736">I mean, there was a lot of financial data in the financial statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.568" offset="1201872">It wasn't all cooked.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.678" offset="1206365">Some of it was straight.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.459" offset="1209499">Kirit Goradia pulled that together.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.613" offset="1218067">But I think essentially the creation of the false financial statements was virtually totally the work of Arthur Young.</text>

            <text syncTime="298.945" offset="1343351">Your Honor, our view that we presented to the jury was that the motive was to cover up what amounted to crimes not only by Jack White who was on his way to jail or in jail by then, but the lawyers for Jack White who had suborned perjury who had put this whole crooked deal together and could themselves been disbarred or who knows what.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.439" offset="1409388">Those were the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.172" offset="1416285">The people who needed the coverup were the people who changed orders to Arthur Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.030" offset="1431749">Nothing wrong with the old auditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.545" offset="1437810">He had done it the right... he had recorded it as not being owned by the co-op the previous year.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.574" offset="1457872">The people who needed the coverup brought in Arthur Young and they got it.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.433" offset="1469365">In terms of participation, if I could address Justice Scalia's point, because I would like to make it easy for everyone to agree with me, I think that there's a lot of things Arthur Young did not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.678" offset="1514296">They didn't sell the grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.709" offset="1518476">They didn't do the lease.</text>

            <text syncTime="1024.480" offset="4245555">Now, the issue before the Court today is whether the Eighth Circuit was correct in holding that the RICO statute requires that a defendant operate or manage the business in order to be held liable under section 1961(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.723" offset="4306472">That holding, we submit, is wrong for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.830" offset="4326952">First, it departs from the text of the statute which does not use the words "operate" or "manage" to describe the requirements for liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.608" offset="4366032">Second... and I think this goes to Justice O'Connor's question about the application of the rule of lenity in this case... the Eighth Circuit's holding ignores that Congress used the words RICO and in other contemporaneous laws, and I will detail those laws in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.442" offset="4461431">When Congress wished to impose the requirements of operation or management for liability, it did so explicitly, not as the Eighth Circuit did through the back door by a gloss on words that do not contain that sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1435.471" offset="5889493">Of course, we're not talking here about examples that are actually covered by the RICO statute unless you have the requisite pattern of predicate crimes, and in this case, of course, we do have a pattern of predicate mail fraud and securities fraud crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.825" offset="5946962">The Eighth Circuit's test is wrong most fundamentally because RICO itself uses the terms that the Eighth Circuit read into section 1962(c) in other places.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.915" offset="5991266">Section 1962(a) prohibits operation of the enterprise with racketeering proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.677" offset="6018329">Section 1962(b) prohibits acquiring control over the enterprise through racketeering acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.034" offset="6043720">The D.C. Circuit said that section 1962(c) requires control, but it's quite clear that Congress imposed that requirement on a different section of RICO, not on this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.373" offset="6089068">The gambling statute, 18 U.S.C., section 1955(a), applies to whoever conducts, finances, manages, supervises, directs, or owns an illegal gambling business, and that statute was passed as another title of the same act of which RICO was a title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.929" offset="6167331">Using standard principles of statutory construction, it would be very difficult to say that Congress intended the same limitation in RICO that it explicitly passed in another title of the same act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.689" offset="6214352">And 2 weeks after passing RICO, Congress enacted the continuing criminal enterprise statute which applies to a position... a person in the position of organizer, a supervisory position, or any other position of management in a group engaging in narcotics activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.323" offset="6276941">And against the background of those statutes, section 1962(c) must be read as Congress wrote it, to cover generally persons who participate through usurping the enterprise's activities, corrupting the enterprise's activities, or using the enterprise's activities to enhance their ability to commit criminal acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1631.660" offset="6674211">The Court's task in this case is just... is, obviously, to decide what Congress meant when it included the conduct requirement in section 1962(c), and the Court needs to approach that task by choosing, from among all the possible meanings that are set forth in the briefs and the arguments, the one that most fits with a common sense, logical understanding of what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.994" offset="6763550">Our position is that the Eighth Circuit's operation or management test meets that requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.289" offset="6784761">At least we seem to agree with the Government, that the place to start here is with the language of the statute itself, but in fact, the Government's approach and the petitioners' approach I think, as Justice Stevens points out, has the tendency to completely read out of the statute the conduct requirement altogether because it's very difficult for them to articulate a distinction between participate in the affairs, which is not what the statute says, and participate in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs, which is what the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.901" offset="6907223">Conduct is there for a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.681" offset="6914329">This Court has already said in Sedima that conduct is one of the elements that a RICO plaintiff has to prove.</text>

            <text syncTime="3125.602" offset="12649983">The Government is also concerned about the low level defendants, although Mr. Dreeben acknowledges that the Justice Department doesn't bring RICO prosecutions at some de minimis level, but they have nevertheless expressed concern about the small fry as the case is referred to in criminal enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.377" offset="12721140">But there's no reason that those defendants as well would not be covered by the Eighth Circuit's operation or management test because even if they are not themselves operating or managing or conducting because they're not at the top of the hierarchy or anywhere near the top of the hierarchy, they are operating under the direction of the people who do run the enterprise, and they therefore participate indirectly in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.570" offset="12821868">And as I said, the Government really has not given us any examples of RICO prosecutions that they bring or that they even want to bring that would not be covered by the Eighth Circuit's operation or management test.</text>

            <text syncTime="3199.869" offset="12947047">This case is very similar to what the Court did last term in Thompson Center Arms, construing a civil tax case that had criminal implications, couldn't find a way to resolve the ambiguity from either the legislative history or the statutory language, and it used the rule of lenity as a tie-breaker.</text>

            <text syncTime="3219.081" offset="13023952">If the Court is unable to conclude from the language, purpose, legislative history of RICO, then the rule of lenity ought to still lead to the same result as the Eighth Circuit applied here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3539.716" offset="14306459">Should we limit RICO's scope to people who can act authoritatively on behalf of the company?</text>
