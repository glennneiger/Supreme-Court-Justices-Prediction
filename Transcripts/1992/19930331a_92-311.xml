            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="138348">We'll hear argument next in No. 92-311, Donna E. Shalala v. Richard H. Schaefer.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.677" offset="177009">Mr. Kelley.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_k_kelley" startTime="46.011" stopTime="211.419">
            <label>Mr. William K. Kelley</label>
            <text syncTime="46.011" offset="322355">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="50.135" offset="338864">The question in this case is whether respondent's application for attorney's fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act was filed on time.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.881" offset="373868">The case involves the interplay between two statutes, section 2412(d) of EAJA, and 42 United States Code, section 405(g), which is the provision in the Social Security Act that gives unsuccessful applicants for benefits a right to bring a cause of action challenging that decision in district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.614" offset="456728">Respondent in this case applied for benefits, and his claim was denied at all levels of the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.936" offset="482015">He then filed a civil action pursuant to section 405(g) in district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.261" offset="499360">The district court concluded that the agency had made a mistake and reversed the decision denying respondent benefits and remanded the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.228" offset="539171">It is undisputed here that the court acted pursuant to sentence four of section 405(g).</text>
            <text syncTime="105.731" offset="561218">That sentence gives district courts the authority to enter a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the decision of the Secretary with or without remanding the case as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.267" offset="603328">Respondent did not at that time file his EAJA fee application, but instead waited until after he was awarded benefits on remand and filed an application at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.374" offset="647840">We contend that that application was untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.616" offset="660797">Under the language of subsection (d)(1)(B) of EAJA, a fee application must be filed within 30 days of final judgment in the underlying civil action for which fees are being sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.623" offset="708758">Subsection (d)(2)(G) of EAJA, in turn, defines the term final judgment to mean a judgment that is final and not appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.289" offset="743448">Sentence eight of section 405(g) says that the judgment entered pursuant to sentence four is a final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.647" offset="784931">It follows under the language of these statutes that respondent's fee application was due at the time that the sentence for judgment was entered and this case was remanded to the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.615" offset="824741">Now, this Court's recent decisions in Sullivan against Finkelstein and Melkonyan against Sullivan confirm our reading of the statute as correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.480" offset="856193">In Finkelstein, the Court held that sentence four remands constitute a final judgment and that such judgments are appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.164" offset="890988">In that decision, the Court said that any action a court takes under sentence four must include a judgment, whether or not a remand is included as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.761" offset="929336">That conclusion followed from the language of sentence four which the Court in Finkelstein said, quote, directs the entry of a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.615" offset="956712">The statute does not say that a district court can do anything under sentence four without also entering a judgment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="211.419" stopTime="222.230">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="211.419" offset="983984">Well, what if a court makes a mistake?</text>
            <text syncTime="213.441" offset="992030">Isn't that possible?</text>
            <text syncTime="215.695" offset="1001120">I mean to say that the court should have entered a judgment is not necessarily to say that the court did enter a judgment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_k_kelley" startTime="222.230" stopTime="235.370">
            <label>Mr. William K. Kelley</label>
            <text syncTime="222.230" offset="1027243">In Finkelstein, Justice Scalia, that very argument was made, and the Court rejected that point saying that regardless of the label the district court attaches to its order, it is a judgment and it is final and effective as such.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="235.370" stopTime="238.461">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="235.370" offset="1079801">It shall be deemed a judgment whether the court says so or not.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_k_kelley" startTime="238.461" stopTime="290.275">
            <label>Mr. William K. Kelley</label>
            <text syncTime="238.461" offset="1092131">Yes, otherwise a court would simply be free to act contrary to what the statute permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.715" offset="1113133">Now, sentence six of section 405(g) stands in contrast to sentence four, for in that sentence Congress gave district courts the authority to remand cases without entering judgment and also to require the Secretary to return to district court after the remand for further proceedings in district court, at which point a judgment would then be entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.318" offset="1195576">The unanimous opinion a year later in Melkonyan confirmed... further confirms our reading here.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.073" offset="1226609">In Melkonyan, the Court said explicitly that section 405(g) only authorizes district courts to act pursuant to the procedures of sentence four or sentence six.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.192" offset="1275092">There is no room in that statute for a hybrid procedure, such as the one respondent urges here.</text>

          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="290.275" stopTime="310.819">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="290.275" offset="1299439">Well, now, Mr. Kelley, I think that in the Hudson case, which was the first, that the Government conceded there was no final judgment for Equal Access to Justice Act purposes until the administrative proceeding on remand was concluded.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_k_kelley" startTime="310.819" stopTime="319.116">
            <label>Mr. William K. Kelley</label>
            <text syncTime="310.819" offset="1381568">That is correct, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.231" offset="1387210">We did concede that in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.743" offset="1393270">This Court's decisions in Finkelstein and Melkonyan following Hudson have--</text>

            <text syncTime="319.116" offset="1414795">Well, Melkonyan certainly said it wasn't overturning Hudson.</text>

            <text syncTime="324.069" offset="1434544">--That is certainly true as well, but Melkonyan referred to Hudson as encompassing a narrow class of cases.</text>

            <label>Mr. William K. Kelley</label>
            <text syncTime="331.245" offset="1463279">And our submission is that Hudson applies only in sentence six cases because under the terms of sentence four, as the Court interpreted that sentence in Finkelstein and Melkonyan subsequent to Hudson, the Court has concluded that there is no such jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="357.592" offset="1568709">I mean, it's... there has to be some way to work this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.505" offset="1584278">Congress intended under EAJA that these claimants, if the Government's position was substantially unjustified, are going to recover their costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.084" offset="1634642">And just how is it you think this is going to work?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. William K. Kelley</label>
            <text syncTime="378.084" offset="1650629">We quite agree that Congress intended applicants who succeed in litigation against the Government and obtain benefits in which in our case... our position was not substantially justified to get benefits.</text>

            <label>Mr. William K. Kelley</label>
            <text syncTime="394.336" offset="1715621">That is quite true, and that problem is easily solved, we would submit, simply by filing an application at the time Congress has required under the terms of the two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.111" offset="1746759">That application can be held in abeyance until after it is clear whether the person is a prevailing party and resolved at that time.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="408.976" offset="1774240">It can also be held in abeyance for the duration of life on this planet so far as the statute is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.540" offset="1800467">Isn't the problem there that if you do that, you have no time limit disciplining the point at which the claimant has got to come in for the fees?</text>

            <text syncTime="423.878" offset="1833799">I don't believe that is a problem, Justice Souter, for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.260" offset="1847383">The claimant, after proceedings on remand have been finished, has every incentive to rush back to district court for his fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.774" offset="1869430">And I would also point out that under respondent's view there is similarly a problem of no time limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.340" offset="1891687">Under respondent's submission, the burden is on either the Secretary or the claimant to go back to district court at some unspecified time, without time limit, after the remand proceedings are completed and obtain a judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="451.117" offset="1942782">Well, that may be, but there's a third possibility in which the claimant who cannot at the point of remand certify that he is entitled as a winner, that the claimant, in effect, is going to take the benefit of the tolling of the statute until the prevailing... his prevailing party status is clear, and then the 30 days runs.</text>

            <text syncTime="473.212" offset="2031181">Well, that's precisely... in effect, I should say, precisely the submission the Court rejected in Melkonyan, which is that matters should stand in abeyance until the proceedings on remand are finished and the decision of the administrative agency will demonstrate whether the party is a prevailing party, and the time period should then start then.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.404" offset="2107876">That... the Court rejected that position of the Government in that case unanimously.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.247" offset="2123236">And it seems to me that that position would have workability problems as well because it would be... it will be an inchoate time which... at which the fee application would be due.</text>

            <text syncTime="1658.082" offset="6770629">Today the Court is presented with the question whether the Equal Access to Justice statute permits a Social Security disability claimant, whose case is remanded from the Federal court to the Secretary for further administrative proceedings, under the fourth sentence of section 405(g) to file his application for EAJA fees upon successful completion of the administrative remand proceedings, or whether as urged by the Government, every such claimant must immediately after receipt of a sentence four remand file a conditional EAJA application at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.667" offset="6924960">We contend that the decision below of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals granting my client, Mr. Schaefer, an EAJA award in the amount of $1,372.50 should be affirmed, and today I would like to focus upon the three main reasons why it should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.092" offset="7002701">The first is that the lower court decision, in accordance with nationwide practice since at least 1989, is consistent with the plain terms and the intent of the EAJA statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.590" offset="7052647">Secondly, considering the matter from a common sense standpoint, our approach is much more practical and reasonable than the unworkable solution posited by the Government today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.986" offset="7102279">Finally, the procedure that we followed in asking for EAJA fees in this case was directly consistent with and, indeed, may be mandated by this Court's decision in Hudson.</text>

            <text syncTime="2766.489" offset="11204235">I believe the Court has a good understanding of what the Government's approach entails.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.282" offset="11219386">Let me highlight some of the practical problems with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.445" offset="11232030">The first is that their scheme is the ultimate in setting traps for the unwary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.348" offset="11255644">They have indicated that a conditional filing must be made shortly after the sentence four remand is issued by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.395" offset="11291902">They don't indicate what documents they would deem necessary at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.960" offset="11318129">They don't indicate what would have to be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.482" offset="11332235">It is very possible that district courts for failure to fulfill all of the requirements of the EAJA statute, particularly the showing of prevailing party status, the showing of the specific amount of fees requested and so forth, could dismiss those type of premature petitions as being inappropriate under the plain language of the EAJA statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.067" offset="11422515">I think what the Government's approach invites is a potential of a multiplicity of litigation and further appeals and so forth dealing with what the proper filings would be under a conditional type filing theory, as the Government urges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.857" offset="11485731">In addition, the amount, which Justice O'Connor asked about, of needless filings that would be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.554" offset="11516555">If you look at our brief, we cite the 1990 statistics in which there were over 4,300 remands nationwide from district courts to the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.810" offset="11561486">38 percent of those claimants lost on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.513" offset="11576324">So, when you analyze those figures, at least 1,600 of those petitions that would have had to have been filed were superfluous or unnecessary and were clogging up the district court dockets.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2873.071" stopTime="2879.506">

            <text syncTime="2873.071" offset="11630554">Do you agree with the... with Mr. Kelley's figures on the numbers of cases involved?</text>

            <text syncTime="2879.506" offset="11656363">Mr. Kelley is citing some figures that are a little bit more recent than the 1990 figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.180" offset="11675066">In 1991, the total number of remands nationwide went down to 2,526, and the percentage of claimants which lost on remand went down a little bit to about a third at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.740" offset="11729297">I think that he attempts to minimize the nationwide impact by breaking it down to 21 or whatever per judicial district when, in fact, you have to look at the nationwide effect because they're not necessarily spread out on an average basis among judicial districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.191" offset="11799096">The Secretary is concerned about delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.754" offset="11813306">Let's talk about delay because they contend that, under the present system and the approach urged by our side, the respondent in this case, there is this great potential for delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.083" offset="11862626">First of all, there's no evidence that claimants or their counsel have been dilatory or routinely delayed these type of filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.389" offset="11895853">In fact, even as the Secretary concedes today, there is a tremendous incentive on the part of claimants and their counsel to get these in and to get the fees paid as quickly as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.486" offset="11940261">Under the Government's theory, you'd have to first file this conditional application for fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.380" offset="11963772">You would then have to go back and go through the remand proceedings before the Secretary, but then significantly, the Government's theory contains no mechanism for triggering any further time limits upon the claimant or their counsel to come back to court and file for those fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.344" offset="12039631">Under their theory, assuming that there was the incentive to delay, which we deny, the claimant and their counsel could wait forever before coming back and having the district court finally act upon those fee petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.883" offset="12093861">Under our system, it's very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.956" offset="12106087">Once the administrative process is complete, the Secretary herself, if she's concerned about delay, can come in and simply file a motion for entry of final judgment, which will automatically trigger that EAJA time limit to start running.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.599" offset="12164706">Therefore, the Secretary under our theory has within her own power the power to limit the untimely applications that she fears would be coming.</text>

            <text syncTime="3062.992" offset="12390299">But the average length of time is 13.9 months from the time the court orders the remand until you know whether you won or lost in the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.080" offset="12430632">And in my experience, it varies greatly from a year and a half, possibly as short as 6 months in some cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.055" offset="12458531">It just depends upon the individual calendars and dockets of the administrative hearing judges that hear these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3312.198" offset="13387132">I have two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.988" offset="13394237">First, we believe that our approach, as set forth in the brief, accommodates the language of all the relevant statutes in this Court's cases, quite unlike respondent's approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.426" offset="13436033">But if the Court disagrees with that, we believe it would be preferable to adopt the approach suggested by Justice Scalia that one is a prevailing party when one gets a sentence four remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.842" offset="13477620">But we would also urge at that point that there is simply no basis for an award of so-called Hudson fees for the proceedings on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.799" offset="13509489">The second point is as to the application of the rules in this case, respondent's argument regarding rule 58 and retroactivity was not raised or passed upon below, and we would urge the Court to remand the case for the court of appeals to consider those issues in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.748" offset="13573332">Thank you.</text>
