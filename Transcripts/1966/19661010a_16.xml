            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 16, William L. Austin, petitioner versus Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.668" offset="194017">Mr. Fleishman.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stanley Fleishman</label>
            <text syncTime="23.932" offset="199137">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.618" offset="217840">Almost three years to the date, a private citizen, a Mrs. Catherine Wolfen, walked into the Read More Bookstore in Paducah, Kentucky and ordered three books, two magazines rather.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.301" offset="296626">She ordered four and she purchased two magazines the required title.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.610" offset="313762">She then marched over to the McCracken County Court House and swore out a complaint in statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.601" offset="361827">He said that Mr. Austin, the owner of the store, had violated the Kentucky Obscenity Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.410" offset="401011">The basis of her charge was that purchase by her and her reading of the magazines in her conclusion based on no judicial standards that the magazines were in fact obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.102" offset="475826">The statute involved provides that any person who sells an obscene book or magazine, knowing the contents or character is guilty of an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.079" offset="547715">The statute also provides that any person who sells a publication found by the jury to be obscene is presumed to know the obscene character of the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.317" offset="620648">Now the evidence against Mr. Austin is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.254" offset="648338">Mr. Austin stipulated that he was the owner and operator of the bookstore.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.227" offset="676237">Mrs. Wolfen testified that she had called up a friend of hers and said, “I'm going to make a buy at Read More come on down and be witness.”</text>
            <text syncTime="152.333" offset="712704">And she made a buy. She stated that the magazines were in a rack behind the cash register and she's testified that they were in this rack behind the cash register because a ministerial association had asked Mr. Austin to take them out of reach of minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.762" offset="810402">And so, Mr. Austin to accommodate himself to this request took them and put them behind the cash register, where only a person who ordered the magazines by title could get them and where no minors could get.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.724" offset="878320">The only other evidence in the case is the testimony of Reverend Simpson, a member of the Citizens for Decent Literature and the head of the Moral and Social Welfare Committee of the Paducah Ministerial Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.533" offset="949478">He testified that he had asked Mr. Austin to come down to a meeting that the ministers had to discuss objectionable material.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.292" offset="1012590">At that time Mr. Austin told the ministers, that if they had any specific publications they thought were obscene to tell him and he would remove them.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.381" offset="1068910">And the ministers in effect said, “Get rid of all of them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="244.135" offset="1079881">That's the sum in substance of what they say.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="252.613" stopTime="315.921">
            <label>Mr. Stanley Fleishman</label>
            <text syncTime="252.613" offset="1113840">No magazines are contained any nudes at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.788" offset="1126484">That was the short of it and that's what the state recognized in their argument, if Your Honor please.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.516" offset="1157413">In their final argument to the jury, they pointed out that in effect the ministers told them to get rid of Playboy now and forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.443" offset="1201194">Not just Playboy May but Playboy so that there won't be any doubt about it and the language is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.649" offset="1229928">This is the argument of the prosecutor to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.337" offset="1252707">They're talking about Mrs.Wolfen as the censor.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.383" offset="1260857">I'm talking on page 86 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.102" offset="1279770">In the first place, I don't hold Mrs. Catherine Wolfen out as the censor of McCracken County. She is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.360" offset="1304848">Neither of the ministers the censors of the McCracken County and they have got no obligation to any person to go out and censor the material as on the stands in Paducah.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.349" offset="1340792">They recognized that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.650" offset="1346017">That's a dangerous situation but what did they do?</text>
            <text syncTime="313.530" offset="1357511">They had a meeting, two meetings, as I recall the testimony.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="315.921" offset="1367019">With the prosecutor?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stanley Fleishman</label>
            <text syncTime="316.922" offset="1371094">With the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.852" offset="1374751">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.024" offset="1379453">The last one in May of 1963, and the objection on the part of the ministers was all of the material that he called adult reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.716" offset="1414248">They objected to it, all of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.072" offset="1423653">There weren't going to specify this issue, that issue or some other issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.878" offset="1442879">They told him that they objected to all of it if they should, why if they have told him they object to the May issue of Playboy magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.252" offset="1468374">All they would have to do is put on the June.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.013" offset="1479450">That's what we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.316" offset="1488645">This is the evidence and all of the evidence upon which petitioner was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.779" offset="1530441">Now at the trial, the petitioner sought to show that he had a good faith belief that the magazines were not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.228" offset="1580283">He tried to show it in a variety of ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.330" offset="1592717">First, he tried to show that he tried to limit himself only to those magazines which had second class mailing privileges from the Post Office Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.031" offset="1643499">A magazine that has second class mailing privileges is presumed to be not obscene because the Post Office Department has no right to issue second class mailing privileges to obscene publications.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.404" offset="1693027">He tried to show that he couldn't possibly read the 11 or 12,000 magazines that were in his store at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.330" offset="1728658">He tried to show that for years he had been distributing exactly the same type of magazine over a four-state area, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri and Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.433" offset="1785083">He tried to show that this Court had found nudist magazines far more revealing than the two magazines involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.357" offset="1816848">But this Court have them to be not obscene and he tried to show that in the Paducah Library, there were books containing portrayals of nudes which were in every respect as frank and as candid as those in the magazines involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.811" offset="1890617">All of these were totally excluded by the trial court and consistent with the rulings or with these rulings of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.242" offset="1924368">The judge refused to give an instruction requested by the petitioner that if the jury found that he had a good faith belief that the magazines were not obscene, the jury should acquit.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.833" offset="1990719">It's indicated the jury found the defendant guilty and the Court of Appeals refused to grant a motion to appeal with the Chief Justice dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.273" offset="2052472">So the first question we have here is the one left open in Smith against California is a good faith belief on the part of the petitioner that the books he handles himself are not obscene, a defense to a obscenity prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.626" offset="2173889">Now, we touch -- it was touch upon in the last page but it does repetition, that there are two important considerations involved in the Smith rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.054" offset="2223626">The first one is that obscenity is defined by this Court is extraordinarily vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.185" offset="2264064">And if a bookseller faced with a very vague law can be held criminally liable when he believes that the publication is in all respect lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.874" offset="2326862">He either goes out of the business or he goes into a business where the risk is higher than in any other lawful business.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.160" offset="2372002">And we're talking about bookstores where ordinarily we want to give maximum and not minimum protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.904" offset="2419022">The other alternative to going out of the business is to handle only cook books and even those aren't so safe because there are so aphrodisiac books on eating.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.759" offset="2490389">Now, the respondent here advances three reasons for denying to the petitioner the right to defend on the ground that he had a good faith belief that the magazines in questions were not obscene and in justifying the trial court's refusal to grant the requested instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.667" offset="2622046">First of all, the respondent says that the evidence against petitioner is so conclusive, so overwhelming that nobody knowing the facts that petitioner knew could have -- could have a good faith belief that they were not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.788" offset="2722565">Now what is this overwhelming evidence?</text>
            <text syncTime="658.005" offset="2735417">The overwhelming evidence is that the petitioner may have no one that he had in his store magazines which contain portrayals of nudes, that's all and this in the face of untold holdings by this Court and other courts that nudity is not synonymous with obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.601" offset="2881808">The second reason given by the respondent is that petitioner couldn't ask and expect to get the instruction on good faith belief because he said, he never read the books, the magazines in the first instance and so, the respondent argues.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.931" offset="2971146">How can he have a good faith belief that the magazines are not obscene without looking at them?</text>
            <text syncTime="724.903" offset="3003016">Respondent argues that before a petitioner, before a bookseller may claim the right to a good -- to the defense of good faith belief that the material is not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.813" offset="3046588">He will have to take the stand and in effect incriminate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.369" offset="3064874">That is to say the prosecutor wants him to get him on the stand and say, “I read the book so magazines.”</text>
            <text syncTime="747.539" offset="3093504">And then from that they'll say uh-huh, he read the books and magazines and that's proof enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.481" offset="3149302">And then the prosecutor respondent finally says that the instruction shouldn't have been given because of Rosen against United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.425" offset="3197053">And that Rosen against United States indeed means that the good faith belief on the part of the bookseller that the material he sells is not obscene is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.557" offset="3261628">With all due respect, we suggest that the Rosen case should not be controlling here.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.731" offset="3302275">First of all, Rosen was decided, it's almost 70 years now, at that time when there were no First Amendment considerations involved or implicated.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stanley Fleishman</label>
            <text syncTime="819.887" offset="3382941">Well, none were raised and none were discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.987" offset="3391300">The entire case was treated as if the First Amendment had no application.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.619" offset="3417840">I think it might have been argued and discussed in a different fashion but as it was handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.843" offset="3438738">It was no First Amendment considerations were brought to play nor considered in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.569" offset="3469667">Secondly, Rosen of course was decided the time when Hicklin controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.331" offset="3500701">Now, a determination of obscenity under Hicklin is quite different from a determination of obscenity under Roth, Alberts as expanded by the various cases of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.426" offset="3549080">Under Hicklin everything was intuitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.643" offset="3561932">There were no outside considerations if person look at something that he didn't like it or he thought it might offend the most susceptible person that was it.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.765" offset="3618461">And the fact is that at the present time it is simply irrational to assume or as previously been discussed that a person who reads the book or reads the magazine knows merely from the reading that the publication offends the obscenity law.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.451" offset="3709158">That is to say that from reading it one would know that it goes beyond customary limits of candor, appeals to prurient interest, and is utterly without redeeming social importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.684" offset="3754088">Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out earlier, if members of this Court have good faith and honest disagreement among their selves with regard to whether a particular book is or is not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.515" offset="3813439">Surely that in itself proves that there is room at least for honest difference of opinion with regard to persons who look at the material and reach contrary completions.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.221" offset="3904240">As indicated, the Kentucky revised statutes provides in 43600 subdivision 4 that the sale of a publication found by a jury to be obscene is presumed to that the seller is presumed to know that it was obscene.</text>

            <text syncTime="1006.161" offset="4128057">Now in the face of this presumption, the petitioner sought to adduce evidence to negate it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1020.720" offset="4186258">It is, Justice Harlan, indicated in the Smith case, a defendant has the right to put on evidence showing that a work doesn't go beyond customary limits of candor on the issue of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.131" offset="4247907">Then he has a light right, we respectfully submit to put on evidence to show that the hidden belief the material is obscene which is what he sought to do in all of which was totally excluded so that on that constitutional issue of scienter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1061.149" offset="4348008">I should point out as we have in our reply brief that after the case here and effective June of this year, Kentucky repealed the statute and amended and enacted a new law and specifically found or in these new statutes, specifically sets the standard as knowledge of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.911" offset="4451035">That is to say under the law in Kentucky as it is exists today, a person who sells a publication found to be obscene must -- the prosecution must prove beyond the reasonable doubt that he had knowledge that the work was obscene and the statute as it now exists has eliminated the presumption which was working against the petitioner in the case at the time that he went to trial and at the time that he was convicted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1141.944" offset="4671195">There was some evidence however which would have been directed solely at his good faith belief that it was not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.946" offset="4699199">That was the evidence where he sought to show that he could not possibly have examined the 11,000 or 12,000 publications that he had in his bookstore at all time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1328.395" offset="5416939">He made his judgment that these magazines were not obscene in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.998" offset="5439404">He tried as a businessman to accommodate himself to the pressures that were put.</text>

            <text syncTime="1661.158" offset="6748035">The Kentucky statute prohibiting the sale of obscene literature as an old one originally acted -- enacted in its present form in 1894.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.745" offset="6794324">But without any express requirement of scienter until the year 1962 which time the Kentucky legislature amended it to specifically require proof that the defendant had knowledge of the contents or character of the material which he sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.940" offset="6867153">That Kentucky statute with the scienter requirement placed in it in 1962 has been construed by the Kentucky courts and the authoritative construction placed on it by the Kentucky courts must be considered to be the instructions given to the jury by the McCracken Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.927" offset="6963075">Sends on appeal to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, the conviction of petitioner was affirmed and there was no opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.673" offset="6998079">There are highest appellate courts simply stating that, we find no error in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.938" offset="7023156">Therefore, if we are concerned with instruction given the Kentucky statute by the Court of Kentucky, we must go to the principle instruction given to the jury and the McCracken Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.498" offset="7077386">Now, that principle instruction, number one, is that the jury must believe from the evidence in this case beyond the reasonable doubt that the defendant as the owner and an operator of Read More newsstand did on the 28th day of September 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.944" offset="7159097">At said place of business knowingly have for sale these two magazines and further that the defendant had knowledge of the contents and the character of the magazines.</text>

            <text syncTime="2063.436" offset="8357073">The petitioner met with several ministers representing the Committee on Moral and Social Welfare of the Paducah Ministerial Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.411" offset="8389047">They talked to him about obscenity in general and in particular about this particular class of magazines known as girlie magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.516" offset="8417468">They made known to him specifically complains which the ministers had been receiving from the public in general concerning the sale of these magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.897" offset="8451009">And they discussed their obscene content in general with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.949" offset="8467205">As a consequence of this, he went back to his store and personally collected and segregated 25 to 30 titles of girlie magazines and put him on the rack behind the cashier's counter and he stapled them to prevent them from being leak through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.359" offset="8528854">He put them back there expressly because he considered them to be adult reading only and he knew thereby that they had a prurient interest appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.712" offset="8570232">This was sufficient to show that he knew or should have known the contents of the magazine.</text>

            <text syncTime="2152.504" offset="8713383">Now, I have stated there that it is a matter of Kentucky law if the negative of the principle instructions to the jury sufficiently covers what the defendant is raising then he is not entitled to a separate instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.515" offset="8757478">The time when he is entitled to an affirmative special defense is when he pleads at -- he pleads by nature of confessions and avoidance.</text>
