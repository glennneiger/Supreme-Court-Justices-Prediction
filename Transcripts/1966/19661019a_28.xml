            <label>Mr. Milton Kramer</label>
            <text syncTime="50.348" offset="304776">Mr. Chief Justice, May it please Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.702" offset="334137">In 1951 or there about, the Union Pacific Railroad installed a battery of new machines in its yard at Las Vegas.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.726" offset="378232">These were 11 machines of 7 types.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.034" offset="391502">This battery of machines performed work that prior thereto was performed in part by telegraphers represented by the Transportation Communications Union and in part by the clerks but it assigned all this works to clerks.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.211" offset="480214">Although we performed work, the midi fact was work formally by telegraphers in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.333" offset="512711">The TCU (Transportations Communications Union) filed a claim with the railroad claiming that assigning this work or even committing it to be performed by a craft other than the telegraphers was a violation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.612" offset="597870">The claim was in the words of every Labor Act handled in the usual manner and without agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.526" offset="625455">It was then submitted to the National Bureau of Adjustment, the very Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.015" offset="647398">We asked the Board to hold that having the communications aspect of the work performed by employees other than telegraphers was a violation of the agreements and that the remedy should be that each time it happened, the senior idle telegrapher, at the time it happened, be paid a day's pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.177" offset="744051">The Third Division gave notice of its proceeding to the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks which represented the clerks and offered them an opportunity to participate, to be heard that they care to.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.722" offset="806222">The clerks replied stating that they understood the dispute was over the interpretation of the telegrapher's agreements that is whether the telegraphers’ agreement covered part of this work and our understanding is incorrect said the clerks.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.152" offset="899950">We did not get a response.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.667" offset="910085">The clerks’ response continued that “if my understanding with this dispute is correct, we are not involved and we do not care to be heard”.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.792" offset="950523">They added that the rights of the employees represented by the brotherhood of railway clerks is predicated on the clerks’ Collective Bargaining Agreement and not on any other and that if at any time or for any reason, the carrier should assign work covered by the clerks’ agreement to employees not covered by the clerks’ agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.362" offset="1032861">They would take the appropriate steps under the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.498" offset="1049370">Now, in the proceeding, the carrier argued to the board, among other arguments that all the work was covered by the clerks’ agreement and they were committed to make that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.302" offset="1112586">Now the Court of Appeals in this case is in error in one statement it made.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.115" offset="1131813">It says that evidence of the clerks’ agreement was excluded by the Adjustment Board Rules of Evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.855" offset="1158771">Now there is not a word in the record to support that and in fact, it is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.041" offset="1179564">The regulations of the Adjustment Board commit anybody to submit anything it wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.434" offset="1201089">Doors are wide open.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.106" offset="1211747">About the award of the adjustment board sustained the claim of TCU (Transportation Communication Employees Union) used to be named Order of Railroad Telegraphers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2044.784" offset="8282467">It is our position, however, that ever since 1934, the Adjustment Board was given this power and the duty to resolve work assignment disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.706" offset="8330219">Indeed, this Court, in a very early case, the Pitney case, 326 U.S. was just as Black speaking for on that point a unanimous court, held that the N.R.A.B. -- the Adjustment Board, had jurisdiction over a jurisdictional dispute, and I'm quoting, involving the railroad and two employee accredited bargaining agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.143" offset="8467937">Mr. Justice Black also stated that the Board was specially creative to interpret contracts such as these in order finally to settle a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.570" offset="8521644">A few years later in the Slocum case again, Mr. Justice Black, he said that the Board's jurisdiction in these work assignment disputes was exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.100" offset="8619760">This Court in the Slocum case was presented with the precise dispute that you have before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.728" offset="8642330">In that case, the clerks and the telegraphers were each claiming, respectively, that their ambiguous contract covered in the work in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.841" offset="8678693">The railroad got a little tired of this and went into a New York State Court for a declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.491" offset="8713383">The New York Court affirmed for, I believe, the clerks and the telegraphers obtained certiorari from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.868" offset="8754866">The question presented there was whether or not the Courts should have jurisdiction over these type of disputes which depend for their resolution on an interpretation of the collective agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.996" offset="8803349">And this Court in Slocum said that the Courts do not have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.231" offset="8820276">But went ahead to point out that the Adjustment Board does have jurisdiction?</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.532" offset="8841488">Indeed, in our brief, we haven't the exact page, we quoted from the telegraphers' brief before this Court in Slocum in which they told this Court that the Adjustment Board has jurisdiction over all the parties.</text>
