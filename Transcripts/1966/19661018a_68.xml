            <text syncTime="391.394" offset="1668995">Your Honor, the main comment that I would have, Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.673" offset="1686026">The fact that we are not dealing in the case of Leon Spencer for the case of isolating significance of the rule of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.794" offset="1718523">What we're dealing with is, does this man have the right to a fair and impartial trial before a fair and impartial jury?</text>
            <text syncTime="410.001" offset="1743391">And if any proceedings that occurs in the State Court that denies a man a fair trial, would this be propensity of bribing jurors, people crying in the courtroom, anything that would have for the admission of evidence that would be such as to keep the jury from coming to a conclusion where then fair conclusion based upon his guilt or innocence and he is denied a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.852" offset="1838791">And then therefore, what we are asking in this case as in the Leon Spencer is he be given a fair trial before an impartial jury on the question of his guilty or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.282" offset="1876511">And it's not a -- particularly a question of whether this being an evidence should be admitted or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.326" offset="1896678">But the question is, after it has been admitted, is it such that it is rendered an impossibility for this man to have a fair trial?</text>
            <text syncTime="456.230" offset="1928338">And this Judge Vegas has said in the case of United States vs. Banmiller on exactly the same point.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.891" offset="1950908">In respect to the virtual criminal statutes and their applicability, we point out that we are dealing with a distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.948" offset="1975150">The danger resulting from prejudice is always enhanced on a capital case, fashion drawn high in the penalty is irreversible.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.276" offset="2004511">Certainly such a feed to psychological wizardry verges on the possibility, impossibility even for broke judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.593" offset="2029693">It is not reasonable to suppose that it could have been accomplished by twelve men brought together as a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.489" offset="2053308">The impropriety of the Pennsylvania practice demonstrated by the circumstances of this case is so gross in results in such fundamental unfairness is to constitute the denial of due process of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="565.210" offset="2364165">Because it's there that we'd be talking about the count, the death penalty as he talks about and that the jury in deciding whether or not will impose a life sentence or a death sentence, which is I understand it under the Texas law is the only alternative in the cases of prior -- second prosecution for malicious murder or whatever you call it.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.873" offset="2462908">Would it be equally invalid constitutionally to have a jury know about his previous conviction in determining merely the question of what penalty to impose.</text>

            <text syncTime="604.502" offset="2521422">Once you are dead and the State has executed this man, it's over.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.723" offset="2534275">And as far as the infliction of the death penalty itself, had taken another man's life away uplifted, it should be done on the basis of the severity of the charged crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.992" offset="2571368">But as the general proposition as to State's right to inflict a heavier punishment less than death for the repetition of crime not connected in -- prejudicing the jury on the question of guilt of innocence, that's a different matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.877" offset="2638869">And that's where our draw that distinctions perhaps of law without having to be truthful with the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1011.764" offset="4150418">I thank Mr. Chief Justice to a great extent on my argument has been outlined by the questions of the respective justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.989" offset="4183333">And if you would consider to proofread, I would like you to turn in read my argument around the questions that have been asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.540" offset="4213530">With this distinction, however, if the Court, pleases, I am dealing with a rather distinct statute in my piece – Article 63 of the Texas Penal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.531" offset="4261491">I am not dealing as we, and you are aware, in Article 62, the first case in the docket of Bell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.014" offset="4299421">In Article 62, we are dealing with similar offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.720" offset="4318229">In Article 63, the offense statute that I am here concerned with is Mr. Reed, the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.706" offset="4346232">It is a material whether the prior offenses or convictions are similar or dissimilar so long as they are felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.625" offset="4381863">I would like to make that distinction from the very beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.032" offset="4399522">Turning to the question that was asked by Mr. Justice Fortas, the stipulation, it has been concerning me, Mr. Justice, because in the first instance, it is no answer to Mr. Reed to say if you were tried some several years later you could have stipulated at that time because the first time it was authorized in the State of Texas – it was in the case of Pitcock vs. State in 1963 – it comes too late from Mr. Reed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.399" offset="4532955">And, I'm too quite concerned, and as I cited in my Brief of whether or not this goes in the charge regardless to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.917" offset="4570990">I can always say we have no cases at this time in Texas defining that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.707" offset="4594186">I do know, as a matter of fact, some judges put it in their charge some judges do not because we have not crystallized by an opinion of our highest Court but stipulation or no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.479" offset="4641311">What concerns me, there's something seemingly improper when I say that I must purchase using my 6th Amendment right with my 5th Amendment right by stipulating that I am going to help the prosecution complete an elements of its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.731" offset="4718320">This seems to be against at least my conception of traditional concepts of ordered liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.670" offset="4742040">But at least I have my conceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.134" offset="4751862">Let us assumed that there may be overriding circumstances of necessity in this balancing of the rights of society as opposed by the defendants in some instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.150" offset="4795956">Let us assume that there is an overriding necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.621" offset="4809853">It's the word “necessity” that bothers me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.865" offset="4822810">Is there a necessity for this trial-noted academy, not a separate trial on guilt or innocence but is there a necessity of one trial in which all is uneasy to get?</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.062" offset="4875577">Now, I listened very closely yesterday for someone to give me answer on that word, “necessity”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.153" offset="4911940">I heard nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.095" offset="4915702">I heard no answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.263" offset="4920404">And yet I, as a form of prosecutor, and every prosecutor in this room knows the reason for this “PC 63” as we call it, colloquially described as the “big bitch” in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.710" offset="4978186">This is what we know it is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1222.290" offset="4992502">It is the type of statute, the type of proceedings by which you cannot only win a case on an easy current or on a difficult case rather as to the current offense but you can also achieve, I believe, a high degree of pleas of guilty to weak cases or cases that you can't possibly try.</text>

            <text syncTime="1356.144" offset="5527907">And, of course, I'm aware of your dissent and it appears that at least on our minds, we might be in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.258" offset="5560404">But I am -- I can make nothing more than a frontal attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.001" offset="5579421">I've used the word “procedure” not as a matter of a magical word.</text>

            <text syncTime="1385.904" offset="5647026">And, as I see in the Reed case, if I turn back the labors, whether it would be procedure or substance, I see a pitiful accused, who may be wearing a white shirt of presumptive innocence but he's rather hotly battled in a crooked prejudice denominating from the end of the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.536" offset="5733543">With this be, what do we mean when we say a fair trial by an impartial jury under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States?</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.369" offset="5784848">I think in the past, this Court has managed to cut through the point, whether it be substance or whether it be procedure to reach the thing that bears down upon a citizen's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.335" offset="5848691">But of course, I say here the substance is prejudiced and there's some question and there's a reason here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.131" offset="5879933">Of course, this prejudice as Mr. Justice White suggested it, there is prejudice and I would agree.</text>

            <text syncTime="1459.590" offset="5941687">It is as it should be if he is tried by an impartial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.658" offset="5966033">This is the prejudice that I'm and concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.621" offset="5981811">This is a right that's guaranteed to him, of course, by the Sixth and Fourteenth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.406" offset="6001037">This is the inherent prejudice of being tried by a partial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.725" offset="6026324">And this is not a technical concept; it's something that's deeply imbedded in our fundamental ideas, a fairness in the constitutional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.208" offset="6068224">And anything less, is a travesty on justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.123" offset="6083897">I think this is the type of prejudice that the Court was dealing in a unanimous opinion in Owen vs. Dowd, where it appears to me that one of the most telling circumstances in Erwin was the express opinion that other murderers, other crimes had been attributed to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.059" offset="6163623">May be will here in Reed, as in Erwin, as in Marshall that there actually is no prejudice that exists.</text>

            <text syncTime="2733.027" offset="11035460">Mr. Chief Justice, may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.181" offset="11052074">We have here in Reed vs. Beto the typical old time habitual case, the three time loser.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.638" offset="11109961">This is – as stated aback counsel is not governed by requirement of the same offense and not governed by the requirement that they be capital offenses but rather that they all be offenses less in capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.137" offset="11163878">This is society’s attempt and effort to protect itself from the presence of man who have proved themselves undesirable and unrehabilitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.954" offset="11227199">The question arises now is as to why we have tried in Texas everything in one ball of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.629" offset="11257919">Why did we have one hearing to determine both guilt and innocence in the recidivism count?</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.436" offset="11289161">And I’ll give you the reason, because we had an order of trial fixed by statute which set forth exactly what must to be done in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.289" offset="11332524">It sets forth, “when you must read the indictment then that you must offer your proof, that next the Court must instruct the jury on the law, that next the jury must return its verdict and lastly, that the Court shall render its judgment”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.313" offset="11404622">That is a statute passed by the legislature and our Court of Criminal Appeals has repeatedly held that it has no rule-making power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.647" offset="11449971">Our Court of Criminal Appeal is a Court of last resort; our District Courts, our County Courts and our Justice Courts all have appeal going to the Court of Criminal Appeals and none of inferior courts have rule-making power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.297" offset="11508590">Therefore, in order to comply with the statute, which has been on the books since the days of the Republic of Texas, it was no choice on the part of any Court but to exhibit to the jury all of the evidence and receive one verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.126" offset="11579852">Now, the New Code of Criminal Procedure changes this not only with regard to recidivism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.885" offset="11610885">I would like to point out to you that recidivism simply rides along with the rest of our procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.406" offset="11637008">The New Code of Criminal Procedure sets forth a two-staged proceeding, this, once again, is a statutory enactment by the legislature wherein there is first a determination of guilt or innocence to be followed by one of two alternative procedures in cases less in capital to determine punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.348" offset="11716733">Now this is a fundamental change in our approach but it is not direct to that recidivism but rather is directed in our entire procedure in criminal law and the repetition and habitual offenders simply ride along with this change in policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2947.123" offset="11891858">I meant that the Court could not divide the proceedings in any other order and that which was set by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.478" offset="11921324">It was, therefore, impossible under the old statute for the Court to hold one hearing, receive a partial verdict from the jury and then submit more evidence and more instructions to the jury and get a second verdict on the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.884" offset="11982869">Our Court of Criminal Appeals has held that the stipulation is acceptable and when accepted, that the prosecution may not read a portion of the indictment alleging the prior convictions nor present evidence to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.798" offset="12050578">In the Sims case and Ross case, I took the case and called Mr. Grady Height, a member of the Fort Worth in Texas Bar who tried that case and argued it in the Court of Criminal Appeals and an effort to tear up to the Court since the opinion itself was somewhat succinct and difficult to understand and he indicated that their entire position was based on the theory that the Court of Criminal Appeals had no rule-making power and could not therefore force the prosecutor to do anything other than follow the procedure set forth in the statute unless the prosecutor choose to go along.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.142" offset="12235943">I’m sorry it happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.522" offset="12237511">It happened on my own hometown, Grady Height worked for me when I was District Attorney in Fort Worth and I hated I have to talk to him that way on the telephone and find out that happened that he’d taking up position that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.062" offset="12283591">Our Court rule in those two cases essentially that they were paralyzed for lack of rule-making power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.525" offset="12309504">I will report that it was not always our custom to that entire County and I don’t of know anything with precise with these two cases where that was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.548" offset="12341582">As early as 1952, I know we were stipulating prior convictions long before the Pitcock decision and we were not submitting the reading to the jury the prior indictments nor were we offering proof where we were stipulating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.527" offset="12409501">That prior to 1952, I don’t know because I was not District Attorney prior to 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.334" offset="12432697">However, it was a procedure that we pick up our word of mouth and knows we proceeded to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.104" offset="12447744">So, I know that for sometime prior to that, they had been stipulating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.550" offset="12465612">And I also know in response to Mr. Colven’s testimony about what prosecutors do and I was happy to stipulate the prior conviction whether you don’t prove it because in those days we were never sure we could prove a prior conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.412" offset="12525066">Since then, fingerprint methods have become so advanced that it is really not very difficult now to prove a prior conviction and show the record by the relationship between the prison fingerprints and the current fingerprints taken by the sheriff of the man who is on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.562" offset="12597582">But it used to be a very difficult thing and we love to stipulate on them so we wouldn’t be put to that proof.</text>

            <text syncTime="3357.958" offset="13535169">We don’t know what would happen if a motion in Lemony had been filed to prohibit the reading of any of these counts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3371.578" offset="13589713">Mr. Stanley Cork, who was the prosecutor who tried that case when this was introduced and admitted to this Court yesterday morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.562" offset="13625657">All we know is that without what’s asking the trial court to pass on this, without what’s asking the Court of Criminal Appeals to pass on this in the ordinary course of appeal, nor without asking the Court of Criminal Appeals to pass on this by way of habeas corpus, this matter was first submitted to the United States District Court to the 17th District of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.191" offset="13724087">It was three counts submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.640" offset="13729938">The first two had been brought up in normal course of events and that was the question of the method of proof of the priors and is not present before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.083" offset="13759718">But that was the reason they went to the Court of Criminal Appeals; that was the reason they initially filed on the Federal District Court; and they headed on, for the first time, to the Federal District Court of – I might had to put the habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.573" offset="13805693">And with the Court of Criminal Appeals, after it served over two years which is the minimum and once again, did not raise this question on that application for writ of habeas corpus before the Court of Criminal Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.471" offset="13849266">Then for the first time, docket on the Federal District Court and the Federal District Court did not consider it worthy of a hearing, a plenary hearing but this means count three with the simple short statement that appears on the record that there had been no exhaustion of State remedies and it was not therefore probably before District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.331" offset="13928678">Our counsel said we didn’t raise any (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.404" offset="13941008">I believe our answer to the application for certiorari and our Brief on the merits, once again caused these questions to the attention of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.221" offset="13988237">I believe this is jurisdiction in so far as habeas corpus is concerned and we haven’t given up for minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.179" offset="14012061">I’m feeling that this is improperly before the Court because they did not exhaust State remedy before attempting to bring this in the Federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.669" offset="14050095">Nevertheless, I will also point out that since it did originate as a collateral attack, this Court in determining this case determines whether or not there will be a retroactive application of any rule that might be announced, unless the Court simply affirm what is the case is, which naturally we hope you do in all instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.346" offset="14148733">But if you should attempt to enunciate any other rule and an affirmation if your apply it to Reed you are automatically applying it retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.848" offset="14194813">Now Mr. Colven mentions the 537 habitual offenders who were in the penitentiary on the first day of January or the 31st of December.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.940" offset="14255104">Even the penitentiary system does have no accurate account is because in some of these small Counties to which Mr. Justice Black earlier referred, the bookkeeping is somewhat sketchy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.516" offset="14297422">And if a man is convicted out of an offense where it is possible to receive life imprisonment, they may not include the fact that it was enhanced when they send the papers down to the penitentiary but may merely show the offense in life imprisonment and give the sheriff his commitment papers and the sheriff gets in his car and takes him down of the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.903" offset="14386970">These 537 are once that came from Counties that did show enhancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.511" offset="14409435">If, for instance, burglary is the punishable charge as it is in the Reed case, 12 years is the maximum punishment that can be given for the offense without enhancement under Article 63.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.727" offset="14458232">So it would be necessary there for the records to, in some way, reflect why they had a man charged with burglary that was in the penitentiary for life?</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.051" offset="14487594">And also, in your major Counties where they have somewhat larger stuffs, more people to keep track, they would have their records more in order and it would reflect that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.624" offset="14529912">There is another set of much larger that’s in nowhere reflected on the records and that is the repetition offenses which would be those charges under Article 62 because in that event, the punishment never exceeds the maximum possible punishment for the offense and it’s only in a few instances in the major countries where they show the repetition count on their paper work and then they just -- penitentiary opens the door and then comes a sheriff from one of the Counties and the man who’s got the maximum punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.671" offset="14658017">It could have a reason from enhancement or it could have a reason simply because the jury chose to give him the maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.865" offset="14686856">At any rate, it would be far in excess of 537 people in Texas alone who would be affected by any retroactive application of any prosper that might be enunciated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.985" offset="14739310">Now, counsel spoke of the concepts of ordered liberty in connection with his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.777" offset="14778493">I would like to speak to the concepts of ordered liberty with regards to society.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.835" offset="14798764">Ordered society frond upon repetition of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.109" offset="14815796">We started with little children and we tried to teach them not to do again that which we forbid them to do the first time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3692.909" offset="14875042">And if that doesn’t work the third time, we take a switch and work him over pretty good.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.160" offset="14896044">That has been the history of the instilling of discipline of any orderly society starting with the family and going on up to our national scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.274" offset="14940453">The effectiveness of enhancement extends itself to other statutes besides these three Penal Code statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.353" offset="14976815">Article 186 of the Penal Code provides that any County or municipal officer guilty of drunkenness shall be fined not less than $5 to more than $50; in the second conviction, not less than 50 or more than 100; by third conviction to the same offense, he’d by fine not less than $100, no more than $300 and be subject to removal from office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.400" offset="15068975">Article 527 relating to obscene photographs and literature or exhibiting any obscene book refers to offense of $2,000 fine or a year in jail or a both; second offense, penitentiary for five years or a fine of $10,000 or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.350" offset="15140760">Possession of burglary tools with intent to commit burglary for a person convicted of a felony under the laws of the US and the State of Texas, the fine of not less than $500 or more than $5,000 or confinement in the penitentiary not to exceed two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.945" offset="15203140">In Article 1555b concerning the presentation of a credit card with intent to defraud on the first offense is misdemeanor, punishment to the County jail not exceeding two years or a fine (Coughing) not exceeding $1,000; on the second conviction, not less than 30 days or more than two years and a fine not exceeding $2,000; third and subsequent convictions not less than two and not more than ten years in the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.732" offset="15306271">I submit that the principle, if applicable to the case, is analogous of the applicability to these other enhancement statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="4352.939" offset="17515081">Furthermore, in order to enhance for life, you got to make sure that the first offense was committed, the man was convicted and served time and then he committed the second offense and was tried to convict on the third time on that and then committed the third offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="4375.562" offset="17605569">You can’t freshly charge a man with three hot checks written on the same day and try him and then use two of those charges later to enhance a case into habituality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4385.886" offset="17646947">Well, it has to be a 3-staged proceeding in that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="4392.672" offset="17674010">Counsels spoke with a white shirt of innocence in the cloak of prejudice and I must say it that this people that come in in court charge with the prior offenses may have a white shirt of innocence but it occurs to me that as far as society is concerned, it’s soiled, and badly soiled.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.971" offset="17739212">And we have a system which is fair in its application to everyone, is applied in the same manner to all who get before the Bar of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4419.232" offset="17780276">For in our State has seen, and I hope the Tenth Amendment still lets us see it, we will deal this way with our unrehabilitable criminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4430.499" offset="17825416">We will not sent our boys to farm soil the faith and die even as they die, we give in the other great reminisce from within.</text>
            <text syncTime="4440.210" offset="17864182">We will get these undesirables out of circulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.882" offset="17882885">We will send them to the penitentiary and if they show themselves acceptable to society again, they may be part of our parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="4455.179" offset="17924054">But until then, the State should have the right to remove and keep removed its undesirable citizens and that would certainly take the thing that after we have followed the procedure for over a hundred years that we would certainly find 537 of the most undesirable citizens in the entire State turn lose because one man says, “I was faced with a prejudiced jury”.</text>
            <text syncTime="4488.968" offset="18059264">And yet, when the jury went into that box, the defendant’s attorney had qualified everyone on those jurors on whether or not they could disregard the prior convictions in determining guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4503.024" offset="18115480">And those who said they could not were excused from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4507.257" offset="18132407">That man had ample opportunity to qualify the jury and had they not been able to get a fair and impartial jury, he could have moved for a change of venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4516.176" offset="18168038">He accepted these things without qualification and without objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4520.973" offset="18187264">And now, he comes to this Court way in the end, and says despite what District Court said, despite what happened prior to that time, I want you to reach back in the past and turn me lose and when you knew, you are going to pull the flag out of a wrong and arrest to those fellows who lose and they are all in there having understood, after they committed the first offense and what did the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4547.568" offset="18293635">They knew what “repetition” meant and later they knew what “habituality” meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4552.570" offset="18313697">Everyone on the penitentiary knows those things and when they gladly commit that next offense, they do it knowing that they can be put away for life which shows to me and to the world they are unfit for society.</text>
            <text syncTime="4565.796" offset="18366568">Thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="4580.599" offset="18425814">I do would like to make a couple of remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4587.966" offset="18455280">As a matter of fact, if the Court please, I don’t think we disagree with too much about what he said and that this has been rehabilitation, we’re all for that and the civil statute, we’re all for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4603.422" offset="18517034">The thing that I’m disturbed about, as I said initially, is that we may have an unreliable judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4611.407" offset="18549008">We may have an innocent man who in fact was not guilty of the current offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4618.285" offset="18576488">That is what disturbs me and that is what the disturbing factor in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4625.303" offset="18604596">Now, he says they are all will going to turn lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4627.636" offset="18613896">Of course, that’s not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="4630.912" offset="18627062">They can be retried just as the Gideon defendants were, we tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="4635.868" offset="18646810">Now they have got an (Inaudible) burden here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4638.519" offset="18657468">If they lose, they are not entitled under the Texas law any of their back town.</text>
            <text syncTime="4645.284" offset="18684531">I do not visualize the favorite has anything more than a favorite dragon.</text>
