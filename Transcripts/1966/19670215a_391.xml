            <text syncTime="22.911" offset="195062">As Mr. Skopil indicated in his opening argument the two primary problems involved here and which I am going to discuss the question of jurisdiction which is two-pronged.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.459" offset="245217">One is question of jurisdiction over the subject matter of this suit, and secondly the question of jurisdiction of the persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.655" offset="278026">It is the respondent's position in this case that whether or not the persons injured in the Greyhound bus, the 35 persons who were injured in the Greyhound bus as a result of this accident had a right to proceed against the insurance carriers under the case of Brillhart versus Excess Insurance Companymust be decided according to the laws of the state and it should be pointed out that the State of Oregon as stated by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has no direct action statute permitting a cause of action to be brought against the insurance carriers until after judgment, that is judgment against the person carrying the coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.305" offset="440613">Furthermore the statute State of Oregon is even more restrictive.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.525" offset="461511">There are two statutes Oregon revised statute 23230 which states that only after judgment is secured against the assured may the individual then proceed against the insurance carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.248" offset="516368">The second statute 730 ORS 736.320 sets forth that bankruptcy does not relieve the insurance carrier of its responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.700" offset="562134">That after judgment is unsatisfied for 30 days then the person securing the judgment may proceed against the insurance carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.372" offset="592854">These are the only two statutes in the State of Oregon committing recovery against an insurance company arising out of a casualty of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.395" offset="620962">We submit then that based upon the laws in State of Oregon there is no subject matter jurisdiction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.519" offset="645413">The injured persons in the Greyhound bus are not claimants under the interpleader statute 1335.</text>
