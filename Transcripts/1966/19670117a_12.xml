            <label>Mr. Kenneth N. Kripke</label>
            <text syncTime="16.665" offset="169984">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.225" offset="192240">There's a vast distinction between review of a record by a trial judge and review on appeal of a code record by an appellate court and as I started to say in the brief time available yesterday, it would appear that that is what the Seventh Amendment is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.394" offset="284923">There is one line of cases running from Slocum versus the New York Life Insurance Company down to Galloway which was immediately postwar, I believe which examined into the effect of the Seventh Amendment on appellate court review and particularly on the power of the appellate court to reverse and dismiss as against the party who had won the verdict below.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.143" offset="415953">In the Slocum case, the Court was construing Pennsylvania law and it was said in that case, I think very flatly, that the appellate court has power to review the denial of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict but that the Seventh Amendment precludes the direction of judgment by the appellate court rather than the ordering of a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.100" offset="559731">The Supreme Court of the United States in that case eliminated, modified the judgment by eliminating the direction to enter judgment and substituted direction for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.725" offset="610304">Following that case very closely was a Federal Employers' Liability Act case, the Young case at volume 232 of the official reports and that case following Slocum and citing Slocum said that even though there is no evidence of negligence for the jury a new trial should be granted rather than the dismissal or entry of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.569" offset="733602">Then came the Redman case at 295 of the reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.683" offset="770069">Justice -- Mr. Justice Van Devanter wrote that opinion as he did in the earlier case of Slocum some 20 years before and in that case which construed New York law, Mr. Justice Van Devanter said that the Court of Appeals did have the power to reverse as against the verdict winner below and to enter judgment against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.482" offset="901308">The Slocum case was distinguished in the Redman case on the ground of the insufficiency of -- on the ground that the insufficiency of evidence question was not reserve in Slocum by the verdict loser as it was in Redman.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.999" offset="991378">Then followed the Kennedy case, Aetna Insurance Company versus Kennedy which followed Slocum rather than Redman and then we had of course the -- what I believe was a very important case of Galloway which was construing not the power of an appellate court but the power of the trial judge with reference to the entry of judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.571" offset="1113631">And there, even though it was the power of a trial judge which was at stake three justices dissented in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.130" offset="1147904">In that case, the dissent pointed out that in the English common law as reported in Parsons versus Bedford.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.734" offset="1194297">There was no right or no power rather in an appellate court to reverse and dismiss a verdict winner out of court that the most that could be done was to grant a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.064" offset="1243617">And that deserves some discussion because in the Redman case, the Court said there was that power and we discovered in reading the English common law cases that were cited in Redman that actually what was happening at the common law was this, that the nisi prius judges would go out on the circuit and try these cases with the juries would reserve difficult questions of law, would bring these questions back to the Court en banc at Westminster and obtain opinions from the group of judges, from the brother judges en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.363" offset="1412786">This was similar I think to a procedure where a judge on a trial level would call back his brother judges into chambers and say, “help me out on this problem.”</text>
            <text syncTime="337.122" offset="1451865">There was always the contact of one judge, always the contact of one judge on this reviewing body who was in the courtroom, who heard the witnesses, who saw the gestures if there was a blackboard, he saw the writing on the blackboard and he had the personal primary contact with that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.998" offset="1531382">In fact, in two of those cases Lord Mansfield was a trial judge and then he also was the judge who wrote the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.064" offset="1559594">I'm talking about the common law cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.927" offset="1567117">Therefore, I feel that insofar as Redman indicate that there was a power to common law for a -- an appellate court to review a code record, I honestly think that Mr. Justice Van Devanter was wrong.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="380.092" offset="1623751">Well, what do you do with Rule (50) (d)?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_n_kripke" startTime="382.583" stopTime="614.099">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth N. Kripke</label>
            <text syncTime="382.583" offset="1633677">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.649" offset="1637961">The postwar cases deal then with Rule 50 and I will come down to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.523" offset="1669413">There were -- there are four cases under Rule 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.697" offset="1686131">There are no cases yet under Rule 50 (d) of course but there are four cases under Rule 50, the Cone case, the Globe Liquor case, the Weade versus Dichmann case and finally the Johnson case that I know of.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.520" offset="1745481">In each of which, this Court protected the verdict winner in one way or another by allowing a new trial in each of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.284" offset="1780485">Now, in none of these was any constitutional question reached except that in the Johnson case, the 344 of the U.S. reports, the Court did note that there was discussion of the Seventh Amendment in Redman and in Slocum and it mentioned that in passing but actually none of those cases dealt with the fundamental question.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.255" offset="1876407">I believe in reading -- it's my reading of the Cone, Globe Liquor, Weade, and Johnson all of these that what the Court was saying was that we are going to protect the rights of the verdict winner below.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.752" offset="1934399">Now, we get to Rule 50 (c) and 50 (d) as they were brought in to the law in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.187" offset="1968149">Rule 50 (c) says in effect that if the verdict winner loses on the motion for judgment notwithstanding, which is made by the other party at the trial level, then he may file a motion for a new trial within 10 days of the entry of the judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.597" offset="2069713">Rule 50 (d) says that if he wins that is if the verdict winner is upheld by the trial judge on the -- as against the opposing party's motion for judgment notwithstanding and motion for new trial then he may as appellee cite grounds why if by some stroke of lightning the Court of Appeals should reverse, he may cite grounds as appellee as to why he should be permitted to remain in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.504" offset="2229373">Now, this assumes a great deal of foresight.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.291" offset="2252570">Here's the situation at that point as a practical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.869" offset="2266885">The plaintiff has -- well, let's say the plaintiff because in our situation we're the plaintiff, it's easier for me to think that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.245" offset="2288306">The plaintiff, the verdict winner has the verdict at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.816" offset="2306591">He has survived the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.922" offset="2323101">He has survived the motion for new trial and he has a verdict which he thinks is pretty good.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.787" offset="2346506">Now, as a practical matter he can order additional parts of the record and this no expense to his client and bring out a few or a great many errors which can be briefed and researched that additional expense on time and present a full blown brief on his side of the case which he's already won to the Court of Appeals in the off -- in the possibility and the possible event that by though he may be he didn't have the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.166" offset="2460087">Maybe he's going to lose it.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.666" offset="2470013">It seems to me that this -- if that is the interpretation of Rule (d) then you're better off under Rule 50 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="598.191" offset="2496136">You're better off to have the trial judge grant the judgment notwithstanding the verdict against you because then you got 10 days within which to file your motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.993" offset="2535320">You're better off than under Rule 50 (d) where you've got to anticipate all these things happening.</text>

            <text syncTime="682.431" offset="2833115">Well, certainly may it please with Court with reference to Rule 50 (d) it would appear that if that is the construction of the Court we have less right under Rule 50 (d) unless we say well we've got to go back to Rule 50 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="697.592" offset="2893720">Now, in this case the Court of Appeals dismissed us out of Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.975" offset="2903228">They didn't return this case for a ruling on the judgment n.o.v. or they didn't even say that for a judgment in favor of the plaintiff -- in favor of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.887" offset="2946905">They simply dismissed us out of Court which permitted us no opportunity to go back in under Rule 50 (c) even and get 10 more days within which to follow motion for new trial on our own ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.809" offset="2990582">It seems to me that if that is what Rule 50 (d) means, then the lawyers of this country have learned a great deal because frankly, I don't know of any case and I don't know of anybody in this entire courtroom does know of any case where any winning party, where any verdict winner has filed a conditional motion for new trial or cited errors on appeal which would redone in his own favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.372" offset="3100818">In this case, the record shows at least the testimony of two or perhaps three witnesses which reference to opinions as to the scalpel thing which we would not permitted to put any evidence and I suppose the question with reference to that is have we failed to protect our record by failing to point to that among other things in the appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1042.327" offset="4272671">I believe there are three issues that are before this Court of this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.328" offset="4292733">First issue being does the Court of Appeals have the power to do what it did in this case namely to reverse and remand for dismissal and as counsel brings it out in his brief that involves an interpretation of the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.487" offset="4357308">The second, if it please the Court is, was the exercise of this power by the Court of the Appeals properly requested by the parties and I submit that the involves an interpretation of the Cone case and Globe case and the Johnson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.079" offset="4419688">And the third, if it please the Court, the third question was the petitioner, the plaintiff and the trial court deprived of any right to seek a new trial by virtue of what the Court of Appeals did and that I submit and it requires an interpretation of Rule 50 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.582" offset="4489697">Now, on broad outline I answer these three questions, first that the Court of Appeals definitely does have the power to do what it did by virtue of the judicial code which we cited in the brief and also under the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.201" offset="4556152">I also submit that the exercise of this power by the Court of Appeals in this case was properly requested and lastly, I say that the petitioner was not deprived of any right to seek a new trial in this case by virtue of what the Court of Appeals did.</text>
