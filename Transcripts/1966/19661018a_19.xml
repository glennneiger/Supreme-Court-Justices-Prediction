            <text syncTime="42.464" offset="274244">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.389" offset="281976">This Court granted certiorari to review the conviction of 32 Negro petitioners who were convicted of trespass with a malicious and mischievous intent in violation of a Florida statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.540" offset="342580">The question presented is, whether that conviction violated their constitutionally protected rights, due process, equal protection and the right to freedom of speech, petition and assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.908" offset="396079">Where the trespass alleged was their presence on an open public piece of property adjacent to a county jail and where the alleged maliciousness and mischievousness was their peacefully and orderliness in protesting, both the segregated facilities of the County jail itself and the prior arrest of their fellow Florida A &amp; M University students the day before for picketing to gain admittance to the all0white movie theaters in Tallahassee.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.873" offset="547903">All of these happened in September of 1963, slightly less than a year before the passage of the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.266" offset="585415">The facts of this case, I don't think are in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.128" offset="604954">They established clearly that 200 students at Florida A &amp; M decided to walk downtown in Tallahassee, Florida to protest the segregated facilities of their own county jail and wherein their own fellow students were kept and segregated jail cells for having attempted to gain admittance to an all-white movie theater.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.654" offset="707041">They walked through the downtown area of Tallahassee and they arrived at the County jail grounds which is roughly – the record discloses, about seven blocks from the main downtown section of Tallahassee and from the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.347" offset="769735">They got to within about one and a half or two feet of the bottom step of the entrance of the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.534" offset="798574">At this point, the chief jailer testified they were orderly, they were singing “Oh, Freedom” and other freedom song and they were clapping their hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.154" offset="840997">He asked them as they got to within one and a half feet and no closer to move to another area, grassy areas surrounding the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.681" offset="883106">And they moved to the area he directed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.322" offset="905676">There was a diagram drawn and as I recall on the record, there was no measurement in the record and there was simply a picture drawn on the blackboard and someone forgot to ask the question of how far away this was.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.253" offset="949457">There is nothing in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.716" offset="955308">But I gather it's the grassy lawns on the sidewalk probably within a hundred feet; but I don't know, I can't point anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="249.369" offset="1101908">What width and distance, there is nothing in this record to establish.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.720" offset="1119253">What the record does establish, there were 200 petitioners and 40 policemen and highway patrolmen and deputy sheriffs around them.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.282" offset="1153526">And there is no mention that this blocked the sidewalk or the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.873" offset="1171916">So that I gather it was a fairly large area but the dimensions of which I cannot advise the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.350" offset="1257806">There was evidence in this record that not only did the presence of the petitioners and their fellow students not interfere with the jail guards but that business went on as usual on the jail, this was testified to both by the chief jailer and by Sheriff Joyce when he arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.843" offset="1331785">He was not on the scene when the petitioners first arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.263" offset="1349444">There was a delivery man who entered to, I believe test the vending machines on presumes of cigarettes of coffee and candy and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.720" offset="1387269">He was not prevented from entering.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.999" offset="1400435">Meanwhile, back at the Circuit Courthouse, the sheriff, Sheriff Joyce was discussing with the Circuit judges a pending lawsuit - this is on the record - brought against him for contempt for his encouraging the private places of public accommodation in Tallahassee to discriminate against colleague.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.966" offset="1484236">And he immediately know that this particular protest, the presence of these students at the jail, was the protest to the arrest a day before of their fellow students who tried to get an admittance to the all-white movie theater.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.440" offset="1542123">And he rushed to the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.970" offset="1552259">He testified he arrived and immediately checked the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.515" offset="1562499">This was his prime question and found everything was working along smoothly and undisturbed in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.498" offset="1602414">He then watched the petitioners for a while, came out and then he directed the petitioners to move to another area.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.940" offset="1640135">Again, no identification of what the area was, but an admission by the sheriff that upon his request, the petitioners and the fellow students moved to that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.564" offset="1686632">After watching for about 10 minutes, he testified he approached two people whom he called the “leaders”; one of them is the petitioner, petitioner Blue, one of whom was not a defendant below and he's not a petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.729" offset="1743266">And it was these individuals “leader”, who was not a defendant, who allegedly refused to advice his fellow students to move.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.894" offset="1787988">The sheriff then waited another eight or ten minutes in accordance with his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.370" offset="1809826">And for the first time spoke to the entire group of 200 students and said, “You are trespassing.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.037" offset="1852562">If you don't move, you will be under arrest for trespass.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.550" offset="1866564">And if you resist arrest, you will be charged with the additional charge of resisting arrest.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1799.940" offset="7304108">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.304" offset="7317588">In response to one of the question that was asked petitioner, the records thus show that there were some 11 people in jail, I believe, that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.603" offset="7350815">The jailer testified that there were four white women that went there for contempt and two other women that went there for contempt and then five Negro girls who were in there for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.146" offset="7393029">No, no, excuse me four of the -- four of the white women were in there for being drunk, for deed of the act charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.072" offset="7416644">So -- so these were separate charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.152" offset="7425003">So, the record shows that there were about 11 people in the jail of this town.</text>

            <text syncTime="1837.570" offset="7454678">I've been by there many times, Your Honor, I couldn't tell you certainly how large is the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.184" offset="7477144">It's simply is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.175" offset="7489055">Well, there's a juvenile home at hand and part of that is used by the jail at sometimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.827" offset="7507655">Now, this particular time, if the county fairgrounds, most of the persons that had been arrested during the demonstrations had been taken out to the county fair ground to a new facility that had been out there because of the over crowded condition of the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.997" offset="7580379">So, at this time, the jail was not anywhere near full capacity this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.794" offset="7619563">One other point that really on the record doesn't show and not having taken part in the trial below, I can't tell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.948" offset="7648193">I don't know what happened to the other 70 people out of the 32 who were prosecuted and the 170 or 74 that weren't prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.630" offset="7678913">The record isn't entirely clear on that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1899.612" offset="7702841">Could you tell us, Mr. Roth about how large the public area is around that jail?</text>

            <text syncTime="1907.723" offset="7735338">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.639" offset="7738995">There is a one-way driveway that comes out in one of the streets which is perpendicular to the jail and I believe it's a gravel driveway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.613" offset="7778806">It's a one-way driveway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.082" offset="7784761">I would say it is probably wide enough for two and a half cars or may be more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.277" offset="7805555">There's a little -- in southern terms a (Inaudible) overhang right in front right over the stairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.516" offset="7834499">And Sheriff Joyce testified that this was used primarily for maintenance men and also for bringing in prisoners, even bringing in or taking prisoners out of the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.661" offset="7883086">Sheriff Joyce also testified that Monday I believe with specially specific calls often times they had juveniles in there that had to be taken to the juvenile court or to the other courts in town.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.213" offset="7937212">But in an answer to another question, there is no grassy part of against jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.556" offset="7954662">In other words, there is the driveway and then the grassy part and then the sidewalk that I'm talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.376" offset="7977859">Unfortunately, this exhibit was not put into the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1979.026" offset="8020490">There's a slope there and then in another level I would say 10 or 15 feet higher there is another parking lot there which I believe they used for the county health people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.152" offset="8056957">And the grassy – it's all from here to one of the columns I suppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.069" offset="8076706">If that was, I would say the grassy area isn't that one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.910" offset="8092066">Now, this is where possibly we have a little disagreement with petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.032" offset="8108575">Sheriff Joyce testified that his men encircled just the people that were on the area of the driveway and not people there were in the sidewalk or on the sidewalks or on the streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.577" offset="8170747">Now, it is true that two of the petitioners who testified claim that they couldn't leave as they wanted to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.910" offset="8200004">So -- so the time sequence was important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.922" offset="8212125">Now, Sheriff Joyce arrived on the scene and supposedly he was there about 10 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.984" offset="8232291">There is testimony, I believe the reason when -- because we're taking that he was spending the time seeing if the jail was secured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.890" offset="8259981">Then Sheriff Joyce came out and noticed two student leaders and the crowd judge let this in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.072" offset="8292686">Sheriff Joyce did recognize these student leaders, leaning up against one of the supports of the overhang that is over the entrance to the jail area, to side of the jail and one of these petitioners White or Blue, I believe Blue is one of these petitioners and then Mr. White was not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2070.248" offset="8385369">The sheriff spoke to these people about five to ten minutes and imploring them to please leave and get off this area of the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.331" offset="8425702">The students would not leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.719" offset="8439286">And then, there was this testimony of the deputy sheriff also that the -- some other people said that we came to be arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.706" offset="8475230">Now, unfortunately, the record does not show which people said that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2203.748" offset="8919416">And that they're been stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.575" offset="8926730">Now, what we can't hint here, the question was, that this became a trespass when these petitioners were told to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.706" offset="8967272">Now, Sheriff Joyce also testified that there were three other adult women there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.469" offset="8990260">And he asked his deputies to ask this people if they were part of the demonstration or what.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.476" offset="9018264">I think there were three older Negro women and the sheriff, the deputy sheriff asked these people and these people left.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.963" offset="9048252">There were other people left.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.829" offset="9055671">Now, Sheriff Joyce's testimony is replete, that no one was arrested except the group that was in the driveway and possibly and the people that were all in that group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.547" offset="9102587">Now, there is conflicting testimony from the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.240" offset="9121395">Now, there were three petitioners had testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.520" offset="9130486">One of the petitioners testified that she was unable to leave; that there wasn't enough time involved because the sheriff only gave them from one to four minutes to leave after talking to the two student leaders about leaving.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.537" offset="9198508">The petitioners have tried to base this case squarely on point with the Cox case or the Cox cases and the Edwards case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.253" offset="9241454">We contend that there are many or several differences in these cases that are distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.119" offset="9268830">First of all, in the Cox cases it was shown that there was a definite permission given to the demonstrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.172" offset="9305088">From the very outset of the demonstration in Cox, it was shown that the state officials were trying to hinder them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.154" offset="9337062">Some 2,000 students congregated in the Cox case and were attempting to march up to a courthouse which also housed a jail to protest the arrest of some of their member and also to protest the conditions in that town in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.099" offset="9412817">Now, it was shown from the beginning of the case that the authorities of that city first of all arrested that Mr. Moore, he was the group leader.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.167" offset="9445104">The authorities then arrested the bus drivers that were to drive these students some four to five miles to where the protest was to take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.220" offset="9485228">Mr. Cox then took over the march and upon arriving, arriving in an area near the courthouse, was accosted by two officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.114" offset="9524830">Mr. Cox told these two officers his purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.766" offset="9539459">He said, “The purpose of the demonstration is to protest the conditions here in this City of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.620" offset="9558894">We would like to have a short meeting across the street from the courthouse which housed the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.274" offset="9585539">We would like to sing the pledge or the National Anthem, say the Pledge of Allegiance and have a little speech.” The police officers then said, “We don't know, you can't do that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.091" offset="9620752">Then one of the police officers contacted the chief of police and the chief of police met the demonstrators as they had gone another few blocks near the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.930" offset="9656069">And that time, the chief of police said, “Alright, you can have 15 minutes or you can have 20 minutes”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.296" offset="9677594">And after speaking for 15 to 20 minutes, then the police stepped in and broke up the demonstration with teargas and the next day arrested Mr. Cox for four violations, three of which he was convicted of the common law breach of the peace in Louisiana, obstructing a public sidewalk or thoroughfare and then picketing near the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.935" offset="9784174">Now, and there was a direct and tacit permission from the authorities of Baton Rouge or of the City in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.706" offset="9823253">Now, in this case, the demonstrators started at Florida A&amp;M which I supposed is about a mile from this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.327" offset="9849689">There was one word said to these people a whole time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.843" offset="9863795">Sheriff Joyce was in a conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.271" offset="9877483">Upon learning that the persons had approached the jailhouse, Sheriff Joyce came and spent five to ten minutes looking over the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.145" offset="9913010">Sheriff Joyce was satisfied that no one had tried to break in the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.805" offset="9931609">And I believe, Mr. Justice Fortas asked a question in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.357" offset="9945819">It is not the states contention that any of the petitioners tried to break in the jail or tried to go up the stairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.418" offset="9978107">As a matter of fact, the record shows that Deputy Sheriff Deckle, who was he jailer, met the petitioners as they came off of Godson Street into the one way gravel parking area and up to the porch or overhang of the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.573" offset="10034740">And when they came within two feet of this area, Sheriff Deckle asked them to stop and the students moved back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.876" offset="10067864">Now, petitioners contend that this was the permission given by the deputy sheriff saying, “You folks please move back so we can run this jail.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.474" offset="10110286">That the deputy sheriff and then the sheriff later gave this people permission as was the case in the Edwards case and the Cox cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3294.795" offset="13283537">Although in Cox, the reason that the authority grabbed it up is because they considered certain aspect of Mr. Cox's colloquy there or his speech there as in citing a riot or something like that when he said, “rolled out sit in these various areas.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.134" offset="13348948">But in the present case, there is no showing that anything will see it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3336.141" offset="13448944">From -- from the stand, I think it makes it worse for the petitioners in this case because in the Cox case, it was stated time and time again, and with majority opinion that these people, that the authorities knew what it was and given them permission to do it for a certain length of time that the statute was vague because they have the permission to step in anytime they would revoke it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.385" offset="13533895">In this permission, it just showed that Sheriff Joyce, upon coming on the jail, suddenly confronted, its custodian of the jail was suddenly confronted with having about 200 to 300 individuals right here in the driveway area on the side of the jail and this other area that he asked these people to leave, that the people hadn't say a word with placard or what were doing or anything and the people -- some of the people said, “We came to be arrested.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.998" offset="13636399">Upon telling the group itself to leave, some more of the group sat down and didn't leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.262" offset="13665447">Now, the only question in this regard about the true identity of these people and it was raised by petitioner is, that since each one of these petitioners weren't specifically and individually pointed out that they should void the whole way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.772" offset="13731485">I have three of those aspects in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.343" offset="13741725">Sheriff Joyce did give sworn assurances that the only arrested were the people right in the group there; that no one was arrested in the upper parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.904" offset="13779968">Again, this goes to your question of various jurisdictions, Your Honor, of the various dealings which is unfortunately not on the record, that no one was arrested on the public sidewalk of the jail, that no one was arrested on the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.383" offset="13829914">And it was our contention that this was – that the sheriff did this as custodian and that he had the legal right to do this and if no matter which group they did it, now or later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.594" offset="13878815">One other point that petitioners had raised is the fact of abatement, which is also true to both of our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.463" offset="13902221">Petitioners says that under the period of abatement, the passages in 1964 Civil Rights Act, under the case of Heart of Atlanta Motel and Katzenbach versus McClung that this should be applicable in this case which say that it isn't because this jail was not a place for public accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.045" offset="13988530">Now, petitioners responded that by saying, “Well, that was all part and parcel of the same thing”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.889" offset="14011935">Now, we contend that this is just not so that if the custodian of that area, of the jail, is powerless to regulate that particular area no matter who comes there and blocking this area that it would make the running of the jail or any other facility for that matter very hard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.764" offset="14111410">Now, the State of Florida has recognized, as a footnote and being honest to the Court, the State of Florida has recognized the difficulty of proving who was there in an area like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.448" offset="14166162">And in that Fort Lauderdale the prosecutor was in touch of the office not long ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.181" offset="14181104">And in pop in the beach when there was some trouble down there and all of the petitioners were -- where some petitioners were let go because they couldn't -- they didn't have specific identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.905" offset="14228020">Now, there's no report of cases where it's done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.993" offset="14236379">And the procedure now is, is the use of moving pictures a possible and other type of pictures as was done by the newspaper people or the television people in the Cox case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.573" offset="14274727">Well, unfortunately, we don't have this in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.715" offset="14295207">Petitioner also says that there is a lack of relevant evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.745" offset="14315374">We contend there's a conflict in the evidence as to what Sheriff Joyce said and as to what the three petitioners had testified said but certainly, there is no lack of relevant evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.478" offset="14370335">It was shown that the petitioners went to the spot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.042" offset="14388517">It was shown that the petitioners were asked to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.746" offset="14399384">It was shown that some of the petitioners or some of the people or the 250 that were there did leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.594" offset="14426760">It was later shown that the petitioners made no showing of why they were there or what they were protesting or anything of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.412" offset="14470019">And that the petitioners even or some of them anyway, even evidence had attempted to be arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.379" offset="14513904">Now, the state would cheerfully admit that just because someone wants to be arrested, doesn't give the place the right to arrest there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.600" offset="14546819">Now just because I walked at the place on the streets and “Hey, arrest me here, I'm protesting”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.535" offset="14562492">Or something this, if I haven't broken any law, this is no reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.483" offset="14578375">But I only mentioned this to show as a part of the intent in the statute when it says with a mischievous and malicious intent and would contend that that is what this goes to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.487" offset="14630306">The other point, which is the lack of relevant evidence, I think that it was treated the point before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.932" offset="14664161">And also, the petitioners have said that this was the use of “a petty criminal statute” to prohibit or to hinder people in exercising their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.586" offset="14718704">One of these statutes was not passed during any -- this statue has been on the books for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.830" offset="14739707">In fact, Florida has not passed, to my knowledge except for the schools which of course were unconstitutional has not passed any laws about or any additional laws in the last 10 years, making it unlawful to stand in a public building after being ordered to leave or making unlawful to go in sidewalks or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.040" offset="14812536">So certainly, by the very fact that this statute is an old statute, and I'm not contending this because it's old it's good but it hasn't been tested in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.823" offset="14851720">And certainly, this was not attempt on the part of Florida to use a petty criminal statute, just to prosecute this people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.540" offset="14882544">Now, if of course the statute is no good, maybe we should have passed some of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.925" offset="14900099">But we contend this was under the circumstance, the only statute that could have been used under our statutory law and may be this is a failure of the legislature not to pass that statute in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.701" offset="14943148">But the State of Florida has been fairly fortunate in this area and is not deemed it necessary to pass to allow the statutes which by the way, have most been thrown anyway by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.146" offset="14989019">So, it would really have been unused just to pass it and we're proud we didn't have it.</text>
