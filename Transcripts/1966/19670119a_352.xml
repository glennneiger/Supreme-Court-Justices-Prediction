            <text syncTime="169.343" offset="780727">And they came about as a result of the final plan and reorganization of MoPac under Section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act back in 1954 and this plan was approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.957" offset="1227212">The situation that developed under this plan was that with the A group holding 98% of the number of shares than the B group, they may have 2%.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.518" offset="1289488">It was perfectly obvious that the A, -- the B group was at the mercy of the A group and here comes the protective clause that the Interstate Commerce Commission directed, they included in the charter of MoPac and this was part of the reorganization plan and it was inserted at the direction of commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.537" offset="1393560">And the essence of this protective clause is that the company shall not do certain things without a majority vote of each class of stock to protective clause and the point that we passing on is that the company shall not offer or change the preferences and the special or relative rights of the A or the B.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.475" offset="1533262">Now this is where our claim for a separate vote begins in the charter, in this protective clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.093" offset="1575790">Now the respondents say that this generally voted clause doesn’t apply to us because this is a consolidation and the clause doesn’t use the word consolidation.</text>

            <text syncTime="441.498" offset="1869406">And in a moment, I want to show now how this plan, there’s a little more to it than that that does affect an alteration or change in our relevant right.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.715" offset="1922278">What the plan does is to issue new shares of the new corporation to the old shareholder, the A and B as though their interest were identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.999" offset="1987375">I suggested the A is a really preferred stock and B is a common stock and they treat us as though we were one, we are not, as I indicated already.</text>

            <text syncTime="549.488" offset="2301367">Now, this issue comes before this Court, now I’d like to say it very briefly in this way, and at this time because MoPac submitted its plan to the Interstate Commerce Commission, this plan and in December of 1963 before filing it, it held a meeting of its Board and authorized a plan and all of that and in January of 1964 it filed a plan with the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.637" offset="2449951">And in that filing, it announced that this would be submitted to the shareholders of MoPac that the forthcoming annual meeting in May of 1964 or at a special meeting to be called sooner, at which the plan would be submitted to the aggregate vote of all of the shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.552" offset="2549530">Now this made it very clear to us that the requirement of a separate vote of these shareholders in the charter which I shall come to in one moment was being disregarded, that we would better get busy and go to court and find out what our rights were and we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.588" offset="2641690">This announcement by MoPac precipitated the action of which the jurisdiction of the District Court is based on diversity of the citizenship and we filed our action in the District Court of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.254" offset="2700413">These complaints adequately stated the facts apparently because they were met with motions to dismiss so the cases hereon motions to dismiss the complaints, the District Court denied these motions, upheld our position and the Court of Appeals reversed and I like to state now what it is about this decision of the Court of Appeal that we believe requires reversal and the important policy considerations that were ignored we think by the Court of Appeals and our claim is parallel of the Court of Appeals in its treatment of Section 511 and really only the parenthetical clause of Section 511 which gives effect to applicable state law to determine the vote that is required, the assent of the shareholders as its put to accomplish a consolidation really any consolidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.978" offset="3007300">This Court has had occasion often to refer to the Federal policy of the Interstate Commerce Act to facilitate consolidation emergence in the national transportation system, but this Court has also adverted to the further requirement of Section 511 that there be assent of the shareholder.</text>

            <text syncTime="826.619" offset="3409899">Now, our case of course starts with this charter that I’ve talked about before.</text>

            <text syncTime="4626.645" offset="18609925">One of the basic problems of course was that it had this requirement of a master plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4632.421" offset="18633017">The other problem that was found and the commentators speak to this, is the fact that minority groups were able to tie up consolidations and mergers and prevent them from proceeding and all during the 20s and 30s there were bills introduced in effect to do away with the old provision of Section 56(c) which made this deference to the corporate charters and to provide a federal voting standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4668.879" offset="18778885">Some of the bills provided a majority general vote, some of them provided a two-thirds general vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4678.482" offset="18817337">The comment was made of all these bills were being considered under the 1920 Act, that maybe a majority vote was too low and a lot of the states required a general two-thirds vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.032" offset="18875538">Now nothing directly and immediately came out of these bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.555" offset="18901556">The interest died to a certain extent during the depression, interest died in rail consolidations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4708.829" offset="18938650">But these problems were very much there, they had been repeatedly put forward by the Railroad Trade Associations that the deferring to state law that was the old practice created deferring to the charters and the state law that was the previous practice, created a considerable problem and permitted what one commentator called troublesome minorities to block these plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="4740.003" offset="19063411">Now, we submit that when and again the last committee reports, when we come to the 1939, when this bill was finally, virtually passed, it’s funny enacted the next year. The committee reports don’t say anything one way or the other on this point, but we submit that on the basis of the classical theory of interpreting a statute that you look to the problem, that the prior law presented and this was a problem that was generally recognized, that the preferable interpretation of the statute against the light of that problem and against the light of this congressional concern is that it made a minimal reference to state law simply to the affirmative expressions of state public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4793.778" offset="19278451">The state law requirements, the most typical one being for a two-thirds general vote.</text>

            <text syncTime="4869.592" offset="19581785">These statutes giving effect to provisions of corporate charters were not general then, they were only four at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4877.214" offset="19612191">They did not really begin to come into the picture in great number until the Model Business Corporation Act was promulgated in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="4887.372" offset="19652838">We say further as our second point of federal law that even if the statute is read as giving effect to, well I call it voluntary or permissible vote under state law; it would never give effect to a class vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4906.044" offset="19727548">First, we refer again to the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4912.237" offset="19752312">The statute talks about votes required under state law varying the Federal standard, but the only way in which the Federal standard, which is for a majority general vote can be varied is with respect to the number of the votes of the holders of the shares entitled to vote of the capital stock of such corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4940.009" offset="19863385">We say that on its face this means that you can vary the number, you can say and so the majority of that shall be two-thirds or three-fourths or three-fifths that says nothing at all about class voting or about giving any effect to state laws that permit the vote to be taken other than on a general basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4960.908" offset="19946977">Now, there were in the late 30s bills before Congress, which would have done just that.</text>

            <text syncTime="5637.223" offset="22652217">And that because chapter 351 and its predecessors expressly excluded Railroad Corporations and other types of corporations from its provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5648.431" offset="22697148">The first statute in Missouri authorizing the merger and consolidation of corporations, not railroad corporations but generally was enacted in 1807 and that statute expressly decided said, that it should apply only to manufacturing corporations and that was allowed until 1921, when it was expanded slightly, but not to include railroad corporations, they were still excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="5676.111" offset="22807803">In 1943, our Legislature, our General Assembly revised the entire general and business corporation law in Missouri and put in merger and consolidation provisions and those provisions expressly said, they shall apply only to corporations organized for a purpose for which the corporation maybe organized under this Act, under this chapter.</text>

            <text syncTime="5727.185" offset="23012080">Back when our 1943 law was first enacted it defined the word ‘corporation’ as used in the chapter so as to exclude foreign corporations.</text>

            <text syncTime="5754.373" offset="23120854">They undertook to correct that defect in our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5759.268" offset="23140394">The Borrower Corporations Committee and the Borrower Association drafted and introduced a bill, had introduced a bill in our General Assembly in ‘59 correcting this among the other things, it failed to pass it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5884.675" offset="23642049">And I would like to point out how that section came into our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5891.284" offset="23668485">Our 1943 law was copied in large part from the 1933 law, the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="5899.352" offset="23700773">This particular section calling for a two-thirds vote was copied from the Illinois statute, which would be found if you care to look at it in 11-A of the appendix to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5914.305" offset="23760541">And the Missouri statute copied it down to the point, down to the end as it appears in our statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5922.740" offset="23794291">It provides, it goes on down and copies two-thirds vote of the outstanding share for a period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5930.218" offset="23824280">Now Illinois statute went on to provide for a class vote and Missouri expressly refused to carry that over into its statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5943.490" offset="23877360">I point this out on page 88 of our brief and cite no authority as indicating the intention of the General Assembly just before leaving to St. Louis, it came to my attention a decision of our Supreme Court en banc, unanimous handed down last month in Missouri, in which it had occasion to consider another statute of Missouri, copied from Illinois in which they had copied part of it and had left out certain sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="5976.080" offset="24007659">And I would like, if I may, to leave with the clerk, copies of this opinion of our Supreme Court to show the significance that they attached to the fact that Missouri had refused to follow Illinois in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5990.684" offset="24066069">I think that goes perhaps to this question of significance of Section 311 and the permissive word in their requirement, because here is Missouri affirmatively refusing to provide for a class vote on mergers and consolidations that does not become a policy of the state in Missouri to have class votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6020.621" offset="24185814">Now they come to 270 and they say that 270 they must, must come under 270 of this is the another hurdle they have to overcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="6030.511" offset="24225416">And the Section to which Your Honor referred in the opinion says that 270 doesn’t accomplish the purpose, because all 270 does and read the literal language of it, is to say that if in your articles, you provide for a greater vote than that provided in this chapter.</text>
