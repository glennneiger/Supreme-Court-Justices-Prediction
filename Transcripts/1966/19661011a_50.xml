            <label>Mr. Emanuel Redfield</label>
            <text syncTime="25.345" offset="204779">I represent seven magazines whose names appear in the title of this action, as well as their publishers.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.776" offset="254516">All of these magazines were published outside of the State of Arkansas and all the publishers are non-residence of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.444" offset="301119">Six of them are from New York and one is from Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.748" offset="330376">Yet, they have been subjected to the sovereign power of the State of Arkansas, for that -- for the courts of that state to determine whether or not these publications may be sent through the mails and otherwise across state lines into the State of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.823" offset="466631">An action was brought in the county of Jefferson in Arkansas, in a little town with 20,000 population by the name of Pine Bluff.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.610" offset="537788">And the court adjudicated these magazines to be obscene although they have national circulation and are accepted as readily as the Playboy Magazine or anything of similar types of magazines in current circulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.159" offset="644054">I'm not going into the question whether or not these magazines are obscene because of the limited review in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.144" offset="683969">I'm addressing myself to the statute and the record was made on the statute alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.469" offset="721272">The object of the statute as -- has specifically stated among other things, is to catch the nonresident authors and publishers.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.722" offset="790235">They state that in Section 2714 if Your Honors are following me.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.952" offset="815208">The statute provides that the mere sending of the literature across state lines into Arkansas shall be deemed a submission by the sender to the jurisdiction of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.666" offset="918026">And that a statute -- an action may be commenced by the prosecuting attorney of the (Voice Overlap) for adjudication of the obscenity of mailable matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.040" offset="987512">And I emphasize the obscenity of mailable matter because I think it will be a bothersome phrase because to me it seems contradictory.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.553" offset="1037563">The statute also provide with service on the nonresident office and publishing by mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.685" offset="1074134">And I should emphasize too that this statute as distinct from the one you had here nine years ago in the Kingsley Books case does not fix a period for trial immediately after joined thereof issue, nor does it fix a period for the determination of the issue as we had continuably books.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.943" offset="1575163">Now, as I said before, none of my clients are residents of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.809" offset="1610585">In order to show a cause was issued in February of '64, they appeared with an advisory jury trial hand and the jury advised the court that these books were obscene whereupon the court entered a decree declaring their obscenity and enjoin the appellants from sending or causing to be sent into Jefferson County the above magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.983" offset="1751333">He does not say which issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.520" offset="1757497">He just talks about the above magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.135" offset="1771917">That all said magazines shall be destroyed within ten days by them and the court retained jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.800" offset="1806608">He determined whether or not subsequent issues of the magazines may be obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.664" offset="1842030">Now, this is not the Kingsley Book case which I argued here nine years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.663" offset="1886020">It has certain features that are similar but it does not wind itself at all within the context of the Kingsley opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.974" offset="1955297">And I should add too as I emphasized before that although this Court recently in the Freeman against Maryland case sort of found favor was the Kingsley statute in a sort of a model.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.406" offset="2037008">In Kingsley, there was a provision for a trial one day after the issue was joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.239" offset="2068355">And the decision had to be rendered within two days.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.662" offset="2094059">And I suppose that is why the statute appealed to the court in the Freedman case, as we've -- some of the justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.324" offset="2132720">I -- I have not been reconciled to the Kingsley decision as a protection of the right of speech that is guaranteed Fourteenth and First Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.640" offset="2189981">But I know from -- I hope I know that I'm not quixotic enough to ask this Court to overrule it in view of what happen in the Freedman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.901" offset="2242957">But, as I cannot help observing that one of the features that you might have heard -- one of the counsel who might have been on my side say -- that he say that this sort of a procedure because it lends a certain amount of security to the bookseller and perhaps it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.241" offset="2356328">I'm pretty sure he's mistaken because I have seen cases, at least one case I've participated in where the -- moving picture censor, order of the State of New York granted a license for the reduction -- for the showing of a motion picture and nevertheless, the police department in the City of New York threaten the exhibitor because he claimed it was obscene although the censorship board held it to be non-obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.401" offset="2500942">So I'm not sure that there is any security in this form of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.454" offset="2541171">But some people as I say are always looking for security, I've even found people who find security in jail and they're willing to go to jail for the sake of the comfort they may find there.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.149" offset="2591953">But being as it may, there's a great distinction here between Kingsley and the Arkansas statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.922" offset="2647019">In Kingsley, there was no attempt to control the authors and publishers who were non-residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.496" offset="2681396">The statute operated against persons in the State of New York and the books that were found in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.852" offset="2734791">And here, there is no attempt to conceal the fact that they are trying to reach the out-of-towners.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.270" offset="2772407">So it makes the publisher and author in New York subject to the terms of this statute.</text>
