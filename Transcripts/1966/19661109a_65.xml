            <text syncTime="36.959" offset="251173">The central issue to be resolved in this case is the constitutionality of Georgia Code Section 3-701.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.590" offset="281684">This statute provides for the enforcement of statute of limitations against foreign judgments, that is out-of-state judgments, for five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.047" offset="319509">In other words, after five years you no longer have a right to enforce an out-of-state judgment in the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.337" offset="344691">At the same time, under Georgia law, a domestic judgment is enforceable and remains enforceable for a period of ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.997" offset="375411">We submit this discrimination in favor of domestic judgments and against out-of-state judgments is unconstitutional and violates both the Full Faith and Credit Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.277" offset="432462">Now, we do not argue the Georgia cannot enact any statute of limitations against the enforcement of foreign judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.200" offset="460152">We are only arguing that it cannot enact a statute of limitations which discriminates in favor of its own judgments and against out-of-state judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.019" offset="495470">This is our sole argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="354.066" offset="1519679">And so, it's rationale for them to require these additional requirements in effect requiring us to file suit on the judgment, but just because they can distinguish in this manner, it doesn't mean they can go further and effect more severe limitations as to time against us.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.579" offset="1673697">I have not compiled it on the reason that I'm aware because there's a quite a few state Supreme Court judgments upholding the constitutionality of this provision under the Full Faith and Credit Clause but in none of these was a question of discrimination presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.367" offset="1736808">All these cases just can any statute of limitations be applied and none of them brought up the question of whether discriminatory provision as in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.619" offset="1769827">But they are discriminatory since nobody have ever brought one of them before as I can determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.277" offset="1800443">We submit that the cases of Hughes v. Fetter and Wells v. Simonds Abrasive decided in 1951 and 1953 read together, in fact demand a finding in this case that Full Faith and Credit has been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.844" offset="1894797">In Hughes, the plaintiff brought suit in Wisconsin on a wrongful death action for an injury or death occurring in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.446" offset="1933145">The Wisconsin Courts construed that wrongful death statute as applying only to death occurring in Wisconsin and also creating a policy against the enforcement of out-of-state wrongful death acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.343" offset="1984763">They therefore refused to enforce the Illinois wrongful death act although all the parties were Wisconsin residents involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.309" offset="2024573">This Court reversed the Wisconsin Supreme Court and stated that Full Faith and Credit required Wisconsin to enforce the Illinois wrongful death action.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.156" offset="2068041">They found that there was no strong policy against wrongful death as evidenced by the fact that they allowed an action in Wisconsin and for that reason, they required them to enforce the Wrongful Death Act to the Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.555" offset="2117569">Now, the reasoning of Hughes weren't too clear, at least to me, until the Wells case was decided subsequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.515" offset="2149439">In that case, you had a situation where Alabama plaintiff was bringing a wrongful death action in Pennsylvania approximately one and a half years after the death of the decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.077" offset="2203669">Pennsylvania had one year statute of limitations whereas the Alabama wrongful death statute where the accident occurred out a two-year proviso in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.246" offset="2240345">The plaintiff claimed that the – under Hughes, the two-year proviso must go with the statute and must be enforced in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.841" offset="2286738">This Court refused to follow Hughes to that extent because of the fact they stated that Pennsylvania applied her one-year statute of limitations both to domestic causes of action and to foreign causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.633" offset="2349955">I'd like to read to you this language from Wells because, I think, it's most significant language with respect to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.378" offset="2380884">The Court says here, “A decision in Hughes v. Fetter does not call for a change in the well-established rule that the forum state is permitted to apply its own period of limitation”.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.638" offset="2429889">The crucial factor in that case was that the foreign laid an uneven hand on causes of action arising within and without the forum state.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.735" offset="2470327">Causes of action arising in sister states were discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.585" offset="2485687">Here, Pennsylvania applies a one-year limitation to all wrongful death actions wherever they may arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.352" offset="2508779">In other words, if Pennsylvania had a one-year limitation for out-of-state causes of action and a two-year limitation for its own, then clearly, in Wells by would not have been allowed to apply that statute of limitations, but here, they applied a one-year statute to all causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.476" offset="2581295">We submit that Georgia has discriminated as was contemplated in Wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.878" offset="2610866">They have applied a five-year statute against foreign judgment on a ten-year statute against their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.692" offset="2638137">Now, Hughes and Wells both dealt that with ordinary causes of action and I don't think it's questioned that the enforcement of Full Faith and Credit Clause has been much more stringent with respect to judgments rather than causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.354" offset="2720789">It's been much more astringent provisions and cases were much stronger with respect to judgments and a rightly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.181" offset="2764048">So, for this reason, if this rule applied in Hughes and Wells to ordinary causes of action, it certainly would apply to judgments because judgments are given so much greater protection under the Full Faith and Credit Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.631" offset="2821935">Now, I would like to point out that this very same statute has been before this Court in 1836 in M'Elmoyle v. Cohen.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.056" offset="2867597">In that case, the Supreme Court held that the statute did not violate Full Faith and Credit but in that case, the question of discrimination was not presented to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.609" offset="2909811">Now, all that was held in that case, we submit that was that a reasonable statute of limitations can be applied to the foreign judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.221" offset="2976266">This case went off on the procedural -- the fact that the Court said the procedural limitations could be placed on the enforcement of judgments whereas the merits of a judgment could not be attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.035" offset="3027466">Later cases have subsequently restricted this procedural rule to affect to able to say that only procedural limitations can only be placed on the enforcement of foreign judgments if they do not discriminate, I think, the fact that this procedural rule has been so limited as brought out by the Kenney case where a statute of limit -- there was a statute construed as depriving the forum state of jurisdiction of a right to enforce the judgment from another state with respect to a wrongful death action.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.492" offset="3169364">The Supreme Court held in that case that the forum state could not get around its constitutional obligation by a mere device of withdrawing jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.308" offset="3212622">And in the Hughes case, it was once again announced that this device could not be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.524" offset="3237491">In Hughes, it was stated, it's well settled, that this Wisconsin cannot escape its constitutional obligations by the simple device of removing jurisdiction from Courts otherwise, competence by Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.121" offset="3291826">Hughes, of course meant that what courts otherwise dealt with this type of cause of action, they would have to deal with it, with respect to out-of-state causes of action as well as in-state causes of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1240.669" offset="5066062">Now, under the Arkansas venue statutes, foreign corporations could be sued in any county whereas domestic corporations could only be sued on the counties in which they did business.</text>

            <text syncTime="1661.859" offset="6750856">In respect of this case, the facts are quite brief and I would like to allude to the facts briefly and that is to say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.798" offset="6786591">Prior to 1952, Conway, the appellee, operated a trucking business in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.350" offset="6820760">One of his agents had a wreck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.648" offset="6829955">In 1952, he was sued; a verdict was obtained in 1952 on the personsla injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.823" offset="6862660">That verdict was allowed to stand until October 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.159" offset="6888051">There was no judgment entered on the verdict for some three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.816" offset="6906650">I say that that is sadly indolence on the appellant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.084" offset="6923682">Then, they waited another period from 1955 until 1960, more than five years before they proceeded to bring suit on the Florida judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.508" offset="6981360">That is some eight years, I would say, of indolence, but nevertheless, they didn't bring their suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.775" offset="7010513">And in answer to Mr. Justice Fortas' question, “What is the procedure”?</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.961" offset="7035173">This suit consisted of one page, a one-page petition with procex, merely alleging the parties, that Conway was a resident of Georgia, that he had obtained the judgment in Florida for X dollars, wherefore and prayed for of the Georgia judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.671" offset="7110092">They waited five years, more than five years to do this, but they did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.944" offset="7127124">At that time, we then, by virtue of this code Section 3-701 which is now the question, we filed a plea of statute of limitations as provided by this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.379" offset="7180936">Motion for summary judgment was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.898" offset="7190967">The superior court of Fulton County, Georgia granted the motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.748" offset="7210402">The appellant appealed it to the Supreme Court of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.749" offset="7222418">The Supreme Court of Georgia upheld the constitutionality of our statute and hence, the appellant is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.542" offset="7253556">I would like to say this briefly that is, as far as the U.S. cases are concerned in Beacon versus Harwood, 20 Harwood page 22, Sherman versus Cutsley in Illinois, Make versus Meek, Iowa, Talyor versus Joe in Louisiana, Little versus McVeigh, New Jersey and Pear versus Gibb, South Carolina, Praia versus Moore from Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.187" offset="7392110">This principle of law was held in each of those cases and I have the page citations cited in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.316" offset="7424606">“Full and Faith Credit to be given judgments of other states is not voilated by reasonable period of limitation upon the bringing of said suits”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.366" offset="7484792">Then of course, I consider these landmark cases, the Great Western Telegraph versus Purdy in 162 U.S. page 329, Metcalf versus City of Watertown, 153 U.S. of 671.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.421" offset="7553024">As I cited in my brief, it is well-established that a statute limiting the time within which an action may be brought on a judgment of the court of a sister state, does not voilate the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.277" offset="7644453">So we have those recent holdings as a guideline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.166" offset="7660022">Then, of course, we cite in our brief additional cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.466" offset="7677262">For instance, Randoff versus King, a 104 federal cases 11560 and various other cases, including a case from Tennessee which is (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.709" offset="7734209">And (Inaudible) actually antedated the McElmoyle versus Cohen, 38 US, page 312 and there this principle of law was adhered to as I set forth in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.490" offset="7801292">The contention that the statute of limitations as to a suit on a foreign judgment violated the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the federal constitution has been expressly overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.359" offset="7856776">So, we have a number of the authoritiries that our definite guidelines so far as the issue raised in his question no. 1 as cited in his brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1982.584" offset="8033677">Certainly, the forum state can apply its own statute of limitations as to a foreign judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.039" offset="8067532">Now, in this M'Elmoyle case versus Cohen, the Court in making this holding based its reasoning that the statute of limitations was a plea to the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.443" offset="8141093">It was not a plea to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.884" offset="8154885">It is a procedural proposition and consequently, would bar the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.283" offset="8180485">Now, my brother, he cites the Wells cases and the Simons cases, but that is an entirely different proposition and I so argued on my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.957" offset="8227192">He's talking about there about a case involving the merits as to whether or not they would have the right to bring a tort action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.681" offset="8258121">Here, this is entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.204" offset="8268152">We're talking about a procedural matter, a question going to the remedy not merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.389" offset="8296887">Now, I think that so far as the holdings of this court, the holdings of the many cases throughout the several states that has the effect of the fact that it is not violated by the Full Faith and Credit, defer the fact that we do have the right as a state to impose a period of limitation upon foreign judgments as a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.266" offset="8424469">There's no disfavouring there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.228" offset="8436276">It applies to all such foreign judgments, none excluding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.101" offset="8455816">Now, in getting into the question about the period of limitations, I have set forth in my brief and quote the exact code sections of our law respecting the statute of limitations so that there be no question about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.642" offset="8525928">Insofar as domestic judgments are concerned, if we have a Georgia domestic judgment, the period of limitation is seven years period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.544" offset="8569501">Now, after that period of seven years, this judgment becomes dormant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.386" offset="8600952">I will further say that during this period, anytime within three years, the judgment holder can then bring a petition or writ of scire facias and in this three-year dormant period, may revive his dormant seven-year old judgment for an additional three-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.253" offset="8692381">Now, getting away from that proposition so far as the domestic judgment is concerned, let's take the Georgia judgment of seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.793" offset="8734595">If this holder of the judgment causes it to be levied and an entry of the sheriff made upon the Georgia judgment and placed upon the general execution docket, then that state of facts would revive the judgment for seven years without the necessity of bringing the writ of scire facias.</text>

            <text syncTime="2202.448" offset="8913168">I would assume that technically it would be such defenses that would be only as to a judgment such as fraud in his procurement and things of those natures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.007" offset="8951411">Now, then so much for the periods of limitation our domestic judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.685" offset="8982131">Now, as to all foreign judgments, our statute provides a reasonable period of time: five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.911" offset="9010970">I called to the Court's attention as I have cited in the brief the case of (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.791" offset="9038555">This case arose from the state of Mississippi and this Court held that to be unconstitutional and the reason and justly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.747" offset="9082337">The period of limitation on foreign judgments in the State of Mississippi is cited in the (Inaudible) case was merely three months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.084" offset="9115669">Certainly, it should have been declared unconstitutional because the time was certainly not reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.005" offset="9143359">But we submit that the five-year period as to all such foreign judgments is certainly reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.679" offset="9166137">Here, we have an indolent appellant that is wasted eight years and the only thing they do now is seek to attack our code section as being unconstitutional unquestionably as we are again our brief by reason of that indolence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.032" offset="9243460">So we say that here we have a question of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.146" offset="9267911">Here we have a question of remedy and not a question of merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.210" offset="9296227">So then, would it not be proper to ask the question insofar as this state statute is concerned?</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.822" offset="9330709">Is it reasonable in character?</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.912" offset="9343039">Is five years a reasonable time?</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.117" offset="9351816">We contend vigorously that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.497" offset="9365400">Take for instance this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.877" offset="9378879">I cited in the motion to affirm the fact that in Florida from whence this judgment comes, Florida limitation period on domestic judgments is 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.081" offset="9431646">Their period of limitation on foreign judgments is seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.545" offset="9449514">Now, even taken by their own state, Georgia from a presented standpoint is far more magnanimous in its period of time than Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.328" offset="9500714">That's five as compared to seven.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.799" offset="9510536">So, we say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.901" offset="9519000">We say that our code section of five years is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.757" offset="9546376">It certainly affords a period of time, a reasonable period of time in which the appellant to bring such a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.838" offset="9574693">We say this that the appellant in his brief has stated, surely you have the right to pass such a statute that has been no question raised – pointed out in my brother's brief wherein the statute of five years is unreasonable, no; that the state of Georgia has no right to pass such a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.791" offset="9682526">I might say in closing that these particular statutes are very common throughout the nation and justly so, so that a man may know where his plea stands so far as his rights are concerned and his responsibilities and in these numbers of states of the union in which I have cited wherein it is not violative of the Full Faith and Credit, we say that it is not discriminatory nor has the appellant pointed in any particular phase wherein it is discriminatory and we, therefore, ask this Honorable Court to declare this code section constitutional.</text>
