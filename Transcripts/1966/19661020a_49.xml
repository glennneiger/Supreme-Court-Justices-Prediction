            <text syncTime="15.256" offset="164446">Yesterday afternoon I pointed out that from the consumer's point of view and the question of whether the abandonment is initiated by Pipe Line or a producer is essentially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.619" offset="233827">United has suggested that if the Pipe Line purchaser initiate a -- abandons facilities that approval may not be needed because Pipe Lines have a self-interest in keeping prices down.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.642" offset="313971">This may very well be true in some situation and we do not say it isn't but certainly the history of regulation does not suggest as this Court very well knows that the public inadequately protected by the contracting practices of Pipe Lines time and time again the Commission in this Court have found that the contract entered into by Pipe Line have resulted in excess of prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.911" offset="431000">In addition to this, I would suggest that the holding in the Sunray case that the Commission should be free to consider all the factors relating to an abandonment before granting a producer approval to take gas which has previously been committed out of the market.</text>

            <text syncTime="1222.717" offset="4994278">The Commission cannot require a producer to initiate a sale but still it's well established that the Commission can require the continuation of the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.501" offset="5037328">The point is that after a service has been initiated there are many other interests which become affected and therefore the abandonment provision attached for the reason that public protection is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.368" offset="5108799">I should also point out that when the Gas Act was originally passed in 1938, the abandonment provision existed as they do now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.417" offset="5149027">They did not - the Act at that time contained very limited certificate provisions so that most sales were initiated without any certificate approval but nevertheless once the service is commenced they could not be withdrawn without Commission approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.438" offset="5221125">Finally, in this respect a reference is made to the fact that prior to the passage of the Gas Act a bill had been proposed to the Congress it's HR 5711 which related to or which referred specifically to pipeline purchasers and that therefore and that since no such reference appears in the Act that passed that this shows that Congress didn't want us to be able to control purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.176" offset="5352051">Fact of the matter is that that bill in terms they, the Commission jurisdiction only over natural gas pipeline companies so that the only possible way that the Commission under the sort of a proposal could've treated with a sales purchase arrangement would've been from the purchase side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.783" offset="5430523">But that's became completely unnecessary when the Natural Gas Act was passed giving the Commission jurisdiction over the sale as such and I think just that nothing in the Gas Act suggest that the Commission would not intended to have comprehensive control over the Pipe Line segment of the industry and that United provision would merely result in a gap and would not support full protection to the ultimate consumers which are the prime beneficiaries under the Natural Gas Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1638.769" offset="6658487">Mr. Chief Justice and if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.931" offset="6671130">The Government has dressed itself to the jurisdictional aspects of this controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.687" offset="6694118">I address the Court to make sure that the economic and equitable consequences of this decision will be fully understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.313" offset="6732675">This case is before this Court because in many, many instances gas for years continues to produce great qualities of gas long years after the termination of the contracts governing the gas sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.831" offset="6790666">In many other instances, the production after a contract termination is module.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.763" offset="6814386">The question from an economic and equitable standpoint as between the private parties is what rule should govern when the producer seller and the Pipe Line who buy do not reach a new agreement to control the terms under which continuing gas deliveries will be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.641" offset="6893902">A call or a question is what rules will come closest to creating bargaining equality between the buyer and the seller under such circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.491" offset="6937370">We must start with too clearly existing rules of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.224" offset="6952312">This Court held in CATCO and Sunray, that a producer must continue to sale and deliver his gas after contract termination unless the permission on the Commission to abandon has been first obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.527" offset="7009468">Now, whether we producers like that rule or not that is the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.243" offset="7024306">This Court also has held that whether there is no contract a seller may unilaterally file a rate increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.808" offset="7054608">It is submitted that it has no remedy and no relief to producer to have the right to unilaterally file a rate increase in the absence of an obligation on the part of the bar to bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.427" offset="7113122">The second rule does not hold the producer harmless from the consequences in the first because the amount of their rate becomes a nullity where is there is no sale and delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.695" offset="7162128">Moreover, this Court is aware that oil and gas leases are subject to forfeiture upon cessation of production over given period of time quite commonly 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.802" offset="7210611">Therefore, a producer if a pipeline can choose to cut off delivery underneath of time would not only suffer drainage and would not only suffer the lost of any return on its investment that might well lose its entire investment through his forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.012" offset="7287411">Well, there are no rule require to buyer to buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.293" offset="7300577">The buyer would have unconscionable bargaining advantage and substantial control of the interstate's supply as seller would be forced to take whatever rate the pipeline offered while the buyer at its selection could cause a considerable amount of gas supplied to be forever lost in intrastate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.897" offset="7378944">This Court should not condone a rule which will cause such an equities between the parties and such control over gas supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.894" offset="7422934">In the absence of a requirement on the part of a Pipe Line to continue taking gas deliveries neither the right to seek abandonment which might or might not be granted and which would be a remedy to a producer only if there's a satisfactory ultimate market nor the right deal out of a file or rate increase afford the producer in a dependable solution to its needs or even the needs of the ultimate consumer who depends upon these committee gas supplies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.959" offset="7575176">In rulemaking Section 7 (b), the abandonment section applicable to purchasers of pipelines however does not leave the Pipe Line without an adequate meaningful remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.768" offset="7622405">If it is the unilateral rate to which the Pipe Line objects, the pipeline is protected under the rate review functions of the Commission under Sections 4 and 5 of the Act and under the usual escalation clauses in the Pipe Line sales contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="3062.372" offset="12352867">We have an affiliate that produces gas but my point is if not necessarily Continental, there are numerous producers who have a supply of gas to that area and if they can arrange the city gate or with the big initiate to buy the gas they will build a pipeline right straight up for that city gate to that industry and they were selling to him and they're going to sell us, while they -- at the same able to tell us what we got the pay for gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.970" offset="12435205">Now, that's a problem we have to meet and so that's the reason we're up here is to stay in this, wherever they must.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.642" offset="12461955">Now, conceivably we can have alone some of these (Inaudible), we can absorb some of these cause of course.</text>

            <text syncTime="3112.654" offset="12554010">That if you come to us and ask us, if you can stop this purchase and our position is that we've got to ask you we're in trouble to begin with but there's no point in asking but the law doesn't require us to do it and that's really what we are arguing about, the way the Natural Gas Act is written.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.473" offset="12617226">Now, of course if we've got to ask some of it, if it turns out that the date of the abandonment of facilities means that they've got the right to force us to buy gas and we'll go back to that and I know what they're going to say.</text>

            <text syncTime="3153.650" offset="12717955">But the point is, sir, they don't have the power to do it.</text>
