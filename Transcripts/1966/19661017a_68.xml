            <text syncTime="46.920" offset="291088">This case is before the Court on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.907" offset="318986">North Carolina has filed an amicus brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.045" offset="335600">In this case, trial was to a jury and the petitioner was charged with armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.609" offset="365798">In addition to the allegations of the primary offense, the state alleged that he had been previously convicted of a similar crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.976" offset="403310">This was done pursuant to a Texas procedure which permitted the allegation of the prior offense for purposes of enhancing the penalty and obtaining a longer sentence in the event of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.133" offset="459943">The question presented is whether the state may enter use to a jury evidence of the prior offense for purposes of obtaining an increase penalty prior to a finding by the same jury and the same time of the guilt or innocence of the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.309" offset="536639">This is a question of first impression in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.104" offset="551790">There have been other recidivist procedures before the Court on questions of notice and on questions of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.567" offset="585644">However, none of these cases has had before it has brought to the attention of the Court the question presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.451" offset="617200">There is a conflict below in lower court authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.919" offset="639039">In the case of Michelson versus the United States, one involving the cross-examination of character witnesses, Mr. Justice Jackson in footnote 8 to that opinion made a reference to the possible fact that such a procedure would be acceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.534" offset="709465">However, we submit that this is not -- that this question is not decided in that case and it is unclear precisely what the reference in that case had reference to -- what that footnote had reference to.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.025" offset="775502">Now this case, involves Article 62 of the Texas Penal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.301" offset="800580">That Section of the Penal Code provides a mandatory maximum penalty for second noncapital offense of a similar nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.091" offset="839764">The validity of this statute is not contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.723" offset="854288">The policy provision of this statute is not contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.692" offset="870170">The only thing which is contested which is before this Court is propriety of permitting the state to try this in one proceeding and one hearing in which the same jury is used to determine the question of guilt or innocence and at the same time is informed at every step of the procedure throughout the proceeding of the accused prior criminal record.</text>

            <text syncTime="3017.462" offset="12173249">Now, in this case I don't think that a jury of 12 reasonable men could have reached any other conclusion where a man robbed the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.413" offset="12221001">He left the store manager and the assistant in the vault.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.936" offset="12235107">He had held them up with a gold-plated pistol.</text>

            <text syncTime="3042.558" offset="12273560">They were able to secure their release from the vault because it had a provision where it could always be opened from the inside, they called the authorities.</text>

            <text syncTime="3056.984" offset="12331342">The officers were starting to set up a roadblock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.661" offset="12345971">They then noticed a car that approached and then made a U-turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.131" offset="12367914">They gave pursuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.158" offset="12371989">The car violated the speed limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.269" offset="12384423">They stopped the car and in result in action in giving a ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.806" offset="12418591">One of the officers looked in the car and saw the gold-plated pistol on the seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.108" offset="12435832">They went through the car, they found the money bag where the money, the change still in them and the bills under the seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.694" offset="12466134">The store manager then identified the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.852" offset="12482748">He identified the money bags, the amount taken corresponded with the amount that had been taken from the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.640" offset="12525902">There was a case of actual identity and arrest just a very short time after the crime and the proceeds of the crime in the possession of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.570" offset="12565608">There was no rebuttal evidence offered whatsoever to explain these facts nor did the defendant take a stand in an attempt to explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.610" offset="12605837">Now, the only evidence that was offered in his defense was by his mother who said that she believed that he must be insane if he did it that he had had a head injury and that she had noticed that he had acted peculiarly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.676" offset="12666128">And that he had him treated or attempted to have him treated in a mental institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.210" offset="12692250">There was rebuttal evidence in the issue of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.717" offset="12706252">It's not -- it was given to the jury decided against the defendant and is not a part of the issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.783" offset="12746480">The only question is under the rulings then in Fay versus Connecticut is whether or not there is a reasonable possibility that this evidence by the inclusion, should it be constitutionally impermissible which we still deny and whether or not any jury of 12 unbiased persons would have reached a different verdict and I do -- I present to the Court that in examining this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.165" offset="12876048">Now the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas which is included in the record details this evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="5721.216" offset="22988257">I believe Mr. Justice Douglas, the defendant should be able to see it but the state has not mentioned in the preceding section 32 (c-1) specifically states that the pre-sentencing report shall not be submitted to the Court for contents thereof disclosed to anyone until after the defendant has plead guilty or has been founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="5744.869" offset="23082820">Then we come back to the mention of the Narcotics Act and I may be incorrect with my research shows that Title 26 Section 7237 as to the penalty on narcotics provides that after the conviction of the first -- conviction on the primary offense that Court has been informed as to this man's status as to the first conviction and said that a federal judge in a very well reasoned opinion, Haggard versus the State of Tennessee that the threat of prejudice is inseparable from such a procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5779.789" offset="23222523">A threat so real, so ever pressed and so immune from judicial review in correction and it cannot be reconciled with present day conceptions of the degree of fairness requiring in criminal proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="5809.985" offset="23343313">The state in its brief has said that the facts were overwhelming against Leon Spencer and that no fair-minded jury could reach any other verdict.</text>

            <text syncTime="5837.169" offset="23452087">Now, we come back to what if a jury in such a case believes that he's not the same man and for the some reason the first conviction is constitutionally invalid.</text>

            <text syncTime="6349.821" offset="25502699">I take it that that had as much bearing as the first instruction don't get it consider the prior one on guilt.</text>

            <text syncTime="6358.855" offset="25538748">And our Article 1257 (a) and I cited it in the brief and in the Baker case that was cited I think the trial judge was in error in ruling it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6367.952" offset="25575215">The jury had that before you and you take a case of this type, many cases like one of them in the case I remember says where did you learn the (Inaudible) like that, a murder case, a robbery case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6380.619" offset="25625893">He says, I learned it in the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="6382.773" offset="25634461">It was raised (Inaudible) where we lose the colleague it was introduced and it's inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="6387.509" offset="25653373">Another one like that says, please quit it and you get in trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="6391.148" offset="25668002">The man says I've been in the penitentiary before.</text>
            <text syncTime="6393.771" offset="25678451">This evidence is going to get before the jury in most instances and it probably -- it got before the jury but the judge took it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6401.908" offset="25711052">Now someone asked a question a moment ago on admitting a prior I believe Mr. Justice Clark, if the defendant on the ordinary procedure admits his prior convictions not a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6411.395" offset="25748982">If I may attempt to answer that question that he will be found guilty and then he may select the judge or the jury to assess the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6421.139" offset="25787956">They are priors of the amount of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6423.835" offset="25798719">And then the record under the new code is admissible and they will know of the prior convictions before they assess the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6431.938" offset="25831111">Even though it is absolutely fixed by law the legislature so provided that the jury would assess the punishment and now prior crimes on Texas are not admissible generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="6444.735" offset="25882311">In the case, that decided this Roxas versus State and that discusses our new code in the procedure on it which holds that as they argue them more and they don't want to take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6453.788" offset="25918568">I say this same rule is applied to capital cases and I think the Roxas case said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="6458.633" offset="25937899">And it's in 403 2d 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="6460.794" offset="25946572">And Judge Woodley in his opinion points out that Texas does not allow crimes committed yesterday or the day before to be admitted in the present trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6470.351" offset="25984815">We do not have that rule in Texas, but most states do have that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6473.588" offset="25997772">We're in the minority in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6476.005" offset="26007385">And Mr. Justice White stole my argument when he said this everything you put in is prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6483.095" offset="26035702">So this is prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6484.628" offset="26041866">But the evidence that he shot his wife is prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6487.374" offset="26052838">It's all prejudicial but it's a Texas rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="6490.328" offset="26064645">It's an exclusionary rule there of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6493.245" offset="26076348">It does not meet constitutional standards and I think that the Court Mr. Justice Black pointed out in Wolfe versus Nash is 313 F.2d 393 and in dealing with an individual criminal statute, this is Eighth Circuit and it says that the Due Process Clause does not and the Fourteenth Amendment does not enable us to review errors in state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6519.343" offset="26180733">And we submit that if this is -- that if it is an error it's an error of state law and it does not have constitutional prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6528.145" offset="26215946">Now, someone asked a question a moment ago what happens to this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6534.827" offset="26242696">What does this do to the extraneous offense?</text>
