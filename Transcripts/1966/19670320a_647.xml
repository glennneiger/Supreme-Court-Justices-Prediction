            <text syncTime="31.322" offset="228707">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.856" offset="254830">Petitioner, Louis Bostick was convicted of murder during the February, 1962 term of the Court of General Sessions for Jasper County, South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.757" offset="302373">The Supreme Court of South Carolina later affirmed that has conviction and sentence of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.111" offset="327868">Thereafter, petitioner filed in the Court of Common Pleas for Richmond County, South Carolina has petitioned for writ of habeas corpus, alleging that the grand jury which indicted him and the trial jury which convicted him were so conveying as to systematically exclude there from members of the Negro race of which race the petitioner is a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.038" offset="447509">The evidence presented on this question is perhaps somewhat brief but we think sustains the allegation that there is in fact discrimination shown by the record here that a prima facie case of discrimination has been set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.481" offset="525249">That evidence is that for a period described variously by the witnesses ranging from eight to nine years, only one Negro in the memory of the various witnesses had been called to serve on the grand jury of that county.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.253" offset="608423">The evidence also is that in 1962 at which time this indictment was returned, there were 947 qualified male electors in Jasper County, who were white, and that there 246 qualified Negro male electors.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.314" offset="684596">In South Carolina, jury lists are made up from the list of qualified male electors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1373.383" offset="5596871">Now, that is not to be read as if they discriminated by not putting Negroes on the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.067" offset="5623620">That is cleared up in my judgment by the later testimony of Ms. Farley.</text>
