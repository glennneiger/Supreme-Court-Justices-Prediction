            <text syncTime="80.995" offset="323918">The order of the cases, this is Udall on behalf of the Secretary versus Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.654" offset="354534">The Snake River is represented on the small map here.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.570" offset="378253">At this point, it merges into the Columbia River which in turn as to say goes west and empties into the Pacific Ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.736" offset="414929">We are concerned with the 70-mile stretch of that river approximately between the boundary of Washington and Oregon point approximately here down to the site of Hells Canyon Dam which has been licensed to the Idaho Power Company, as well as Oxbow and Brownlee Dam which are owned and controlled by that same company.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.132" offset="524434">The 70-mile stretch of the Snake River is an ideal site for hydroelectric dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.762" offset="547004">It's a deep gorges sort of canyon with the bottoms on both sides ready-made for the installation of a high dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.357" offset="585352">Yet, the 700-mile stretch will support only one such high dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.753" offset="606981">It is moreover the less important site on the Snake Columbia River for the construction of this sort of high regulating dam.</text>

            <text syncTime="164.084" offset="656300">There is petition on the merits on behalf of the Secretary, Mr. Justice Douglas, in Number 463.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.680" offset="710635">I should point out two other facts about this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.846" offset="723383">One is the confluence of the Salmon River with Snake.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.036" offset="740101">The Salmon River as its name indicates is one of the important fish resources of the United States of this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.048" offset="780121">Also, the Imnaha River to a less extent is an important to salmon sanctuary, fish-breeding ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.309" offset="829231">In this stretch of the river, there were considered three possible sites for the location of the dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.104" offset="856398">We're not disputing the Commission's finding as to the ultimate location but you will hear much about the three sites and I might as well locate them for you now.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.318" offset="905195">The first site for the high dam was called Pleasant Valley and was considerably upstream from the Mountain Sheep site which is shown on this map.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.122" offset="948454">It was accompanied as all of these high dams are by a small low-regulating dam below it which was the nominated low Mountain Sheep.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.986" offset="987847">That's at one extreme, but the other extreme was a dam below downstream from the present site called Nez Perce which was to be operated in conjunction with China Gardens, a small dam below it which is shown on the map.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="264.521" offset="1058064">What was the distance between the two?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="269.117" stopTime="369.346">
            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="269.117" offset="1076454">I think, Mr. Chief Justice something approximating 27 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.087" offset="1108323">The Pleasant Valley site being upstream had the least capability for generating power because it caught less water than -- than the dam further downstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.837" offset="1175301">On the other hand, it had the advantage of being upstream from the confluents of the Salmon and Imnaha Rivers and therefore would not interfere with the fish runs up those rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.132" offset="1232457">The Federal Power Commission determined not to license that site because it did not use the best advantage, the four capabilities of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.881" offset="1271432">It indicated in its best opinion that the ideal site was Nez Perce downstream at the other extreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.977" offset="1307899">The difficulty with Nez Perce was that while they caught both the waters of the Salmon and of the Snake, and was therefore ideal from the point of view of generating power, he did interfere with the fish going up to Salmon and the Imnaha River particularly at the Salmon River.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.224" offset="1376862">And ultimately for that reason, since they had not yet and still has not been developed any sure way of getting the Salmon over such a high dam, that site was abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.128" offset="1420434">And ultimately the Commission settled on a compromise which is High Mountain Sheep, the dam shown here.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.319" offset="1449273">And as I say, no one disputes the Commission's judgment in finding this site more points of view than those preferable.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="369.346" offset="1477381">Is the latter above the confluence of the two rivers or below?</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="373.144" offset="1492532">It is between the Salmon and the Imnaha, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.836" offset="1515311">The Salmon is by far the most important of fish breeding ground.</text>

          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="383.247" stopTime="383.873">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="383.247" offset="1532970">I see.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="383.873" offset="1535478">And there has been devised or hopefully it will be devised a way of allowing the salmon to come up the Imnaha by a canal around the dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.023" offset="1572049">But it does -- it is upstream from the Salmon and therefore it preserves that river free of any obstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.671" offset="1610606">Now this dam, the High Mountain Sheep Dam, which has now been licensed to the Pacific Northwest Company by the Federal Power Commission, is a very large dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.732" offset="1650834">It's approximately -- it will be approximately 700 feet high.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.616" offset="1670374">It will have a reservoir pool behind at some 760-mile long.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.374" offset="1693466">It will hold -- that pool will hold some 2-million acre feet of usable storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.405" offset="1721574">It will be a project second to none in the Columbia River Basin with a single exception of Grand Coulee Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.846" offset="1759295">Because of its size and its location, this dam across has a capability of producing a very important amount of power but it also has other very important potentials.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.329" offset="1821257">It has potential for flood control by releasing or holding back the very seasonal waters of the Snake River.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.021" offset="1860023">It has a potential perfecting navigation one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.291" offset="1877159">It also has possibilities in the area of water quality control, irrigation and finally recreation.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.786" offset="1915089">There's one other fact which to us is the most important which is that by its location and because of its size, it will dominate all the dams downstream on the Snake and the Columbia River.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.640" offset="1982485">That is shown more graphically on this pert chart.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.513" offset="2002024">Here is High Mountain Sheep in red and here are nine dams below it, all of which depend on the flow of the river and their availability of water will depend on the releases which this high dam makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.169" offset="2064614">Now, as it happens, those nine dams below the site which has now been licensed to this private power company, all federal dams owned and operated by the United States through the Corps of Engineers in collaboration with the Department of the Interior.</text>

            <text syncTime="540.682" offset="2162625">It was authorized for federal construction when the examiner in this case indicated that High Mountain Sheep would be recommended for private development, the Congress deauthorized China Gardens assuming that each should go in tandem with High Mountain Sheep.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.246" offset="2240888">China Gardens, however, is not at issue before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.076" offset="2256248">Perhaps the assumption is that it will go as High Mountain Sheep levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.152" offset="2284565">I have also distributed to the members of the Court this morning through the clerk the -- an abbreviated chronology of the events in this case, hopefully to spare the Court the need to hear a full recitation of the rather involved proceedings that have taken place in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.133" offset="2396473">Basically, there were two -- well three proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.901" offset="2423536">The first was a proceeding by the present licensee the Pacific Northwest to obtain the license for the first site I spoke of, Pleasant Valley.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.868" offset="2479438">That was in 1954, they got a preliminary permit, they applied for a license, that license -- preliminary permit was granted, the license was denied ultimately by the Commission and it was denied largely on the ground that this was too far upstream and did not fully utilized the resources of the stretch of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.234" offset="2560836">The Commission at that time indicating that it would license a project which included Nez Perce much farther downstream but not this Pleasant Valley site which did not utilize the river to its fullest.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.366" offset="2625411">Accordingly, a new application was made by Pacific Northwest but not for the Nez Perce, for this intermediate site of High Mountain Sheep.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.679" offset="2678700">Sometime later, the other petitioner here in the next case, Washington Public Power, filed its own application for Nez Perce.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.969" offset="2723840">At its request, the Commission consolidated these two proceedings and held a comparative hearing on the two applicants and the two sites.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.262" offset="2768980">The Secretary of Interior had been asked by the Commission to comment on these two applications and he suggested the deferral of the whole licensing matter until the fish problem could be resolved, also asserting that there was no present need for power in the area and therefore no occasion to grant a license of this term.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.098" offset="2888307">Ultimately, the examiner recommended for this High Mountain Sheep site, the Secretary at that point moved to intervene in the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.030" offset="2940029">He was granted leave to file exemptions to the examiner's report in no other sense was his intervention active.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.713" offset="2990811">He did file exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.956" offset="2999798">The Commission ultimately agreed with the examiner and licensed this project of High Mountain Sheep to the private power company of Pacific Northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.732" offset="3038877">At that point, the Secretary asked the proceedings to be reopened so that he might present evidence as to the superiority of federal development of this site.</text>

            <text syncTime="1307.085" offset="5228251">In other words, the Secretary's partial default here makes the Commission's failure to assess federal development more understandable but it does not excuse that default.</text>

            <text syncTime="1337.401" offset="5349564">Now, on the other hand, we are not insisting, we are not trying to bring the Commission to book here simply to vindicate the principle of the administrative regularity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.851" offset="5395331">That isn't an unimportant goal but there's more at stake here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.299" offset="5417169">It seems to that here of all times the failure to look searchingly at the alternative of federal development is not harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.713" offset="5462831">In another case, that we were dealing with a small run of the river dam, on the stretch of the river that had no other potential, we might overlook the failure of the Commission to look more carefully at the possible advantages of federal development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.910" offset="5535556">But that is not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.837" offset="5543288">As I have said, this is a very major project which has many purposes other than creating power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.009" offset="5579964">And therefore, it is of great importance that this alternative be explored.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.103" offset="5604310">And that is especially so because these other purposes, flood control, navigation, irrigation, recreation, fish problems, insofar as a private company must deal with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.112" offset="5668362">It does so against interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.260" offset="5681006">These are traditionally governmental functions and it therefore seems on the face of it appropriate that it'd be the United States itself which discharge these functions which operate this project is also relevant that this project will dominate these staircase of federal dams below and it -- on the phase of it again it seems appropriate that the controlling dam at the head of this cascade of federal dams be likewise controlled by the same operator, that is by the Federal Government itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.301" offset="5865117">Now, the Federal Power Commission didn't see the case that way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1523.263" offset="6093009">As the Commission now puts it, whether that's a wise policy or an unwise policy is not for them to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.933" offset="6131670">They say that of course they must be satisfied that the applicant presents a sound plan that when the project has other purposes other than creating energy, they may and must in the license imposed conditions that will or less assure that flood control and navigation and other matters are properly handled by the licensee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.806" offset="6231144">But that whenever an applicant presents himself who is qualified and who is willing to accept the conditions which the Commission feels it necessary to impose then he must be granted a license.</text>

            <text syncTime="1649.441" offset="6597695">And so far as we're able to discover the Commission has only once in all of 50 years recommended federal development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.588" offset="6634266">And that was in a very unusual situation involving an international waterway, the Saint Lawrence Seaway where they did recommend federal development and then the Congress have no action for three to four years and ultimately the Commission even licensed that project to a nonfederal applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.824" offset="6715246">The Commission's position does seem to be that when this qualified applicant presents himself and they must grant the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.092" offset="6756310">The decisions about federal construction, federal development of a waterway are not for the Commission, they're for Congress acting sua sponte or at the instance of the Corps of Engineers or Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.270" offset="6829035">And they add that if Congress is anxious to preserve a certain waterway for federal development, it can always preempt the site or simply withdraw the Commission's jurisdiction over that waterway as Congress has done on rare occasions as in the Columbia or as in the Colorado River System.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.120" offset="6948467">Now, it seems to me that this is at odds with the text of the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.828" offset="6975216">Section7 (b) in our view expressly puts the initial responsibility on the Commission by deciding whether or not the federal development is appropriate in the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.849" offset="7031327">It's reproduced on page 3 of our brief and it reads as follows, “Whenever in the judgment of the Commission that development of any water resources for public purposes should be undertaken by the United States itself, the Commission shall not approve any application for any project affecting such development but shall cause to be made examinations, surveys, reports, plans and estimates for the cause of the proposed development as it may find necessary and shall submit its findings to Congress with such recommendations as it may find appropriate concerning such development.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.507" offset="7182002">Now, it's true that this text doesn't tell the Commission how it has to go about deciding where the federal development is preferable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.655" offset="7210527">But it does very clearly tell the Commission that it must consider this alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.801" offset="7239158">At least it must consider this alternative in some cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.338" offset="7257339">And the implication very clearly is that there are some cases where a federal development ought to be recommended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.970" offset="7291820">Presumably those are the cases where the project says many functions typically governmental all aware here also the project dominates a series of already constructed federal dams.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.561" offset="7366217">Now, as I say the initial responsibility under Section 7 is with the Commission to suggest federal development.</text>

            <text syncTime="2506.463" offset="10025796">Now, the -- still in the sense on Mr. Justice White's question, the Commission tells us that experience shows that Congress will not authorize the expenditure of federal funds on a project when there is a ready and willing applicant from which it follows that to recommend federal development is useless gesture and therefore we will grant the license and that is the -- the approach of the Commission seems to have taken here and -- and for that matter imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.307" offset="10165185">But that assumption has never really been tested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.130" offset="10184516">Of course, the Congress under the scheme of the Act is expected to give great weight deference to the Commission's expert determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2578.943" offset="10315755">Neither having done so, it is unfair to say that the Congress is always unwilling to authorize the expenditure of federal fund when there's a private applicant who is willing to take up the project.</text>

            <text syncTime="2631.807" offset="10527138">And all that we ask here is that the Commission make an informed judgment on that question on the basis of that as it did not here and to some extent as it could not since the Secretary introduced no evidence and its staff introduced no evidence on the comparative merits of federal versus nonfederal development.</text>

            <text syncTime="3873.259" offset="15493016">Because as Mr. Claiborne indicated, Mr. Claiborne has indicated here this is a major dam with lots of storage which can and will and have to be used if you're going to have optimum operation here to coordinate not only with the federal dams downstream on the Snake and Columbia permit but with all of the dams in this system.</text>

            <text syncTime="3946.986" offset="15787886">And the witnesses on this matter recognized that there would be considerable coordination under the present operation of this pool but they also realized and faced up to the real serious problem that full coordination, optimum coordination, coordination which surprisingly enough but very, very true in this case would help both onsite generation potentialities for the honor of this project and downstream generation potentialities for the Federal Government another downstream owner.</text>

            <text syncTime="4076.926" offset="16307618">You assure that eventually the interest of all parties in this area was going to lead to this type of agreement but he wasn't sure that this would be possible by the time this project got on the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="4091.312" offset="16365192">Everybody agreed, however, that it was coming and not only because it was feasible but because it was in the long range interest not only of the Government and its dams below but in the long range interest of every system operating in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4113.015" offset="16452023">Now, if this had been the state of facts as of the time the Commission reached its decision, you would have very serious problem of exactly the type that the Government purports to bring before you as to whether the larger amount of coordination, a more detailed coordination which everybody admitted was necessary to get the full benefits of this dam and all the other dams on the system could be achieved through a licensing condition in the license which ordered Pacific Northwest to fully coordinate with the other projects in this area in order to maximize power production.</text>
            <text syncTime="4163.881" offset="16655464">If this had been the case the situation we would find ourselves in today would be very different.</text>

            <text syncTime="4174.287" offset="16697051">And this I think is very important because the optimist of Pacific Northwest prove to be less than full optimist in this case as a result of what may be fortuitous circumstance but as a result of an agreement between the United States and Canada for further development of this river basin in Canada and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4204.016" offset="16815961">As a re -- a factor came along which with the catalytic agent and brought these parties together probably several years earlier than it otherwise would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.131" offset="16868519">The reason for this was that the Canadians refuse to sign the treaty unless the United States entities would agree to take additional power which they couldn't use initially and the United States entities neither the federal one nor the private one could do it themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="4232.091" offset="16928287">They forced themselves to get together and one of the very important by place of this was they reached the Coordination Agreement which the testimony in this evidence said would produce, would produce the full coordination of all of the projects on this river which was necessary both to increase the power supply at these downstream dams and to increase the power at this dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.191" offset="17056705">Now, this forced Coordination Agreement had been signed by the time the examiner reached this -- decided the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4346.735" offset="17386893">Bonneville Administration says that under the Coordination Agreement the various, I'm reading from the report issued by the Bonneville Administration in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="4356.970" offset="17427853">This is what they say about this agreement and as they say -- this is what they say about how things are operating in this area at the present moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4365.743" offset="17462962">They say under the Coordination Agreement, the various public and private utilities and the Federal Government agree to operate there projects much as if all were owned by a single entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4382.345" offset="17529313">For example, water releases from storage projects which this of course is far excellent are carefully timed so they will produce the maximum power at all downstream dams through which they flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="4399.131" offset="17596500">Thus, the owner of an upstream reservoir who might otherwise release stored water to produce power to meet it's own loads by the time when the owner of the downstream dams could not use additional power, water, I'm sorry, agrees to hold his storage for later releases at such time as it will produce the most power on an overall basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4424.463" offset="17697750">In the meantime, the owner of the upstream reservoir is supplied power from a downstream dam which has a surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.252" offset="17756996">On -- in other words, on what we certainly would have agreed was the most critical issue relevant not only to comprehensive development but as to whether it couldn't be done better by the Federal Government and what the testimony of the parties here themselves recognized was the most serious issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4460.303" offset="17841110">The facts are that the dam is going to be operated pursuant to this agreement, present agreement which I have been lodged by, lodged with this Court by the Secretary which I've given you additional copies of which I must apologize for its great complexity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4481.618" offset="17926374">This present agreement to 2003 and under this agreement the practical effect of the thing is that it doesn't matter who owns this dam, whether it is owned by the Bureau of Reclamation or whether it's owned by Pacific Northwest, it's going to be operated in exactly the same way because it's going to be operated under this agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="4993.051" offset="19972180">Let me say that the Coordination Agreement has been alleged to be incomplete because it doesn't provide for hourly water releases to meet the hourly swings of the downstream dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="5007.816" offset="20031216">Now, this is just a misunderstanding of how coordination offers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5012.420" offset="20049607">Water travels at approximately five miles an hour and these dams are a lot further apart than they show on this map and you cannot get coordination by opening and closing this loose gates minute by minute or hour by hour basis and expect water is going to be downstream on time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5034.970" offset="20139781">What you do is you plan in advance under this agreement so that there will be sufficient bondage below -- above all of these dams so that they can take care of their expected swings within a period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5053.588" offset="20214282">Now, my time is running out and I just want to say one final thing about the point raised by Justice White a little earlier and that is about the relevance of the fact that the Secretary here was not recommending federal development, was recommending that there'd be a deferral of this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5075.164" offset="20300591">It is untrue to say that the Commission's decision is based on that and that this was the only reason that the Commission voted against federal development.</text>
            <text syncTime="5084.091" offset="20336327">When you read the Commission decision, it is perfectly clear that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5089.157" offset="20356598">The Commission did say Justice White and Justice Black that the Secretary's disinclination to build the dam which the Commission felt was necessary and which he now recognizes as necessary was an additional factor to be considered in determining whether or not to make a federal -- a recommendation for federal development.</text>
            <text syncTime="5112.430" offset="20449698">And of course this isn't a very surprising position because this was exactly what this Court has held in the case of Chapman versus the FPC 345 U.S. at 153.</text>
            <text syncTime="5129.006" offset="20515944">It is relevant to the question of whether there should be federal development that the Secretary of Interior who in this case is the federal agency who would build any federal development was not interested in building it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5146.264" offset="20585012">Whatever the difficulties are in getting federal development when there are private or public groups other than the Federal Government willing to perform the job and willing to do a comprehensive job, whatever those difficulties are.</text>
            <text syncTime="5163.728" offset="20654811">I need not point out that the last vast made more difficult for the Secretary himself has no interest in immediate development.</text>
            <text syncTime="5175.201" offset="20700787">Let me conclude why -- what I said at the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="5184.902" offset="20739553">Arguments I'm sure can be made, have been made in the past and will be made for many years to come that any major hydroelectric project of this nature should as a matter of philosophy be built by the Federal Government rather than under licensed by a Commission licensee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5206.594" offset="20826279">This is not a matter of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5208.676" offset="20834638">This is not something that if you reopen the case and we listen to people discuss that philosophy is going to advance the ball.</text>
            <text syncTime="5216.638" offset="20866508">It certainly not something which the Commission was required to make a federal recommendation because a policy question is one for Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5227.542" offset="20910080">The statutory scheme of the Act is based upon a Congress conception that comprehensive development including multipurpose dams of this nature can be achieved by licensing under the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5250.823" offset="21003285">And of course one of the main reasons that can be done -- done is everybody realizes that when you have a dam like this which is such a valuable dam which is approximately according to the record $4 million a year cheaper than the ultimate source of power that they could get, that it is to the interest of private people to do a comprehensive job.</text>

            <label>Mr. Hugh Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="5288.865" offset="21155422">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5296.769" offset="21186978">Mr. Solomon has struck to at some length about the nature and condition of the record in this case, I'd like to continue it with just one further point of consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5309.974" offset="21239850">The Secretary said in his brief that it's part of the burden of proof of an applicant to acquire a license under the Federal Power Act that the applicant demonstrate that he will produce as good a dam as the federal -- good a project as the federal project would be that there would be no advantages of federal development one of the several phraseologies of this that the Secretary has used in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5337.072" offset="21348206">I'd like to just briefly discuss with you the problem that is presented to an applicant that was presented to me in preparing and presenting this case to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5347.163" offset="21388643">We were perfectly well aware of Section 7 (b) as Mr. Solomon told you, we just finished the case in which that was the major argument against issuing us a license, we thought to have lost it on another ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="5360.365" offset="21441411">And we -- we had made the case at that time relevant to the problems of why you should have a private project instead of a public private and we prepared this case because we thought we had the same argument all over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="5373.163" offset="21492611">Again, we're wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="5373.914" offset="21495641">It turned out to be a different argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5376.208" offset="21504731">But our evidence was prepared with the idea in mind that we had to satisfy all of the provisions of the Federal Power Act as Mr. Solomon said we don't have a label on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5388.100" offset="21552379">We don't any place say now we are testifying the 7 (b) here, now, were testifying Section 10 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="5395.342" offset="21581322">But certainly we knew this and knowing this the evidence that as an applicant we put in to something like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5404.682" offset="21618625">We produced evidence, this is engineering testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="5407.617" offset="21630433">Its highly technical testimony was produced through a -- a witness on our part was an acknowledged expert in this field that project was designed in such a manner that it was capable of producing not at site but in the area as a whole, in the whole Columbia River Basin, the maximum amount of usable power over the life of the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="5435.912" offset="21743595">Now, this apparently is conceded by the Secretary that we have designed such project because the Secretary says that they will build substantially the same project as we would propose to build if they got the recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5449.586" offset="21798243">Now, we knew we've been in the power business for a long, long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5452.878" offset="21811409">We've helped set up the Northwest Power Pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="5455.346" offset="21821336">We were engaged in the negotiations for the Coordination Agreement while we were before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5460.665" offset="21842651">We knew that we couldn't get that maximum amount in the area as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="5464.988" offset="21859892">This is what we're calling coordination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5467.486" offset="21869923">Unless we got agreement from other parties, so we also introduced evidence, well let me first say that in our license application itself, we stated, that we had designed the project for full coordination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5482.022" offset="21928020">And we stated furthermore in the application itself that we propose to operate that project in full coordination so as to get the maximum amount of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5491.624" offset="21966472">We, therefore, went as far as that stage as we could to commit to ourselves to the operations of this project in the proper manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5498.904" offset="21995520">We produced evidence that we would have to have an agreement in order to have the optimum operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5508.910" offset="22035540">We produced evidence which is in the form of expert opinion evidence I suppose on behalf of our chairman of the board who is the utility executive of some four years experienced that in his judgment the advantages of full coordination would in fact bring the parties in the Northwest, some 15 of them together in an agreement in the life of this project.</text>
            <text syncTime="5535.324" offset="22141283">As Mr. Solomon point out, the opposing applicant was rather less sanguine about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5539.557" offset="22158211">At the beginning of the case or at the end of the case the opposing applicant came right around to our view and as the events demonstrate our judgment was correct and Mr. Solomon pointed out actually it came a little bit further.</text>
            <text syncTime="5552.055" offset="22208157">Now, this is the why in which we show that as far as power is concerned and this includes not one of the difficulties with the Secretary's map which appeared for the first time in its exceptions to examine the opinion is it that it's rather interesting here on the Snake River but at least out of the Columbia River Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="5570.587" offset="22282344">And after all down about here, above the McNary, there's a little stop that goes on with the rest of the Columbia River.</text>
            <text syncTime="5577.897" offset="22311497">And until you get the entire basin in, you cannot start handling the problems that we're talking about in coordination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5586.528" offset="22346083">The differences are rather significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5589.124" offset="22356428">I'll come to this in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5593.970" offset="22375863">But our evidence on coordination was intended to show that there would be coordination not just with these projects but with the entire complex systems throughout the Columbia River Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="5604.982" offset="22419853">And as -- as matters of eventuated this is what we're going to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="5610.577" offset="22442214">No evidence on navigation, well our evidence on flood control which is a little bit more significant was first we designed that project with the necessary facilities reflected through, in terms of facilities this is the question of size of the turbines and the installation low level sluices and various other facilities of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="5630.861" offset="22523402">Those facilities were as a matter of fact those Corps of Engineers wanted this particular project.</text>
            <text syncTime="5636.389" offset="22545554">We said we'd operated for flood control, our power studies reflected operation of this project, the flood control at such time as it was supposed to be operated for flood control.</text>
            <text syncTime="5646.585" offset="22586305">And that was put into the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5648.773" offset="22595082">We put it in as our exhibit because we thought it was so important but it also went in independently.</text>
            <text syncTime="5653.834" offset="22615249">The formal statement of the Chief of the Corps of Engineers that he had examined our plans and that he was satisfied that this project under license to us would provide the same flood control as would a project designed and built by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5670.216" offset="22680764">Now, that's part of the record evidence on which the Commission is acting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5673.695" offset="22694766">Substantially, the same thing is said about navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5676.712" offset="22706782">And actually navigation in this particular project is practically de minimis, it's a negative benefit you -- you -- until the downstream dam of China Gardens is built that maintain the minimum flows in the river not so as not to interfere with navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5692.275" offset="22769058">We don't have navigation benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5694.468" offset="22777835">But still the project has got to be designed to operate in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5697.907" offset="22791628">We did so, we include that in our power studies and the Chief of the Corps of Engineers made exactly the same point as the navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5706.412" offset="22825587">Now, essentially, we have done exactly on every one of these other public purposes, we have done the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5716.612" offset="22866442">On recreation which is a difficult thing to -- to -- you can't get this down in the engineering terms like you do on these others.</text>
            <text syncTime="5724.880" offset="22899461">On recreation what we have done is adopt then, I think, improve on the plans of the forest service which is the agency that has control practically all of the Government land for all practical purposes of the whole reservoir because most of the reservoir area is Government land.</text>
            <text syncTime="5742.392" offset="22969469">We have -- we have followed those plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="5744.409" offset="22977620">We, as I say, I think we've improved on them somewhat.</text>
            <text syncTime="5747.606" offset="22990367">On fish, good heavens, this was one of the major questions before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5752.373" offset="23009489">There was evidence not only by us but by everybody as to what had to be done about fish, what the problems were, how they were best handled.Our contribution there was a rather unique solution, problem of the Imnaha River which put rather briefly and therefore somewhat inaccurately amounted to constructing in our official channel of the Imnaha that were carried around the dam and deposit that in the Snake River border of the dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="5780.352" offset="23121398">Now, if I can summarize, what we presented was evidence tended to prove that we would produce the project designed and built by us and operated by us would produce the maximum amount of power in the area as a whole, usable power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5801.457" offset="23205825">And that we propose them soon.</text>
            <text syncTime="5804.369" offset="23217424">The evidence introduced tended to show that we would produce exactly the flood control of the federal project would produce, exactly the navigation benefits of the federal project would produce, that would we -- we would do as well if not better for fish and the Federal Government would do.</text>

            <text syncTime="5885.985" offset="23543850">The river problem is that the major reservoir creates an ecological condition and that the fish don't know what to do with going in either direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5893.764" offset="23574988">So you have to keep them out of the reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="5895.670" offset="23582616">Now, we keep the adults out by diverting them into this channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5899.519" offset="23597976">The fray coming down are rather easy to handle because they're small and we install what is known as revolving fish stream which is a fairly conventional piece of machinery at the headwater of the reservoir on the Imnaha River and that diverts the fish in -- back into the channel.</text>

            <text syncTime="6581.662" offset="26326622">That was the best that can be done if you have a license that's going to run 50 years, you have to provide certain more or less inflexible conditions in the license hoping that it will take care of the circumstances.</text>
