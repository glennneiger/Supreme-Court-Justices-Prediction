            <label>Mr. Paul A. Porter</label>
            <text syncTime="39.398" offset="260995">This case is here on certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to review the holding of the District Court that without jurisdiction by reason of the Norris-La Guardia Act to issue an injunction against the picketing which suddenly surrounded of the Jacksonville terminal and effectively prevented all rail access through those facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.444" offset="365171">Now, the facts about the turmoil and the picketing, we think are essential for a proper understanding of this case and I will undertake that task.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.632" offset="405922">Mr. Lyons will then address himself to some of the underlying legal issues that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.241" offset="432358">The Jacksonville terminal, if Your Honor please, is shown in green here on this map.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.581" offset="461720">Now, this represents a -- an expanded version of the map which is on page 9 of our opening brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.538" offset="497560">Now, there's a basic concept with respect to these terminals that we believe is important to comprehend and that is this terminal is not a place by traffic stops, it is not a place where traffic terminates.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.111" offset="559835">Brotherhoods most important function is its ways through which traffic moves and the terminal maybe a more appropriately described we think as a gateway or a thrown of commerce to which all the rail traffic to the entire commissioner Florida flows.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.163" offset="639979">Now, the terminal stands upward as you will see of the main lines of the principle carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.586" offset="669759">Here, shown on this map, there's the main line of the Atlantic Coast Line which is in blue and it runs down from the north of Richmond, Virginia onto Tampa and points south of -- in to mention to Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.003" offset="751365">Its main lines enter here at the McQuade Street and exit next to Jonas Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.071" offset="783653">That is marked here.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.690" offset="794102">If you cut off the terminal property where these main lines run through thus you cut off the main line of the Atlantic Coast Line.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.554" offset="829628">Here's also the principal main line of the seaboard and this is designated here in Orange.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.832" offset="858676">As you can see the seaboard, enters into the terminal here on Paton Street and exits on Stockton Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.064" offset="891591">So, certainly if you cut off the terminal, you cut off the main line of the seaboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.187" offset="920116">Now, in addition this main line control operations that move on the coastline and seaboard which do not involved interchanges between any carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.115" offset="959822">The terminal was are placed through which there is a considerable interchange of freight traffic between carriers of plants coal through the terminal properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.670" offset="998066">Now, these interchanges of course are necessary to move commodities to Florida or necessary for the vast and space effort and therefore, it orders from the Seaboard and the Coastline to interchange their freight with each other, these cars has must be moved into and through the terminal property and say it was a keys of the southern railway system which lies in within the terminal here and are shown in red.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.586" offset="1105690">The same is true on the struck Florida East Coast Carrier whose lands are shown in brown and they come up from the south and terminate across the St. John's River at river side out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.360" offset="1156786">That is the northernmost terminal of the Florida East Coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.652" offset="1174026">It moves on traffic --</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="268.548" offset="1177579">Is there another carrier designed to realign the (Inaudible)?</text>

          <turn speaker="paul_a_porter" startTime="271.947" stopTime="278.957">
            <label>Mr. Paul A. Porter</label>
            <text syncTime="271.947" offset="1191163">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.178" offset="1192103">Another carrier and the -- or there's the Atlantic Coast Line, the Seaboard, the Southern and the FEC.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="278.957" offset="1219166">The Southern and --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_a_porter" startTime="279.781" stopTime="544.728">
            <label>Mr. Paul A. Porter</label>
            <text syncTime="279.781" offset="1222510">And the Southern, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.547" offset="1229511">Now, as I have said, the FEC has no through moves through this terminal and even when you consider the interchange that is involved on the main lines of the Coastline and the Seaboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.626" offset="1285831">They do not involve interchanges with the FEC plus about 70% of all the freight interchanges involved carriers other than the struck FEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.914" offset="1342986">That is the Coastline, the Seaboard and the Southern.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.853" offset="1354794">And I think that another relevant measure is the fact that the coastline for example generates about a $100 million in freight revenues to and from the Peninsula, Florida and only about $3 million of his revenues are accounted for with the interchanges with the FEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.251" offset="1424384">Now, of course there are host of other activities are performed in the terminal facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.143" offset="1443924">This is where all U.S. mail flowing into and out of Peninsula, Florida is handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.843" offset="1466702">About 95% of the entire mail volume in fact passes through the Jacksonville terminal and the FEC handles no mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.865" offset="1510797">So, you cut off the terminal and you stop the flow of U.S. mail into Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.660" offset="1533994">Now, on local level, the terminal serves are number of industries through its own facilities as well as the industries that are located around the various yards and near the terminal properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.005" offset="1591359">The terminal company I should add is a regulated common carrier in its own right.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.298" offset="1616541">Now, these industries which are served by the terminal properties cut off the terminal facilities, rail service to those industries is plus terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.207" offset="1660217">One quick example perhaps would be useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.355" offset="1672756">There is up in the northeast direction here from the terminal, a large paper mill that receives about 3,000 cars per month on raw material and ships out about a thousand cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.415" offset="1729076">It was pointed out at the trial court that it would shutdown within a few days after rail service was discontinued thus eliminating about 1600 jobs in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.759" offset="1786441">Now, the terminal is also an important place for having passenger service.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.463" offset="1801174">As a matter of fact, the only passenger terminal in North East Florida is located in the terminal premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.566" offset="1829595">The Seaboard and Coastline moved 42 frames per day through the terminal facilities whereas the Florida East Coast has only one train each day which operates only on weekdays, one train each way I should say.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.797" offset="1894588">Now in addition to the internal yards in the terminal property here, in the Y.H. and the Honeymoon Yards, each of the carriers using the terminal as its own yard outside the boundaries of terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.092" offset="1947773">For example, Coast Line Mount free yard is marked there and the seaboard as this yard the West Jacksonville yard here to the west.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.328" offset="1996675">Whereas I think this is some of significant if the Court please, the FEC as this yard known as the bottom yard across the St. John's River and 12 miles distance from the terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.938" offset="2059160">The southern has this yard up near the Mount free yard known as the Simpson yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.745" offset="2078386">Now, in order for freight movements, one carrier to be interchanged with another, the delivering carrier brings his cars and his own crews to a pre-assigned point either within the terminal or by means of a movement through the terminal to a point in the yards of the other carriers and leaves the cars off at this pre-arranged point then receiving carrier with these groups picks up the cars and begins the process of taking them for their -- to their destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.416" offset="2197086">Now, in order for the FEC to interchange his crew has bring them from their Dalton yards 12 miles south of the St. John's River across the terminal entering here and then at the terminal property of southern, pick them up, take them and distribute them to the pre-arranged yards and there they're cut in to a through movement.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="544.728" offset="2282245">What's the total area of the terminal?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_a_porter" startTime="547.084" stopTime="682.558">
            <label>Mr. Paul A. Porter</label>
            <text syncTime="547.084" offset="2291754">The -- the total area of the terminal Mr. Justice Harlan, I believe at this green area here is an area of I think three-and-a-half square miles and it includes a division to the passengers stations, the mail ships, mail service, railway express is also located there handling about two-and-a-half million packages per month.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.224" offset="2396244">So, the perimeter of this terminal is -- I may have overstated it but it is the orange facility of perhaps that magnitude and the terminal of these other properties whose rights of way as I have said is the regulated interstate carrier in his own right.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.723" offset="2462281">I think this Court is familiar because the case that was here the last term, the history of strikes that the Florida East Coast have been involved for the past three-and-a-half years.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.787" offset="2506480">The non-operating Brotherhoods have been on strike since 1963 but the FEC has operated in spite of that strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.512" offset="2541380">Now, after FEC sought to put in a number of rule changes affecting the operating Brotherhoods, those Brotherhoods after the exhaustion of procedures specified in the Railway Labor Act went on strike against the FEC in April of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.062" offset="2603656">And the early morning hours of May 4 of this year, without advance notice or warning, the operating Brotherhoods through a picket line along the terminal of the properties and these numbers here show the location and the numbers of the pickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.395" offset="2680978">Lots of pickets were placed here at the Akron Street crossing where the mainline of the seaboard crosses through the terminal and the Church Street crossing where seaboards, cars were having destined for terminal handling also entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.721" offset="2754226">And similarly of pickets were stationed at the Jonas Street and the McQuade Street crossing and that is where the Atlantic Coast Line mainlines enter and exit from the terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.098" offset="2799783">There are also station around strategically as you can see and a number of rail and food entrances used by the terminal company and their own employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="716.263" offset="2968430">But the picketing of the terminal at the early morning hours of May 4 caused a complete secession of all activity in the terminal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1019.468" offset="4181243">Now, for reason which Mr. Lyons will develop further, it is our position that the decision of the District Court was correct and the inability or the unwillingness or even stubbornness of the FEC to settle this long standing dispute with the Brotherhoods cannot and should not, we submit, be permitted to broaden the area of strike and shutdown carriers who have peaceful relationships with their own employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.217" offset="4304227">If you will, what the Brotherhoods barely seeking to apply here is a principle of escalation in railway affairs which if carried out logically, we submit could paralyze the rail transportation of this country even beyond the boundaries of the potential of Florida for we cannot even realistically conclude that even if the FEC employees were able to shutdown transportation on a broad regional or statewide basis that such a calamity would result in setting their differences with the apparently intractable Florida East Coast Railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.104" offset="4459813">We submit that a management which is exhibited and approached to his employees such of the FEC could scarcely be expected to habituate even if the whole commerce of the nation was brought to a granting halt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.456" offset="4513207">Thus, the consequences of making innocent carriers and the public suffer for what might be called the 19th century attitude of a recalls of the carrier is really awesome when you consider the terms and the impact upon the nation's transportation system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.851" offset="4586768">Now, preventing the closing down of the Jacksonville terminal because of a dispute out the brotherhoods, what in our view reduce labor railway relationships to the loss common denominator, it would vastly enlarge the effects of a railway labor dispute rather than containing or confining it as we insist national policy requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.507" offset="4677360">The picketing of the Jacksonville terminal in our view amounts to a direct use of unlawful economic weapons by the railway Brotherhoods to carriers who are not a party to their dispute and unless the District Court has jurisdiction to limit the picketing which threaten the complete shutdown of all rail transportation to potential of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.444" offset="4773177">Neutral carriers under innocent third parties and the public are threaten with irreparable injury for which no remedy would be available.</text>

            <text syncTime="1192.031" offset="4871502">Thus, mail express in fact, that all the commerce going to potential of Florida must use of necessity these terminal facilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2098.156" offset="8496044">For one thing there was testimony in the record that if the very day that mail facility at the terminal was shutdown and it would take six days to catch up and that was the testimony that was given in the light of the Monday closing and the -- it would not be long before the industrial users in Duval County would be cut off and before the effects of the strike beyond if they felt throughout all the peninsular Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.207" offset="8616208">This is the main line of the Atlantic Coast Line that goes through these premises that is one main carriers that serves between this part of the country and in Florida has also a principle line of the seaboard that was closed down by this picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.612" offset="8693844">And the -- and neither the facts of these were quite clear indication of what the effects would have been if the striking or picketing if the picketing went on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.830" offset="8746715">The -- to make a first case that this Court decided back in 1960, we think those are clear indication of the way the Norris-LaGuardia Act is meant to operate in the railway labor field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.109" offset="8819858">The way it operates is that when two parties are locked in a major dispute something for which the Act provides procedures but Norris-LaGuardia Act tells them that down at the end of the road that they're traveling the road of negotiation and mediation if they can settle that dispute through those processes that the law is going to leave them free to use economic warfare against each other and that should be a powerful incentive to both of them to bargain in good faith and to attempt to reach the solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.319" offset="8960606">Now, here we have something that essentially the Railway Labor Act doesn't give any of these mediatory or conciliatory procedures too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.907" offset="8998954">We have an interruption to commerce that doesn't come into play at the end of a long road of bargaining and mediation and perhaps presidential board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.887" offset="9050885">We had here an interruption interstate commerce that started without warning at 3'0 clock in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.981" offset="9079306">Now, the basic answer as I understand it of the respondents to this, is that they have a dispute with the FEC that they and the FEC have exhausted the procedures that the Act provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.415" offset="9145031">And that therefore they are free to use self help but from that proposition they slide into the further proposition that they are free to use self help upon other carriers, not simply self help that is aimed directly at the FEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.671" offset="9214098">Now, that is -- there's an attempt to cross over that by the proposition that in strike a lot of innocent people get hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.820" offset="9242624">Well, the reason why innocent people get hurt in the strike is it's the result of the direct pressures that one party puts on another people if the strike were successful against the FEC people who were dependent on the FEC for services might suffer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.249" offset="9300407">But the suffering in the turn of the economic screw that's going on here is one that's being aimed directly at the coastline and in the seaboard and the terminal company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.880" offset="9342934">And what the Brotherhoods are saying to those carriers is, that unless you embargo the FEC, unless you stop doing business with them you'll not move any cars through the Jacksonville terminal as far as the coastline is concern they're really saying that the bottom half of their system, the rail system was going to be knocked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.133" offset="9427884">To the seaboard they are saying that an important part of your system going through Duval County is going to be knocked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.446" offset="9457142">It's rather a strange paradox to say that in order for the operations of these carriers to be closed down because of a dispute that they have with their own employees that there would have to be these procedures mediation and negotiation of the presidential -- board of the president which so disposed that these procedures which would take years certainly many, many months and which would tend as far as we're practical tend to bring them together but you'd have to go through that if you had a controversy with your own employees yet someone else has a controversy some other rail car has a controversy with his employees that you can be closed down without any of these procedures that you can be closed down 3 o'clock in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.015" offset="9663404">The ultimate test of the -- what I would say primarily to that is the -- further that there's more wrong with that and in fact that it simply paradoxical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.094" offset="9711783">The basic fact is that the coastline, the seaboard and the terminal company have never had any of the benefit of these procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.766" offset="9742399">The mediation that takes place between the Florida East Coast and Unions is not a matter to which the carriers that are concerned here are parties to which they could become parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.657" offset="9790046">They maybe disposed to have good employee relations with their employees and indeed the record shows that they have but that altitude doesn't do them a bit of good in a controversy of this sort.</text>

            <text syncTime="2988.480" offset="12057266">But there is regional bargaining and that is a pattern that has developed but subsequent the passage of the Railway Labor Act in 1926, the Norris-LaGuardia Act in 1932 and the amendments to the Railway Labor Act in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.932" offset="12115048">So, this pattern of industry-wide bargaining was not an established pattern when these statutes were passed by Congress and Congress we respectfully submit did not pass these acts with that idea in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.867" offset="12162800">Now, it is true that Congress recognized as we submit is very obvious that an interruption of commerce on any class one railroad is going to have effects on other class one railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.911" offset="12210970">This Court in the case of California v. Taylor which concerned a state owned by California Terminal Company and the California State Law absolutely forbid the employees of that state owned railroad as state employees to strike and the question was whether or not the Railway Labor Act applied to that terminal company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.965" offset="12299264">And this Court held that it did that the federal law superseded the state law even thought the federal law guaranteed in certain circumstances the right to self help and to take strike action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.636" offset="12349942">And Mr. Justice Minton in the course of that opinion expressly stated that it -- that it's obvious and the Congress knew it and that this Court was well aware of the fact that when a terminal company is faced with a strike or when it's involved in a strike it's going to have area-wide effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.095" offset="12427786">Now, we submit that the fact that this particular kind of situation has not been before the Court in a railroad context before is eloquent testimony to the effectiveness of the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.572" offset="12477628">This is the longest strike, this is the first rail major breakdown since 1926 in the functioning to the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.750" offset="12510333">You had a strike in the RLN that ran for about 60-70 days after that sort you had the Toledo case back during the war, that also with the primarily a terminal type railroad that ran for quite of period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.811" offset="12574595">But with those very rare exceptions, the Railway Labor Act has worked and it has worked effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.638" offset="12609912">Now, the problem that we're faced here is where for one reason or another, parties are totally unable to get together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.714" offset="12646275">Now, we submit as the record shows that breakdown in collective bargaining here lies on negative side.</text>

            <text syncTime="3170.011" offset="12783365">And that it involves it and it arises out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.446" offset="12801128">The FEC when before going into this, I would like to make extremely clear that this is not the same strike that was before this Court last spring in the Clerk's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.050" offset="12851597">That was the non-operating union strike that is going on since 1963 and is still going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.498" offset="12873331">This is the operating Brotherhoods, non-operating people of course referred to Clerk's like for these people that worked in the railroad industry but don't actually operate trains, the operating crafts or people like engineers and trainmen and switchmen who actually run the train.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.865" offset="12938846">And the operating strike did not begin until April 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.298" offset="12956609">The reason it began at that time was because that was the 30-day-period after the National Mediation Board released the parties to self help and the FEC as of midnight, April 24th implemented on a wholesale basis, it's Section 6 proposals and actually the Brotherhoods here involved took strike action in response.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.800" offset="13086595">However, going to facts two, and I think this is background material which is very irrelevant to the situation before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.585" offset="13117733">Going back to 1963 when the none of strikes first began, what happened was the FEC shutdown completely as the airlines did this summer during the machinist strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.502" offset="13169351">They didn't try to operate for period of days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.012" offset="13183457">And they pursuant to the association of American Railroad Rules and that have been adopted by Interstate Commerce Commission apparently the FEC embargo all the traffic with its connecting carriers and we're not going to take it, we're not going to send it, we're not going to take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.679" offset="13258062">We've -- we have an embargo because we have labor trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.050" offset="13271542">And as a result all traffic stopped here at the beginning of the premises and there was no question at that point of any picketing, spreading around the green area, the Jacksonville Terminal Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.713" offset="13342177">The FEC then apparently made its determination that it was going to commence operations despite the strike and it went into Court and brought a lawsuit against the terminal company and the other connecting carriers and stated the analogy I thought was very apt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.294" offset="13412498">They said, where FEC said, we're like a bachelor in an apartment shared by five bachelors and we're sick and they are trying to throw us out because we're sick and we don't -- we think we have the right to a court and a right to remain here so that we can get well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.120" offset="13491806">What they wanted was safe harbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.849" offset="13502777">They wanted to use of this terminal free from the effects of the primary picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.795" offset="13526601">They did not make the unions party that proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.147" offset="13536005">The unions tried to intervene later, they refuse intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.300" offset="13552619">The result of that proceeding which is still at this very time still at the temporary injunction sanction is that the Court order the terminal company of these other carriers to provide various services to the FEC, to provide direct labor services to the FEC, to interchange cars with the FEC, to make deliveries to the FEC, to take deliveries from the FEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.513" offset="13649377">In short, this was the place where the FEC not only did business with the public this is the place where the FEC does business with its connecting carrier by contract that it setup, it obligated itself to do business that these other carriers at this place --</text>

            <text syncTime="4410.472" offset="17745272">Now, I would like to move on into the question of the application of Norris-LaGuardia to this conduct whether you call it secondary or primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4426.840" offset="17810683">We submit that the history which is familiar to this Court certainly leading up to the passage of Norris-LaGuardia shows very clearly that Norris-LaGuardia was very deliberately designed to apply to situations which would be called secondary under the National Labor Relations Act definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.645" offset="17897932">The -- the Clayton Act of course was passed in 1914, Section 20 of that purported to make lawful that is to make not in violation of any law of United States certain described kinds of consorted conduct and the Clayton Act at that time was passed in the setting of three railroad labor cases which involve interchange such as this, there was the earliest case was a Circuit Court case decided by Circuit Judge Taff, later Chief Justice in the Toledo case and back in 19 -- 1893 in which he require employees about connecting carrier to make interchange with these struck carrier and of course there was the debts injunction in 1894 affirmed in 1895 where there was clearly secondary boycott and that Mr. Davis at the Chicago Terminal was trying to like consorted action stopped trains that had Pullman cars in it that were simply pulling Pullman cars, remote from the scene of the actual primary dispute and there was the ex parte Lennon case cited by the parties, cited in 1897 where an engineer was held and contempt in jail for violating an injunction compelling a connecting carrier with a struck carrier to interchange cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="4538.997" offset="18259362">And the Clayton Act was passed in the back of those cases and said out described type of consorted activity and as Mr. Justice frankfurter described it added the catch all phrase that those consorted activities would not be a violation of any law of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4558.937" offset="18339088">Those earlier cases the Debbs and the Lennon and the Toledo case were all decided on the basis that the conduct enjoin there was a violation of the Interstate Commerce Act or the mail statute or of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4575.417" offset="18405021">And the Clayton Act of course by that catch all phrase remove the basis of those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4583.462" offset="18437204">The -- what happened after that of course is familiar in the duplex case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4588.402" offset="18456952">You had clearly secondary type activity, you had a manufacturer at Michigan making printing press and you had picketing in New York against people who had bought those printing press we're using in the clearest type of secondary activity under a before the majority of this Court held that that was not covered by the Clayton Act that could be enjoin as a violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4611.933" offset="18551097">The dissenters Justice Brandeis, Justice Holmes, Justice Clark held that this was a misreading of the Clayton Act, a misconstruction of it and of course in 1932 in the Norris-LaGuardia Act we submit that Congress that adopted the views of the dissenters in the Duplex case as this Court as itself so ruled in case of the Milkwagon drivers case versus lake farm cited in our brief and United States the Hudson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4644.365" offset="18680874">Now, the fact that the legislative history of Norris-LaGuardia on this point is unusually clear because as described by Senator Norris in his book.</text>
            <text syncTime="4660.461" offset="18745240">The Act, the Norris-LaGuardia Act was an off spring of the old ships that Act and the outside help was called in and the -- of course the book, the written by Justice Frankfurter and professor Green, the labor injunction that was published in 1932 and was backgrounds of the Norris-LaGuardia Act and it has in the appendix of that book is that draft to the bill not as finally passed but substantially as finally passed in -- there's a considerable discussion of it and in that book, it's quite clear that the commentary at that time when the act was being formed that they contemplated secondary that the Norris-LaGuardia Act would apply to secondary activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4717.747" offset="18974386">The --Justice Frankfurter refers to the line of New York decision which referred to a unity of interest and he discusses a great length in the book where you draw the line and where that act, it was the line was within the same industry that if you were within the same industry that neutrals made the appeal to the New York line of cases is described in that book as follows and I just like read one sentence from it, in New York if justification for economic pressure has found legal recognitions a strike or a threat to strike maybe brought to bear upon neutrals provided that the neutrals does use is a lever are with in the same industry as goes and who's coercion is union is primarily interest and it was that New York rule which is referred is being embodies with in the Norris-LaGuardia Act and we submit that the definitional of the literal application is Chief Judge Toddles stated in his opinion below if you look just to the language of Norris-LaGuardia it applies to this situation and clearly applies regardless of whether you call this common side is picketing primary or secondary.</text>

            <text syncTime="4802.926" offset="19315127">That's correct Your Honor and I would like to move on under that of this Court of course has held that the later passed Railway Labor Act in the sense that it was extensively amended in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="4819.767" offset="19382418">Thus, must be accommodated as a fellow or a companion labor statute with the Norris-LaGuardia Act where the need is obviously apparent where it is a need that cannot be denied because if you applied Norris-LaGuardia the explicit provisions of the Railway Labor Act could not be operative.</text>
            <text syncTime="4841.762" offset="19470399">Now, there are two places, two situations where that occur; one of course is the minor dispute situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4848.066" offset="19495685">If you have compulsory arbitration of minor disputes obviously that would be totally frustration if you also permitted strikes over minor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4863.553" offset="19557543">In other words, there is a square opposition there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.474" offset="19569246">That is one place, the other place is where you have a major dispute that hasn't been refined through the mandatory procedures of the Act where you attempt to exert economic pressure without going through bargaining and mediation and the tender anyway of voluntary arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4887.538" offset="19653569">In those two instance, in those two instance only we submit the procedures of the Railway Labor Act for which have worked so successfully would be totally frustrated unless the prohibitions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act were eliminated in those specific situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.634" offset="19737893">But we have here of course the major dispute which has gone through the procedures, there is no provision of the Railway Labor Act that has been pointed to in any stage of this litigation that we have been in violation of it that the picket words have been in violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4925.736" offset="19806333">Now, they say they that we should observe Section 6 notes on the terminal company but we don't represent the terminal company employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4934.114" offset="19839875">The BRT does represent some terminal company employees but conductors don't and the firemen don't and not only that the employees for instance who moved these switches for FEC train movement were not represented by BRT.</text>

            <text syncTime="4999.757" offset="20102353">Now, again our dispute, our major dispute of course with the FEC you can say that we have a dispute with the terminal company in the sense that terminal company employees are performing day to day labor services for the benefit of the FEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="5015.826" offset="20166719">We are appealing to those employs not to do that but that's a collateral dispute that arises out obvious if the major dispute with the FEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="5026.770" offset="20210500">But for the major dispute with the FEC this entire problem would not leave before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5037.380" offset="20252923">The suggestion which perhaps to be derive from the part of the legislative history of Norris-LaGuardia referred to the colliquy between Congressman LaGuardia and another congressman about the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5052.304" offset="20312586">We submit is not decisive here in any sense this Court of course has twice squarely held the Norris-LaGuardia Act applicable in a railroad situation where all of the procedures of the Act had been exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5068.444" offset="20377161">One of course was the Lega First case in 1960 against the Chicago in Northwestern Railroad Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.192" offset="20408090">The other case was the earlier 1944 case Trainmen against the Toledo and the Diorio railroad and of course there was during the course of Norris-LaGuardia a specific amendment submitted to Congress specifically exempting the railway industry from Norris-LaGuardia.</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.804" offset="20486562">This was voted down and was voted down.</text>
            <text syncTime="5099.160" offset="20500041">Now, in summary we submit first of all that on a factual basis this is in the tradition and history of the labor movement primary conduct at the very most it is common situs which may or may not be called secondary depending on where you should draw the secondary line that this is the very type of conduct which Norris-LaGuardia does cover was designed to cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="5127.411" offset="20612995">This Court has so held in the Milkwagon driver's case and the Hudson case, in the Wagshow case and Marinecooks and Stewards repeatedly situations each of those involving what would be called secondary activity under it before today, Milkwagon, Hudson, Wagshow and Marinecooks each involving secondary activity, each Norris-LaGuardia being applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="5151.394" offset="20708916">And finally, we say that there is no specific provision of requirement in the Railway Labor Act itself, search the man which even suggests that there must be in accommodation between these two labor statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="5740.638" offset="23065893">I'd like to turn our attention for a moment to a rather fully separable jurisdictional failure of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5749.947" offset="23103195">If there is any legislation of the Congress of the United States which does regulate secondary conduct certainly the Railway Labor Act does not itself in terms regulate secondary conduct if there is any such regulation, it is the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5768.305" offset="23176547">Now, there is a question and we say it is that the conduct of the respondents here is arguably subject to the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5783.607" offset="23237778">The conduct is characterized as being secondary activity, it wasn't so characterized in the lower court, it is here characterized as secondary activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5795.237" offset="23284276">Certainly, it is arguably secondary activity under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5803.826" offset="23318653">The real question then is, are we a labor organization and that is the Brotherhood of Railroad Train?</text>
            <text syncTime="5812.470" offset="23353240">The statute says that labor organization may not appeal to employees of any person, a railroad is such a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="5825.044" offset="23403499">Now, we don't think that we are with in the secondary provisions prohibitions of the National Labor Relations Act but we are a labor organization because we represent bus drivers and a labor organization is an organization which represents employees in whole or impart an employees are employees of an employer under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5853.962" offset="23519169">So, we are within a literal language of the act labor organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5859.680" offset="23542053">Now, we wouldn't have thought that this was even arguable except for a recent decision, IDEW versus NLRB and which this Court denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="5872.023" offset="23591476">There, the entire dispute was in the railroad industry, it was the same 11 non-operating organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5879.461" offset="23621256">Two of them who were pure Railway Labor Act organizations picketed and the effort of picketing was cooperative of some organizations that were impart railway labor and impart that partly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5898.246" offset="23696384">But there, they were representing solely railway labor but the holding of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia this Circuit rather was that the railway organizations were labor organizations and therefore subject to these provisions of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5923.351" offset="23796799">Now, this is the same point which is before this Court now in the companion state case because it is a jurisdictional at fundamental jurisdictional matter it is here on prohibition rather than to appeal because we couldn't obviously get it ran it through a state system as that will go through a federal system but we do have it here on prohibition on the same jurisdictional basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="6015.598" offset="24165752">I think it's important to point out that while there have been a number of cases in which the Railway Labor Act has been accommodated to Norris-LaGuardia rather vice versa and that there have been injunctions issued in railway labor matter they have all been to enforce specific duties in the Railway Labor Act and what we say is that here there are no specific duties.</text>

            <text syncTime="6121.067" offset="24587682">It's a rather -- we think a rather Blanton request to this Court to legislate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6125.877" offset="24606908">Now, whenever this -- the issue of secondary versus primary conduct whenever it is come up in the Congress there have been fears, battles and arguments as to what is best for the country and it hasn't always been the same up until 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="6146.470" offset="24689246">We didn't have any federal inhibitions on secondary conduct and even under territorially there is a different rule has been pointed out for the garment industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="6197.274" offset="24892479">All these questions are matters of very primary public policy question which have been left to the Congress quite appropriately because it is a battle of economic forces.</text>

            <text syncTime="6222.534" offset="24993520">Railway labor is tied up much more tightly before it comes to the point of a strike and certainly Congress contemplated that when we got to a strike situation and there's railway labor industry that it would affect not only the struck carrier but other carriers in the duty section, the duty of a railway labor carrier is to prevent a breakdown of mediation so as not to interrupt itself and other carriers.</text>

            <text syncTime="6539.012" offset="26259414">This is the -- as I understand it the second line of defense of the respondents here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6546.703" offset="26290134">Now, what we suggest is properly before the Court on this review of a preliminary injunction like any review of preliminary injunction on appeal is the essential jurisdiction of the District Court and whether the District Court abused its discretion in passing the relief which it passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6567.133" offset="26371950">There will be if there is jurisdiction in this case a further hearing before the District Court on the question of what shape or what form the permanent injunctions to be passed would take.</text>
            <text syncTime="6580.110" offset="26423777">Now, what we have undeniably in this case is interference with an enormous volume of rail traffic that has nothing at all to do with the FEC what the pickets carry on teir signs, the first words of that were “do not cross”, do not cross this picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="6601.229" offset="26508309">They stopped the mainline coastline movement that was coming down from Richmond, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="6607.177" offset="26532028">They stopped it here at this Plaid Street crossing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6611.700" offset="26550209">There were pickets placed at the Acorn Street crossing, it was only function is to carry the seaboard's mainline across the terminal at the Stockton Street crossing which has that function as well as some interchange functions and at the Dennis Street crossing where the only function of the coastline to mainline movements.</text>
            <text syncTime="6633.567" offset="26637667">Now, there's some dispute is to whether the pickets were on the line or whether they were ride along side on dirt road there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6645.753" offset="26686360">If there is any serious question as to about our and as to having a materiality in terms of relief I would think the District Court could resolve and if there is jurisdiction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6659.292" offset="26740590">Of course we don't claim that the picketing here was what's called belly to back picketing or the sort of picketing that physically interrupts commerce what you have here is picketing that induce the petitioner's employees concertedly not to work and not to work at all and indeed counsel for the respondents recognized that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6682.657" offset="26834004">They said that one of the reasons that might someday if there was an injunction lead them to limit the scope of the picketing Ex (Inaudible) or as the matter of their own economic interest was the fact that if the picketing would do a way with a lot of jobs of their own craftsman.</text>
            <text syncTime="6703.588" offset="26917700">Well, the reason why it does a way of a lot of jobs there that because it involves enormous amount of work throughout the terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6713.285" offset="26956466">That is nothing to do with the FEC, they don't want their crafts members to handle FEC cars but they say here, admits that a great bulk of what their crews do has nothing at all to do with the FEC and that's worth that they might let them continue though they wanted to -- they want to be masters of whether they will continue or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="6740.425" offset="27065031">The essential point then in this case is the question of jurisdiction and I believe counsel admitted or came very close to admitting that the jurisdictional question that the Jacksonville terminal is the same jurisdictional question that would surround this if there were picketing over this dispute at atomic yards and Alexander Arena if there were picketing in Richmond, if there were picketing in Chicago, if there were picketing in Saint Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6773.146" offset="27195956">Once we address ourselves to the jurisdictional question, it doesn't matter how secondary or how tertiary or how much further we go.</text>

            <text syncTime="6811.968" offset="27351228">Then, we also further say that on the merits once we got passed the jurisdictional question that the complaint stated the cause of action under the Interstate Commerce Act by way of removing an obstruction to the petitioner's duties under that act and we contend that even though as we've heard many, many times on the respondents that there is no specific provision of the Railway Labor Act that we can point to and said they're flatly broken.</text>

            <text syncTime="6892.252" offset="27672430">Counsel raised in fact that the injunction that broad enough to prohibit the picketing at this point here which is where the FEC's cars come across the river, St. John River on the bridge and enter the terminal property caused a verbal matter it might to that I suspect one of the reasons why there was an exception drafted for that was the fact that the unions never sought to picket there which I believe emphasizes the essentially secondary again nature --</text>

            <text syncTime="6980.640" offset="28025919">They picketed here what you have at the Plaid, the basic activity just goes on to Plaid is the mainline movement of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="6991.823" offset="28070640">But you will see an FEC face at Plaid Street because they do pick up the cars here from the Coast Line.</text>
            <text syncTime="7001.876" offset="28110869">But once again there, the picket signs said, “Do Not Cross” and what happened, the crews did not cross.</text>
            <text syncTime="7012.500" offset="28153396">The mainline trains did not cross and the major activity is that take place at that crossing just like these relatively minor ones that have to do with the FEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="7025.222" offset="28204283">They were brought to a halt as well as the activities having to do with the FEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="7031.649" offset="28229987">Thank you Your Honor.</text>
