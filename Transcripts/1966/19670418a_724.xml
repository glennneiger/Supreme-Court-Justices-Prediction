            <label>Mr. Harry Frazier III</label>
            <text syncTime="38.594" offset="257755">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.218" offset="272280">This is the case involving the City Council of the City of Virginia Beach, Virginia wherein the appellants are the members of the City Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.589" offset="313762">The appellees are voters within the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.208" offset="336227">This case presents three questions, two of which we think can be disposed of promptly so that we may concentrate primarily on the third one.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.797" offset="386591">The first question, and this was put to us by the Court, was whether a three-judge court should have been convened below to hear this case in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.905" offset="443016">The plan of representation with which we are concerned here today applies only to the City of Virginia Beach, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.902" offset="474990">It was adopted by a special Act of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.525" offset="489514">There is none like it in the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.508" offset="505396">The Solicitor General agrees with us that we are properly before the Court because under prior decisions of this Court, a city charter of this nature does not present the matter of statewide interest, the state statute for the purpose of a three-judge jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.406" offset="592959">We understand that the appellees do not contest position.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.437" offset="613125">And while we understand of course that jurisdiction of this Court cannot be conferred by consent, we feel the matter is now so clear that jurisdiction is proper, that unless the Court wishes me to pursue it, we think we can accomplish more by moving on.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.770" offset="686477">The second question presented on this appeal is whether one man, one vote applies below the level of state legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.178" offset="720123">We believe the Court should not extend this principle for the reason stated in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.097" offset="743737">The question has been fully argued in the three proceeding cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.253" offset="760351">We have nothing new to add to that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.761" offset="774457">In the brief time available, we wished to cover new arguments, matters that are peculiar to this case and are not involved in the other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.644" offset="817925">Our principal argument therefore is that, while we do not believe the Seventh -- the one man, one vote doctrine should be extended to local government even if it is extended to local government, the Seven-Four Plan of the City of Virginia Beach is a valid plan of representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.405" offset="900995">This brings us to the third and vital question in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.463" offset="925236">We say at the outset, Seven-Four Plan does accord with the Reynolds case and the mandate of one man, one vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.215" offset="972257">Now what is the Seven-Four Plan?</text>
            <text syncTime="219.561" offset="981661">The Solicitor General indicated to you quite properly that this is a plan of at large election of seven councilmen for the City of Virginia Beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.297" offset="1032547">Four are elected without residential requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.466" offset="1053236">They may reside anywhere in the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.910" offset="1063058">The seven others are elected with a residential requirement, one being required to reside in each of seven boroughs of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.867" offset="1106840">The seven boroughs are of disproportionate population ranging from -- according to the 1960 census, 700 and some persons in the smallest to approximately 29,000 persons in the largest.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.561" offset="1177579">Now, we say the plan affords every voter in the city an opportunity to vote for 11 councilman, all of the council.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.579" offset="1225644">The residential requirement does not destroy the fact that each councilman is the city’s councilman and not a councilman merely of the borough in which he resides.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="293.797" offset="1278516">How was that set up on the ballot?</text>

          <turn speaker="harry_frazier_iii" startTime="296.841" stopTime="316.214">
            <label>Mr. Harry Frazier III</label>
            <text syncTime="296.841" offset="1290742">It is set up on the ballot by having the borough election for a resident councilman from Blackwater.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.315" offset="1332642">And the person who has declared or persons who have declared from Blackwater appear with a box opposite their name and you vote for one.</text>

            <text syncTime="316.214" offset="1368273">And everyone in the city votes for one, is that it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry Frazier III</label>
            <text syncTime="319.364" offset="1380812">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.208" offset="1384155">And the same for each of the seven boroughs that large seats without residential requirement, you vote for four out of the number that appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.428" offset="1429086">But the important point in this plan is that the residential feature does not destroy the crucial fact that these people represent all of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.055" offset="1483630">And we feel that the Court had recognized this already.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="350.299" offset="1504528">Oh, what's the purpose of the residential requirement then?</text>

          <turn speaker="harry_frazier_iii" startTime="353.684" stopTime="370.112">
            <label>Mr. Harry Frazier III</label>
            <text syncTime="353.684" offset="1518111">The purpose of the residential requirement is to guarantee that the view points of all sections of an amazingly complex city are going to be presented to its governing body.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="370.112" offset="1583835">What's on the assumption then that people who lived in a certain place are going to have a certain point of view or going -- or suppose to represent the area from which -- in which they reside?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_frazier_iii" startTime="381.682" stopTime="435.797">
            <label>Mr. Harry Frazier III</label>
            <text syncTime="381.682" offset="1630124">I don't think it can be stated quite that way Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.506" offset="1645380">It's on the assumption that they will be familiar with the problems of the area in which they reside.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.098" offset="1671816">They still represent the city as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.789" offset="1682578">And as Mr. Justice Brennan pointed out for this Court in Fortson against Dorsey, the fact that he resides in any given portion of the election district does not make him any -- the less the representative of the entire district, whether it'll be a city as in this case or a county or a state senatorial district as in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.530" offset="1793442">The Court recognizes the crucial fact that the residential requirement does not destroy his citywide standing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="435.797" stopTime="440.789">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="435.797" offset="1846523">He's still responsible in other words for the citywide election and not just to a borough election.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_frazier_iii" startTime="440.789" stopTime="572.548">
            <label>Mr. Harry Frazier III</label>
            <text syncTime="440.789" offset="1866480">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.984" offset="1871287">And the test is that you first determine what the geographical unit is that you're talking about, Virginia Beach City, and then to determine whether your treating everybody within the City of Virginia Beach the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.853" offset="1930742">Now this is the -- if you will, the extreme statement of our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.700" offset="1958222">We believe it to be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.231" offset="1968253">And we believe that this alone would justify the Seven-Four Plan if the Court extends the principle to local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.238" offset="2008273">Yet there is another, and in our view, equally as rational reason for sustaining the plan although it does require considerably more discussion and elaboration.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.805" offset="2074624">That is that the plan of Seven-Four representation can be justified rationally for this City of Virginia Beach because of the peculiar circumstances that exist here.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.543" offset="2133556">And this requires me to come now to the facts of the case and I only hope that I have not kept them from you too long.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.517" offset="2169396">In the first place, I want to answer for the case here a point that Mr. Justice Fortas had raised in the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.581" offset="2221746">There has been some suggestion that the Court may provide a standard or a rule based on the degree of legislative power, the extent of power that the governing body in question had.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.193" offset="2284126">That question -- that solution is of no significance here because the Council of the City of Virginia Beach exercises all local power.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.095" offset="2323728">There is no overlapping jurisdiction, there is no town, there is no county, any power exercised at the local level is exercised by this City Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.719" offset="2366255">So we think it's important for the Court to understand the different posture of this case (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <text syncTime="772.265" offset="3192456">With large water areas in it, it is a truly remarkable and unique city.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.773" offset="3222444">Now this city is a result of a consolidation of a little city, former City of Virginia Beach, which was nothing but a seaside resort of about 8000 people and Princess Anne County which included the same amalgamation, conglomeration of development.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.149" offset="3327979">The residential suburbs of the Norfolk area and the farming land, a consolidation of a small city and a large county, a county large in both population and in area.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.099" offset="3379806">This consolidation took place pursuant to a plan and a referendum which passed in both the city and the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.060" offset="3419617">The initial plan was to consolidate the governing bodies of a former city and a former county into one.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.090" offset="3451695">That was a five-man City Council from the former City of Virginia Beach, they were elected at large, and the six-man board of supervisors from former Princess Anne County elected on a district basis and the districts were disproportionate in population.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.090" offset="3547721">The -- this you see is the essence of the seven boroughs we have now.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.194" offset="3564126">They are the same as the magisterial districts in the former county plus the old City of Virginia Beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.233" offset="3592338">The consolidation took place according to state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.963" offset="3607176">And as Mr. Justice Stewart observed yesterday, one of the problems when you consolidate people is to guarantee to minority groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.616" offset="3649808">Some say about what their government is.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.791" offset="3662555">So the initial system preserved to the City of Virginia Beach within 8000 people, five men on an eleven-man council.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.819" offset="3702680">But this has been changed because in the challenge of the system, the District Court held the system to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.580" offset="3749700">And although the order -- owning it unconstitutional was not a final appealable order and the matter was deferred until the next General Assembly of Virginia because the City Council had already before its plan had been declared unconstitutional agreed to change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.164" offset="3823992">The plan was changed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.541" offset="7845491">Before examining the parochial defects of the Seven-Four Plan which stand condemned by unanimous opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, I know that this case will be that platform for setting the guidelines for other cities across the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.568" offset="7917693">And we respectfully submit that the natural supplementation of the Sims case would be somewhat phrased as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.956" offset="7959176">Whenever a citizen is given a statutorial right to vote for any candidate or on any issue, the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that equal weight and influence must be given to each and every vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.052" offset="8031587">Justice Fortas' dissenting opinion in Fortune against Morris, I say becomes decisive and majority language when considered in a case where the state has decided that there shall be an election in which citizens have the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.411" offset="8121031">Justice Fortas stated a vote is not an object of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.672" offset="8138062">It is the sacred, most important instrument of democracy and of freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.615" offset="8157811">In simple terms, the vote is meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.744" offset="8170350">It no longer serves the purpose of the democratic society unless it taken in the aggregate with the votes of other citizens results in affecting the will of those citizens provided that they are more numerous than those of differing views.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.878" offset="8234924">We submit that what this Court has previously said is that, the vote is the only way the American citizen has to speak politically and that there will no -- there will be no degrees of freedom of political speech by diluting or debasing the full expression of his vote whether that's scheme be sophisticated or whether it be apparent as it knows on one space.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.683" offset="8354147">We're getting now to the case as before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.822" offset="8382673">It started out, how did the City of Virginia Beach come about?</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.257" offset="8400436">What is the genesis of it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.251" offset="8408377">It came about because under the laws of the State of Virginia one city cannot annex another city.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.868" offset="8434813">And Princess Anne County was seeking immunization from the oddly urban scroll of the City of Norfolk and in order to buy that immunization they had to guarantee to the supervisors on the board of supervisors of Princess Anne County which was elected by wards or districts, and had to guarantee to the five members of the City Council of the Resort City of Virginia Beach who were elected at large, they had to guarantee them their seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.563" offset="8557589">And that is what has spoiled the constitutionality of the present government of Virginia Beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.745" offset="8586324">When you attempt to mix the hard political bargaining that may come in a merger or arrangement with the guarantee of one man, one vote, it will no longer -- it will no more mix and -- and oil will mix with water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.482" offset="8661347">The first plan, the City of Virginia Beach admitted, was unconstitutional, the faster resolutions that they will go into the General Assembly to seek a representative form of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.767" offset="8710457">So Judge Hoffman who had condemned that plan, he being the dissenter in the three-judge federal court ruling in Mann against Davis, it came up and it was affirmed by this Court, Judge Hoffman gave him an opportunity to go to the next General Assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.378" offset="8772838">Now if the Court please, when you go to the General Assembly -- may I take any state legislature that the committee on county citizen towns operates on the matter of local privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.383" offset="8812857">If I come up there with a charter arrangement to divide the City of Norfolk into a thousand and one parts or the City of Virginia Beach in 2000 parts, if that's what the legislative says, that the City Council wants, that's what the City Council gets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.073" offset="8875656">So there is no real overall legislative analysis or a particular change in a local charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.024" offset="8907421">So they thought they would see if they could pass a muster with the Seven-Four Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.716" offset="8926229">And the test really in this case, one of the test, other than the annunciation of a broad principle with respect to city and forms of government is going to test the language of Chief Justice Warren when he wrote the majority opinion in Reynolds against Sims, when it was stated that sophisticated plan and substance are -- sophisticated plan would fail just as quickly as would one that respect patently unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.001" offset="9087352">Because here, this merger or bargaining that took place, it was designed not to change a single geographical limit of a single magisterial district in the old Princess Anne County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.994" offset="9111385">It was designed to make sure that the rule-oriented supervisor could be guaranteed election on the new City Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.701" offset="9198216">What did the Seven-Four Plan do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.695" offset="9206157">It didn't change a single geographical line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.767" offset="9222457">Although the statutes of the State of Virginia require that when a city shall have wards, those wards shall be changed from time to time either every ten years or sooner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.959" offset="9271254">So that in each ward there will be as near as possible the same number of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.010" offset="9295391">Virginia has led the nation in the app -- in their early application of one man, one vote to congressional, to state, and to local reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.829" offset="9334680">Sometimes the elected officials have blinked at the very clear log that it is written in all levels of government in the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.094" offset="9379715">So not a single geographical change was made and they found a way to guarantee that the election of the people from the sparsely settled borough Pungo where I think in Blackwater, where there were about 733 people compared to Bayside where there were 28,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.022" offset="9487444">Now these people in the populous areas which are the voters that constitute the plaintiffs in this case, the appellees before this case, they are concerned with the fact that schools have to be built almost overnight that as these apartment houses go up and these housing projects spread out from the urban core of Norfolk into the City of Virginia Beach, these problems must be solved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.268" offset="9592456">And the slow pace of the agrarian society, the only problem that is really so complicated down there is the very natural desire of the man who was in Pungo and back there in that great duck hunting country, he doesn't want to have to pay the cost of a bursting of population that's going to create the stupendous rise in the cost of government that's involved in fire, police, and school protection for these thousands --</text>

            <text syncTime="2707.166" offset="10932015">At that time, it was described what the role of cities would be in Virginia namely that they are arms of the state for discharging certain state functions and they are government within themselves with all of the legislative powers, and governing powers that the council for -- appellants have sought -- conceded.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry Frazier III</label>
            <text syncTime="2799.812" offset="11302640">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.981" offset="11307342">I believe two things should be said in reply to Mr. Howell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.459" offset="11333256">First, he artfully suggests that this plan is contrary to the law of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.186" offset="11360110">He doesn't say it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.396" offset="11368991">He conveys that impression an unmistakable effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.629" offset="11385919">Has not so -- Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia had determined that the policy of the state which does favor boroughs of equal population -- wards of equal population does not require it in the City of Virginia Beach which has especially conferred charter by the General Assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.008" offset="11475362">So let's make it perfectly clear that despite these references, to what the policy of the state is, the plan that we have here is not contrary to the law of the Commonwealth of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.265" offset="11528443">The only question is whether it's contrary to the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment if that is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.739" offset="11566373">Now the second thing that I feel we must point out in reply to Mr. Howell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.791" offset="11594585">He is strangely silent about minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.122" offset="11611826">And I know Mr. Howell better than you gentlemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.029" offset="11623528">One of Mr. Howell's greatest concerns back home is minorities, but he's strangely silent when we come to minorities in the City of Virginia Beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.293" offset="11672534">We're talking not about a racial minority, were talking about economic minority groups here, agriculture, the largest industry in the City of Virginia Beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.134" offset="11715897">Agricultural lands occupy over more than half of the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.848" offset="11738781">But he would provide no means of any effective representation for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.513" offset="11765426">He doesn't even face up to the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.278" offset="11776502">In this we feel is ignoring a responsibility of local government that it must make it possible for minority views to be expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.680" offset="11830105">There are two cases that deal on this that are mentioned in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.223" offset="11852257">One mentioned by the Solicitor General involving in the City of New York where borough -- five boroughs each have two elected at large within the borough but not more than one can be from any political party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.992" offset="11931355">It's an effort ignoring one man, one vote for the purpose of ten of the 37 councilman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.113" offset="11959777">It is a conscious effort to provide representation to minority groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.020" offset="11983496">And you an have more than one from a political party.</text>

            <text syncTime="2988.231" offset="12056325">Because the people who are elected from the smaller boroughs will constitute at most three or four out of eleven members so they can't run anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.877" offset="12098853">And this is why we think this is the only plan that we've been able to come up with that guarantees an expression of the view points from minority interest and yet ensures that the majority will always have the opportunity to control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.286" offset="12172518">They don't have to pay any attention on the deliberations of the city council to those who were residents of the smaller boroughs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.373" offset="12208880">But they do have to give them an opportunity to be heard.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="3030.250" offset="12224345">But if the principle of equal protection is not applied and we followed your doctrine, would it not be possible there are other circumstances to so arrange the boroughs of the county so minorities would have absolutely no place in government at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3055.859" offset="12326849">But well -- we are saying is you can extend equal protection to the City of Virginia Beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.487" offset="12349315">But there are reasons, two particular reasons why you should affirm or validate the Seven-Four Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.958" offset="12387244">It's opportunity for all to participate in the election of all councilmen and the unusual circumstances, the rational justification for the plan viewed in the light of these circumstances.</text>
