            <text syncTime="27.536" offset="213556">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.113" offset="227871">The overriding issue we have in these cases today is, we submit, more fundamental to the plan of Government we have chosen for ourselves and the troubling question of racial discrimination that's also involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.443" offset="297148">Now, these issues are raised by two cases which are the subject of the joint petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.680" offset="338108">One was instituted in 1963 prior to the adoption of the measure which has been invalidated by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.751" offset="378337">It was a suit for damages and injunctive relief against Mr. Reitman, the owner of a multiple dwelling apartment, for refusal to rent an apartment to Mr. and Mrs. Mulkey, solely upon the grounds of their race.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.601" offset="441762">That case was at issue and untried at the time in November 1964, when by popular vote, the people of California adopted a measure popularly known as Proposition 14, adding to the State constitution in section 26 of Article I of that constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.312" offset="528593">Shortly thereafter, Mr. Snyder, the other petitioner in this case, who owned a six-and-a-half unit building in an apartment dwelling in Beverly Hills, set a notice of termination to Mr. and Mrs. Prendergast of being a Negro and a Caucasian married couple.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.542" offset="629530">And after the receipt of that notice, Mr. and Mrs. Prendergast filed an action for injunctive relief to enjoin the termination of this oral tenancy which under California laws is terminable on a 30-day written notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.554" offset="705599">Both of -- the rights claimed by both of these plaintiffs in both actions was based exclusively on the provisions of a California statute as amended in 1959, known and referred to in our brief as the Unruh Act, which started of in 1893, I believe, as a typical public accommodation statute preventing racial discrimination in all places of public accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.784" offset="818552">And in 1959 was amended by the California Legislature to prohibit racial and religious discrimination in business establishments of every kind whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.478" offset="869334">Within a couple of years after that the statute was passed, the California courts construed it to include, among other businesses, the business of renting multiple dwellings as small as three-unit dwellings.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.778" offset="930461">Accordingly, these actions were brought and as I say or the plaintiffs relied exclusively on the provisions of statutes adopted in 1959.</text>

            <text syncTime="222.448" offset="993155">The Rumford Act was adopted, Your Honor, in 1963, to extend the so-called Hawkins Act which was an Act adopted at the same time as the Unruh Act, the Hawkins Act prohibiting racial discrimination in publicly assisted housing accommodations.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.786" offset="1078523">In June 1963, the California Legislature adopted what's known as the Rumford Act extending the provisions of the Hawkins Act to include certain types of private dwellings.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.950" offset="1135156">Now, the Unruh Act is the Act under which both of these actions were brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.635" offset="1161906">And under the provisions of the Rumford Act, a complainant is giving his -- given his option whether to proceed under the provisions of the Unruh Act, if he's dealing with what concept -- with a business establishment or to proceed with an administrative agency the Fair Employment Practices Commission if he wishes the remedy provided for in the Rumford Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.084" offset="1435669">Now, the Court -- the trial courts in the -- in the -- the Reitman case, Mulkey v. Reitman, as it is known, if the Court you will, entertained a motion which for practical purposes was a motion for a judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendant following the adoption of this constitutional Amendment, it being urged, that this Amendment, at the very least, had the effect of repealing, pro tanto, the provisions of the Unruh Act, which as I said, was the exclusive basis for the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.514" offset="1589478">The issue, as treated by the trial court and by the parties, was based solely on the ground that the plaintiff urged that the measure was unconstitutional and did not validly affect the repeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.772" offset="1646425">The defendant urged that it was valid under the Federal Constitution and that -- that it did affect the repeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.485" offset="1673279">The trial court ruled in favor of the defendant, entered judgment for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.472" offset="1693236">That judgment was reversed by the California Supreme Court on the grounds of section 26 did not accomplish a repeal, because it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and that is one of the judgments here on review.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.617" offset="1765857">In the Prendergast case, the landlord filed a cross-complaint, in which he took the position that he had a right to terminate an oral tenancy for any reason or for no reason at all, unless it was prohibited by some valid, regulatory statute, adopted under some constitutional grant of power and relying on the theory, of course, that section 26 had repealed any such regulatory statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.236" offset="1916322">Therefore, the state of the law was that there was no statute on the subject and he cross-complained for declaratory relief that he'd be given possession of his property, having validly terminated the tenancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.958" offset="1983195">The trial court in that case, although it upheld the constitutionality of section 26 and a companion case, held that section 26 was inapplicable to this situation, but then under there's the doctrine of -- under his interpretation of the decision of this Court in Shelley versus Kraemer, as -- as interpreted by what the intermediate appellate court of California in the Abstract Development Company case cited in our brief that even though there was no statute preventing a termination of this lease on racial ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.380" offset="2148916">Even though it was -- it was not subject to statutory regulation or to put it another way, even if they had a right to do it for any reason or for no reason at all, that nevertheless, the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited a state court from recognizing the termination of the tenancy if it were based on racial considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.911" offset="2263019">That judgment was appealed to the California Supreme Court and was affirmed, not only on the ground relied upon by the trial court, but also upon the ground that section 26, appended the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.774" offset="2342431">Now, if I might mention, just briefly the court below, relied very heavily on the --</text>

            <text syncTime="620.964" offset="2587251">The narrow issue that would determine these two cases would be, does section 26 validly effect a repeal of the Unruh Act insofar as it applied to housing accommodations because if invalidly accomplished a repeal, it may be invalid on some other theory, but the repealing effect would enable the Court to make a judgment in this case on the facts of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.557" offset="2721625">So, there is a question whether the repealing effect of section 26, which I believe the respondents and all the friends of the Court in this case, conceived that it was intended to effect a pro tanto repeal of the pre-existing legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.492" offset="2793305">And there is a question of whether that effect can be severed from whatever else there is in the measure that this Court might believe to append the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1015.508" offset="4165360">There's no evidence on the Mulkey case as to (Inaudible) of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.425" offset="4245086">Now, the rationale of the California Supreme Court invalidating this measure was that California became responsible for the racial discrimination of these petitioners because California had taken what it called affirmative action of a legislative nature designed to make possible discriminatory conduct which had previously been prohibited by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.345" offset="4372773">The implication, of course, from that kind of language is, had there been no such statute, then there would no constitutional invalidity in section 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.855" offset="4430764">Indeed, the Court says, by way of dictum in the Mulkey opinion and by way of holding in a companion case entitled Hill versus Miller that the State had no -- affirmative constitutional duty to provide a remedy against private racial discrimination it held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.147" offset="4519999">And that, in California, there is no right of action for -- by a Negro, for example, against the property owner for racial discrimination in housing accepting only as it's regulated by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.709" offset="4586245">So, as we said before, we think the rationale of the court below was a repeal of these statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.215" offset="4624280">This reversible of policy, as they put it, from one where California had first prohibited racial discrimination, then, they adopted section 26 which lifted this prohibition that that change of direction made California responsible for racial discrimination that occurred in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3821.036" offset="15387564">Well, we have -- we have argued although the state court did not -- did not -- to place his position upon this ground, we have argued that one of the abridging aspects in section 26, is that it destroys the right of petition to the state court to recognize or create a common-law action for racial discrimination, as the California Courts did in the case of racial discrimination of the labor union, but the -- the question of whether -- had there been no section 26, had there been no Rumford or Unruh Act, the question whether we would have a situation any different from the one that is now created by section 26, assuming for the purpose of that, that section 26 does nothing more, but create a reversion in time back to the situation before Unruh and Rumford.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.994" offset="15607306">The question there obviously, ties right in to Mr. Pruitt's invocation of the transcendental issue of a form of our government because it brings us right up, it -- it seems to me, it brings us right up to the question of, What is -- what is the substantial content of the doctrine of state action?</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.492" offset="15685360">Now, it isn't merely a literal adherence to the words no State in the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.106" offset="15711796">Why do we have the requirement that the Fourteenth Amendment does not have a direct prohibitory force against private conduct, but only against the conduct or the action of the State?</text>
            <text syncTime="3912.155" offset="15752025">It is -- if I read my history, if I read these first civil rights cases correctly, it is because of the adherence to the proposition of the kind of federalism upon which this country was founded, requires that matters of local providence should stay local unless the State in -- acts in such a way, a respect of them is to violate the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.452" offset="15853171">Now, what is the meaning of that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.544" offset="15865501">It was referenced to racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3943.133" offset="15875950">Before Rumford and Unruh, or that legislation, it was, I suppose, true to say, legalistically true, that was one free to refuse to sell or rent on racial grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.776" offset="15946480">That was true only, however, because of state in action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.296" offset="15964557">The State of California had never got around facing up to the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.230" offset="15980335">I'd never got around doing anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.661" offset="15990053">It had drifted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3972.872" offset="15994859">It had drifted into the policy of permitting racial discrimination, not permitting, but that, at least, tolerating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.991" offset="16027355">Now, if we let inaction, if we let inaction be the approval of state action under the Fourteenth Amendment, then we have centralized practically all regulatory control here in Washington because the great bulk of man's activity, the great bulk of man's activity are carried on lawfully only because the State has never gotten around to prohibiting them more regularly.</text>

            <text syncTime="4003.782" offset="16118471">Well, the difficulty that I have is that, if the people of California say to their legislature, If there's going to be any legislation on this subject, we're going to exercise that power through the process of constitutional amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4022.168" offset="16192031">Now, if that is what section 26 amounts to, that is, it presents some very difficult problems in your point of view, obviously.</text>
            <text syncTime="4033.585" offset="16237693">On the other hand, if section 26, is a direction to the California Courts to that -- yet saying in effect that they cannot exercise powers which they would otherwise have.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.163" offset="16311986">So it might be that that is a very different kind of a matter because it's not the people withdrawing some power that they have pro tanto with growing power that they vested in the legislature, but it is -- it is a qualitatively, a different matter, at least this is argued correctly.</text>

            <text syncTime="4073.102" offset="16395786">There is a difference between the two -- the two effects of the sections supposed, but of course, section 26 is not limited barely to a declaration of hereafter.</text>

            <text syncTime="4093.251" offset="16476348">In goes beyond that because a necessary operation's in effect until such times the people act in the future it has made racial -- freedom of racial discrimination, I should take a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.152" offset="16527966">It is whatever the Constitution -- made it inviolable, and as matter of fact though, while -- while it can -- it can have a much broader operation under this, had the least cases, it was what precipitated the question in these cases because in -- until section 26 was adopted, the California courts had no reason to dismiss the cases or to have to argue with anything, but hear them on the merits and decide what relief, if any, the plaintiffs had -- were entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4135.944" offset="16647189">But as soon as section 26 came on, the effect of section 26 was to remove those cases from the power of the court to deal with in any effective way.</text>

            <text syncTime="4506.125" offset="18127914">Well, isn't it, Mr. Selvin, isn't it just that it's told its people, but rather that the people have told their legislature that the legislature which is the ordinary body of the law-making may not have to implement what might have (Inaudible) by law are federal guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4533.180" offset="18236061">The state action in that sense, I assume people can tell the people anytime they want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4540.142" offset="18263960">But here, what the people have done is to say that the ordinary process is in the State, that is say, the enactment of legislation shall not be available for the purpose of well, preventing racial discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="4557.192" offset="18332191">In fact this is what the State has done?</text>
            <text syncTime="4560.376" offset="18344835">Then has it not in effect -- in substantial effect encouraged those who want and are willing to discriminate?</text>
            <text syncTime="4569.118" offset="18379839">And isn't that encouragement just as much on constitutional state action as on a higher plane, coercion would be?</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.813" offset="18414634">That -- that is our point and that's what I meant when I said that insofar as it as within the power of the State to do so, of course, the State can't repeal the Constitution of the United States and incidentally, not all 18 million people of California can repeal the Constitution of the United States, as I think this Court told Colorado in Lucas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4597.149" offset="18491956">But -- so that the fact that the people adopted this Amendment is beside, but the State, insofar as it is possible for it to do so, has assured its citizens that nothing is going to happen to them on account of racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4613.958" offset="18559248">Isn't it assumed that all it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4616.471" offset="18569279">Assume that all of section 26 is, it's a more or less academic preachment to its people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.356" offset="18596760">Is it any the less of an encouragement in that regard, than the statements issued by the Mayor and Chief of Police in Lombard?</text>
            <text syncTime="4629.573" offset="18621628">They weren't coercive, they weren't binding on the people, but they published statements saying, "Don't protest."</text>
            <text syncTime="4635.442" offset="18645138">And that -- and it was that part, that activity on the part of two city officials that this Court -- that this Court held to be the involvement of the State in the private racial discrimination that was going on in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4649.294" offset="18700518">Now, here's a statement published in a newspaper in Lombard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4653.074" offset="18715669">Here is a provision of the said Constitution of California found on the same article as it guarantees a free speech religion of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="4661.338" offset="18748688">Isn't that -- isn't that some kind of an encouragement?</text>
            <text syncTime="4664.577" offset="18761644">And if it's an encouragement, it must be an involvement within the meaning of the decisions of this Court, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="4672.255" offset="18792364">Now, when you have authorization by making it a constitutional right, when you have encouragement, when you have the withdrawal of the State from the field and the abdication of whatever responsibility it may have for providing its citizens with remedies for injuries, you have, I submit, a fairly strong case of involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4696.725" offset="18890271">Now, there are -- what I have said, insofar as it applies at all, is equally -- is applicable to the two cases that are here under the one written.</text>

            <text syncTime="4719.286" offset="18980551">I'm going to say very little about separability, because it is my understanding that the Solicitor General may touch on that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="4726.825" offset="19010644">Separability or severability, of course, is a state question, but I would like to just devote, to explain what it was that the court below held in respect to severability.</text>
            <text syncTime="4740.004" offset="19063411">Section 26 contains not a single word of repeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4744.764" offset="19082428">It doesn't say the Rumford Act is repealed, the Unruh Act is repealed or anything else is repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4749.664" offset="19102072">It lays down a general proposition that the right -- the right to refuse to sell, shall not be limited, abridged, or impaired by any of -- by the State or any of its agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4763.754" offset="19158392">The reason Rumford and Unruh are deemed to be repealed by that, is because they are inconsistent with that substantive proposition of law enacted by section 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="4777.792" offset="19214503">Now, it is that substantive proposition that involves the State by our submission, that involves the State in the private conduct, and therefore, it is that substantive proposition of law that raises the constitutional questions that are being argued here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4793.675" offset="19278033">Unless -- unless that substantive provision is itself valid, there can be no repeal because repeal is a function of the -- is a function of the substantive provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.867" offset="19326830">What the California Court held was, and this is California Law, and it may be good law or bad law, but it's California Law and for this purpose, it's conclusive, because severability is a state question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4817.705" offset="19374164">What the California Court held and all that it held, this discussion will be found on pages 29, 30, and 31 of the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.247" offset="19408332">Then they did not go in the law or in the convolutions to which Mr. Pruitt referred, at least, not as I read the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4832.627" offset="19433932">What it did hold was simply this, that we can't rewrite the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4839.143" offset="19459950">If we can excise the part that renders the statute unconstitutional, and what is left is constitutional, we will give force to what is left.</text>
            <text syncTime="4848.695" offset="19498193">But here, here is the thing that's unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.067" offset="19511672">The part of the statute that's unconstitutional is this one sentence that establishes the substantive proposition of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4858.880" offset="19538944">Excise that from the statute and there's nothing left to effect that it'd repeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.080" offset="19559737">That was the California Court's decision on severability and as -- in complete accord with the California decision, and it is entirely a matter for the state court.</text>
