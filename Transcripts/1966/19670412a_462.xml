            <label>Mr. Hugh Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="20.762" offset="186389">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.654" offset="201958">In the few minutes remaining to me, I should like to discuss the question of notice which is the essential nexus of the argument made by Mr. Ely in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.201" offset="268204">In accordance with the statute in 1955, the Federal Power Commission gave notice of our application for a preliminary permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.037" offset="299551">And the question that Mr. Ely raises is what at that point happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.314" offset="312613">Now whatever that notice meant to anybody or to Mr. Ely or anyone else, there's one thing quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.289" offset="348557">It did not mean that we were going to build the project described in that notice because as Mr. Solomon explained to you at some length yesterday and as I've commented, this is the one thing you do know, and that experience is shown that everybody involved in this particular activity knows that it is so unlikely that anything is going to come up, its exactly what's describe.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.659" offset="441971">Anyone reading that notice knew that whatever else it might mean it did not mean that that was the project that was going to be built.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.418" offset="477080">Now we say that the notice served its statutory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.900" offset="502993">And that is that there had been set in motion this statutory process which would eventuate in a project best adapted to a comprehensive plan within the standards of Section 10 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="114.021" offset="559417">And, that consequently anyone who had purposes or plans or ambitions that would be affected by that eventuality were on notice that the time had come for them to come in and take the obligation, undertake the obligation if they wished to assert a preference to undertake the obligation to carry out the expirations to develop the particular project.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.612" offset="665788">Now, viewed in light of this statutory purpose, I think that it is clear that the scope that the Commission has given to a preliminary permit is a very sensible and workable rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.666" offset="737991">Because what the Commission has said in this case is that a permit applies to the project described, to any project that is mutually exclusive so long as it occupies substantially the same reach of the river and substan -- and develops substantially the same head.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.964" offset="827225">Now the phrase is substantially the same, are concepts that are very familiar to lawyers, something that violate is not an exact rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.398" offset="860975">It is something that lawyers are accustomed to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.517" offset="877484">Reach and head are of course more engineering terms but they're very familiar to engineers, and the engineers are the people who are involved in this kind of a thing we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.743" offset="922311">And it's very workable to them, and mutually exclusive as something that anybody even the layman can easily see once they look at the map.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.700" offset="962121">Even this map by Mr. Ely shows immediately what we've got in this little area up here that I can cover with my hand is mutually exclusive and that consequently this is what is now involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.024" offset="1011440">Now this is a very workable thing, you see.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.383" offset="1020949">It's a very easy thing, the nature of the resource automatically tells anybody that this is what is about to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.023" offset="1055431">Now, of course Mr. Ely argues this isn't what the notice was.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.228" offset="1076328">That all it was, was that this is like a illegal process which were not â€“ this isn't really illegal process, it's the process of developing a resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.485" offset="1113318">But let's for the moment look at his argument which is a technical argument on notice, it's almost black letter law, that a person who asserts a right -- be on the ground of faulty notice has got to come in and show at least three things, that he has a right to notice, that notice was given, that he saw that notice, that he relied upon that notice to his injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.957" offset="1227212">Now, it's quite evident that as far as the particular petitioner in this case is concerned, no one of those requirements can be met because WPP -- the supply system was not even in existence in 1954 when this all started.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.298" offset="1296593">When it came into existence and came into this case, the claim of Pacific Northwest that we were operating under -- our preliminary permit was abundantly claimed and consequently it seems to me that as far as the supply system is concerned, they've got to stand or fall on the legal effect of the permit that was granted to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.937" offset="1379140">They have no technical right to assert notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.430" offset="1393142">But let us even pass that by for the moment and assume that the supply system can stand on the shoes of either what they call their predecessors and interests which doesn't really do them much good because their predecessors and interests were not construction agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.719" offset="1474226">They obviously were not agencies that had the capacity to start so that -- they had no interest in the notice or even -- or leading that and going back to the individual public utility districts of which they are composed.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.443" offset="1533158">Let's say that they could assert faulty notice there.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.627" offset="1545906">Now, the one clear thing that we could see in this record is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.093" offset="1563773">If any public util -- if any qualified public agency in the Northwest had in 1954 any ambitions to build High Mountain Sheep and it sat back as Mr. Ely says they would and had not come in because they were misled by this notice, what would have happened was that the first pleading that ever came into this case, somebody would have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.014" offset="1655411">We would have had some evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.170" offset="1664084">This is the kind of thing on which evidence is the easiest thing to produce, the most persuasive, of the most easy thing, and we have no such evidence at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.635" offset="1701909">There's a broad generalized statement made by Mr. Ely where he says they, the whole area.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.012" offset="1735450">But in fact, nobody relied on this and we all know that they didn't.</text>

            <label>Mr. Northcutt Ely</label>
            <text syncTime="594.205" offset="2480149">Well, if that question is ever -- that question in the Ninth Circuit is taken off the docket awaiting the decision upon this review of the Commission's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.110" offset="2519855">Now on remand if the Commission decides if this is an issue which contrary to this Court's holdings in the first Iowa case or in the Tacoma case does mean that a state can veto a federal licensee, done that as a matter for another day in litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.937" offset="2583071">It is not right for litigation now.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.067" offset="2599685">Your Honor, we offered a -- pardon, I may say at the outset that we claim a preference which the court below said was clearly applicable in the absence of a preliminary permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.403" offset="2652975">We have offered in our briefs two reasons why this permit is not applicable at the High Mountain Sheep site.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.342" offset="2684740">One is the reason I have argued, the major reason that as a matter of statutory construction and by the language of the permit, it never did apply to the High Mountain Sheep site.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.066" offset="2723610">But we also point out in our briefs which I do not have time to argue, that if this particular permit would encompass this particular site, the permit was a dead permit by the time the license application was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.865" offset="2778781">And I should like to simply refer to the points in the brief -- briefs where that point is discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.398" offset="2800933">This is point number eight in our opening brief, beginning at page 53 where we give in some detail a sequence -- in events the citations of the record and is covered in our reply brief at pages 48 and 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.354" offset="2872822">Pardon me, yesterday Mr. Solomon indicated -- they told the Court quite candidly that the permit did indeed as a matter of law encompassed the High Mountain Sheep site and the Nez Perce site -- may I have the blue overlay.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.128" offset="2943875">The permit is indicated in red on this map, these are the areas shown in the notice and upon the face of a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.965" offset="2971251">What you're about to see is a reproduction of the information on the maps opposite page 3 of our opening brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.371" offset="2996851">And this shows the legal consequences of Mr. Solomon's assertion yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.261" offset="3020466">If indeed the issuance of a permit in 1955 for the area shown in red mainly for the Low Mountain Sheep and Pleasant Valley Dam sites did as a matter of law give this permitee the option, the right to transfer this priority to annul as of the date of issuance of that permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.078" offset="3107715">The High Mountain Sheep and the Nez Perce da -- site, then these were the consequences from the day that permit issued in 1955 describing as I would show in a moment by metes and bounds and records of Public Land Surveys only the area in red.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.227" offset="3168319">The permitee got without ever asking for it, without ever giving notice to anyone and without the permit saying -- so on its face these rights, the exclusive right of occupancy for three years, for three years of the High Mountain Sheep site and Nez Perce to the effect that he got the exclusive right from the Imnaha River and the exclusive right upon the Salmon River up to the Freedom Dam site, these are the areas that would have been flooded by the Nez Perce Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.170" offset="3288064">Now then this disclosure of the permitee's claim was not made until the last day the three years of the permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.097" offset="3335711">On the day it expired, he filed this license application which for the first time, disclosed that he claimed the priority for the High Mountain Sheep site.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.400" offset="3368939">We are now told and that as a candidate, in proper admission by Mr. Solomon that as a matter of law, it also encompassed the Nez Perce Dam site, it didn't encompass High Mountain Sheep.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.191" offset="3412093">Now the problem is transposing this issue to Alaska or any other unknown rivers does a granting of a permit strictly limited to a specific site, give the permitee that kind of an option.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.789" offset="3474578">No one can know from reading the permit, reading the application, reading the map that a company's permit, what is encompassed by that permit?</text>
            <text syncTime="850.762" offset="3506448">Yesterday Mr. Chief Justice Warren asked a question that I don't think was answered and referring to the dams on the cascade map of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.594" offset="3553782">This I believe is at page 525 of the record in volume 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.067" offset="3579591">And the Chief Justice asked whether if a permit had been issued for one of the nine dams that are federal dams as it happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.576" offset="3609684">The downstream from High Mountain Sheep whether the permitee would have got the option, an exclusive right on all nine, the answer Mr. Chief Justice says yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.085" offset="3647718">The answer however depends with this qualification upon the permitee's ingenuity, engineering ingenuity in designing a dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.637" offset="3685961">If you'll pick out again, assume we transpose this problem to Alaska, the Yukon, or wherever you like, we're dealing with the interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.617" offset="3721801">But to keep these names of dams for easy identification and pick out the fits, the middle dam of the nine.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.652" offset="3750013">If we refer to this map, then this means that a permitee for that dam automatically got a preemptive option, a right which displace the public preference on the number one dam upstream even though his plans, his designs, his notice didn't show any interference because of the relative heights of the dams, because he read the right to increase the height of his dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.296" offset="3844577">This was a minor modification, a right that needed no amendment according to the Power Commission Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.497" offset="3877386">Similarly he had an exclusive option upon the downstream dams even though if you look at the map at page 525, the Government's cascade series of maps.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.558" offset="3917615">It would appear that the dams downstream could have no interference, no relationships to the middle dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.718" offset="3946245">This is because the permitee if he comes in and says â€œNo, I have found a way to build a dam at the downstream site, site number nine, downstream, three times the height that anyone else had thought of.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.136" offset="3995878">My engineering is better.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.693" offset="4002147">I've drilled the foundations.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.287" offset="4008521">Then that dam will -- would indeed have interfered with the one that I named in my permit then because they are mutually exclusive, because they would interfere with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.131" offset="4047914">I got the option upon that downstream site too.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.496" offset="4061393">Now this is a strange way to interpret a right in a navigable stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.838" offset="4086680">Mr. Solomon said yesterday that the requirements of a specificity and application for a permit, and the permit itself do mean that you must apply for a specific project and you must describe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.669" offset="4138088">But the reason says he is that this -- the Congress was concerned about excessive land withdrawals under Section 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.404" offset="4169017">Now, mechanically under the regulations, the withdrawal under Section 24 as established by the Commission sending to the Secretary of Interior a copy of its notice that it gave to public agencies, the one notice handed to the Secretary effects ipso facto, a withdrawal of the public lands affected by that project, a rare instance where an individual by filing an application withdraws the lands for his private benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.156" offset="4283956">The carbon copy of the same notice sent to the public agencies and published in the counties where the project lies, do not have this effect according to the counsel for the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.571" offset="4329618">The lands that are covered by the notice of the Secretary are indeed withdrawn and no other lands are withdrawn but the notice of public agencies does not have a meaning on the face of the permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.816" offset="4374653">It is not limited in the withdrawal against the preference right under Section 7 (a) to the lands the power sites described.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.542" offset="4405582">It extends up and down the river to all competing sites.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.209" offset="4420211">Now the question of a notice to which I have referred, I should like to simply say here what I say at page 29 of my opening brief, the question is not whether the issuance of a permit or receive a notice of an application puts everyone on notice that the permitee hopes to build a project and that if he does, this will foreclose the development of competing projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.247" offset="4524387">And the question is not whether the municipality learns somehow of what is going on after that permit issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.282" offset="4548524">It's too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.577" offset="4553644">His preference right upon the competing site, High Mountain Sheep and Nez Perce was killed off the day that permit issued and can never be revived while that permit is alive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.046" offset="4595545">The question is whether the Commission's issuance of a statutory notice to public agencies of a permit application for a specific site on a navigable stream puts them on notice that a permitee is to get an affirmative priority upon all other sites in competition with those that he has preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.954" offset="4683212">Now to translate this to any other field of a public land and navigable streams laws of which the Court is familiar, this means that under the Mineral Leasing Act enacted by the same Congress in 1920, if you apply for a prospecting permit on the public lands, they're good for a limited time just as these permits were described in specific areas, just as this permit did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.388" offset="4776939">And if you drill your well four miles outside the boundaries of your permit which is the distance of High Mountain Sheep was from the nearest boundary of this permit and affect the discovery that somehow you have acquired under the 1920 Mineral Leasing Act a right to a lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.336" offset="4840678">Now Congress never before has granted any options, any floating easements upon either the public lands or this -- the navigable streams of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.765" offset="4886444">And it did not intend we say to disable and cripple the public preference who have carefully made mandatory in the legislative history by giving the permitee this option to roam to transfer his priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.153" offset="4939943">Reference was made yesterday to the legislative history and again this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.297" offset="4956557">I should like to call the Court's attention to a rather careful review of the legislative history in Appendix C to my opening brief, this is at page 19A.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.256" offset="4996368">And on the specific point that has made this morning and yesterday as to whether this priority of preference agencies must be asserted at the permit stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.498" offset="5041403">Congress specifically took up this proposal by utility spokesman and did not adopt it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.483" offset="5069302">Instead, it adopted language that preserved the preference for assertion either at the permit stage or three years later at the licensing stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.314" offset="5104619">And it specifically made it clear -- pardon me, I should give you the citations of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.007" offset="5123427">This point is covered in our reply brief under my heading number 6 beginning to page 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.061" offset="5147564">Congress refused to limit their preference to the permit stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.263" offset="5160417">It preserved it to the licensing stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.983" offset="5171284">Why should a public agency interested in the High Mountain Sheep or Nez Perce be forced to come in with a preemptive permit application because it receives a notice of an application for the project which it feels is worthless and is not going to get a license which is exactly what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.997" offset="5239411">Now bear in mind that under Section 7 (a), a public agency fairly warned, fairly warned, can wipe the (Inaudible) clean of the competing permit application of the company instantly by filing a preemptive permit application of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.722" offset="5306284">There's no conditions to that, whatever.</text>
