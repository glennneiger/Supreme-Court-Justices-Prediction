          <heading>Argument of Charles B. Mahin</heading>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="26.962">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 110, National Woodwork Manufacturer Association et al., Petitioner, versus National Labor Relations Board and Number 111, National Labor Relations Board, Petitioner, versus National Woodwork Manufacturer Association et al.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.474" offset="201226">Mr. Mahin.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_b_mahin" startTime="26.962" stopTime="150.164">
            <label>Mr. Charles B. Mahin</label>
            <text syncTime="26.962" offset="211257">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.496" offset="225364">The petitioner here consists of companies that make doors and millwork.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.597" offset="245739">They manufacture prefabricated doors that are used in constructions throughout the United States in the Philadelphia area.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.464" offset="281266">This case involves a product boycott of these prefabricated doors in Philadelphia by the Philadelphia Carpenters Union, and this went on throughout its five-county jurisdictional area.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.709" offset="334242">Now, the specific questions are, in Number 110, whether the Union's boycott of doors on a so-called Frouge job, violated Section 8 (b) (4) (B) of the Act, that Labor Relations Act, and in Number 111, whether the boycott agreement of Union Rule 17 violated Section 8 (e) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.480" offset="425253">But Your Honors there's a broader question in this case, a question of principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.980" offset="447300">And that is, whether unions throughout the country can draw boycott curtains about their respective communities, banning there from factory-made products and factory-finished products of many kinds.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.802" offset="502575">Because if the Philadelphia Union can draw a -- an embargo upon prefabricated doors in that city, the Electrical Workers Union in Allen Bradley may resume its boycott of electrical equipment and prefabricated products in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.579" offset="573733">The glaziers' union in the Chicago Joliet Contractors case can resume their boycott of pre-glazed factory-made windows and over in Cincinnati, the Carpenters Union can resume its boycott of pre-hung doors as in General Millwork, and on and on.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.764" offset="642382">And that is the reason Your Honors, this public detriment, this adverse effect is the reasons so many industries throughout the country are before the Court here today as amici curiae stressing the illegality of this sort of union boycotts.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="150.164" stopTime="154.385">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="150.164" offset="704031">But what was the basis for the illegality in these other cases?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_b_mahin" startTime="154.385" stopTime="1335.473">
            <label>Mr. Charles B. Mahin</label>
            <text syncTime="154.385" offset="720959">In the other cases, the same provision in 8 (b) (4) (B) in the cases I referred to, except down in Allen Bradley which I'll refer to as an antitrust case.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.283" offset="764531">I'll come to the cases specifically too Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.432" offset="777070">Now, the statutory provisions are contained in our brief in Number 110 at page 2 and I might mention that our brief in that case is a consol -- has a consolidated caption of 110 and 111, and I ask that you disregard the Number 111 on that white document and strike it if you care to.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.156" offset="860035">Now, an offense under 8 (b) (4) (B) embodies two elements, union inducement of employees to strike or coercion of an employer for an object of requiring any person to cease handling of products of another producer or manufacturer or to cease doing business with any other person.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.401" offset="944985">The other statutory provision is Section 8 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="213.651" offset="957942">Now, this was enacted in 1959 to complement and close a loophole in 8 (b) (4) (B).</text>
            <text syncTime="220.670" offset="986049">Now, this Section then in essence makes it unlawful for a union and an employer to enter into any agreement that the employer will cease handling the products of any other person or cease doing ba -- business with any other person.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.818" offset="1050624">Now, the 8 (e) provision has a proviso which is involved here and that is that there is exempted from 8 (e), agreements in the construction industry, relating to the contracting or subcontracting of work to be done at the site of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.577" offset="1117706">Now, what I would like to do if the Court please is to state brief with the nature of the case then go to the 110 case, that's the 8 (b) (4) (B) then the 111 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.391" offset="1156890">Now, the facts can be briefly summarized are not materially in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.038" offset="1175489">These prefabricated doors, are doors which are sized, cut, pre-hung, laminated, treated or in some other ways substantially fabricated at the factory.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.645" offset="1234004">They have economic and aesthetic advantages, was testified and they're being used increasingly in construction throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.697" offset="1266186">The core of the Union's boycott campaign was Rule 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.432" offset="1289070">Now, the key part of this rule was, and it's quoted in our brief 110, page 7, beginning at the second sentence, "No member of this district counsel will handle material coming from a mill where cutting out and fitting has been done."</text>
            <text syncTime="312.361" offset="1352808">And going on, "nor any doors or transoms which have been fitted prio -- prior to being finished on the job."</text>
            <text syncTime="319.983" offset="1383320">Now, this Rule 17 by its terms and as enforced by the Union, barred prefabricated doors from Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.984" offset="1419264">The particular difficulties started in February 1963 when the Philadelphia Union manager wrote to President Hutcheson of the Brotherhood of Carpenters, the national organization, that there was a serious problem of prefabricated doors flowing into Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.839" offset="1494706">This was followed by the campaign to bar doors and that resulted in the four cases we have as the basis of this case today.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.699" offset="1530128">And today, there are boycotts on four jobs, hospital jobs, school jobs and housing job, and the last one was the contractor Frouge job that I had mentioned earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.298" offset="1576521">On these first three jobs, the prefab doors were specified by the owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.382" offset="1600867">On the Frouge job, there was an open specification on Frouge that he used these doors because they save time and money.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.247" offset="1636394">But the essential feature of the case, if the Court please, is that the union conduct on all four jobs was exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.216" offset="1672234">The Union enforcing Rule 17, refused to install over 4000 jobs -- doors, made by manufacturers in Wisconsin, Penns -- Pennsylvania and Indiana who where the charging parties in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.514" offset="1729390">Now, the decisions below, on 8 (b) (4) (B) were, that the Board and the Court found, that the Union's boycotts on these first three jobs were illegal under 8 (b) (4) (B) because the real targets of the Union were the prefabricated doors and those who manufactured them and distributed and used them.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.198" offset="1812146">The Court likened the boycott to the one in the Allen Bradley case and the Joliet Contractors case.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.356" offset="1840776">But on the first job, the Board held there was no violation because the specifications didn't require Frouge to use these doors and under the Board's new control theory which is the issue in 8 (b) (4) (B), Frouge was the sole objective and the Court apparently going on on this theory agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.350" offset="1916740">With reference to Section 8 (e), the Board held that Rule 17 was only a work preservation rule, non-violative 8 (e), the Court reversed and held that Rule 17's ban on the prefabricated doors violated 8 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="469.482" offset="1981315">Now, turning first to the 110 case, we have in this case if the Court please, a typical form of product boycott, which is consistently been held illegal for 20 years except for these recent decisions of the Board since 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.217" offset="2052263">Now, this marked change in the thinking of the Board, as revealed by the fact that the general counsel for the Board only three years ago in accordance with his then understanding of the law filed a complaint and prosecuted the case on essentially the same basis that we are contending before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.038" offset="2127496">Now, the Board reversed its general counsel and today of course counsel is supporting the Board's current position.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.118" offset="2151842">I'd like to call first the attention at our brief page 20 that -- that the statutory language of Section 8 (b) (4) (B), is aimed precisely at the type of boycott conduct carried on by the Union under Rule 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.341" offset="2212760">The language is plain, contractor Frouge as a person, the prefab doors which he was forced to stop using, are products manufactured by other producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.579" offset="2253720">Now, Your Honors, there is nothing in the statute nor in the legal history that provides product boycott immunity because of the immediate employer's legal freedom to comply with the Union's boycott demand, nor is there anything which relates to the Union's desire to preserve work.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.509" offset="2329370">On the contrary, the circumstances which led directly to 8 (b) (4) (B) in 1947 and the legislative history demonstrate that Congress intended to outlaw just this kind of a boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.640" offset="2381928">Now, as I reviewed in our brief, page 110 and page 21, a prime concern of Congress, and this is a very important point I think, was the embargo and trade restraint aspects of product boycotts.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.609" offset="2461759">Although 8 (b) (4) (B) is a labor law and not an antitrust law, its roots are grounded in antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.765" offset="2498435">Now, this Court pointed out in Allen Bradley applying the Sherman Act and again in inter -- International Rice Milling in applying the Labor Act that this Court over the years has been concerned with two congressional objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.364" offset="2564786">One, which seeks to preserve a business -- competitive business economy and the other which seeks to preserve the rights of labor to preserve its own conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.805" offset="2602611">But Your Honors, the problem is this, that in its recent decisions, the Board has come to disregard this first congressional objective and has focused almost on entirely on the second one, namely that of union self-interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.526" offset="2665514">Now what led the Taft-Hartley in the beginning?</text>
            <text syncTime="643.610" offset="2677844">Because in the Hutcheson case, by this Court and others -- other cases of the same type, at the time of this Court's decision, 1945 in Allen Bradley, union self-interest was recognized as justifying virtually all forms of economic activity including product boycotts.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.670" offset="2762062">And as the Court will recall, Allen Bradley involved an area product boycott in New York City, much like that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.307" offset="2804590">It was if you please a pure embargo type boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.921" offset="2823084">Local 3 there would not install prefabricated and other electrical products made outside of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.469" offset="2853282">It wasn't concerned with the manufacturers or they were, whether they had unions or what their working conditions were, they -- or their union status.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.595" offset="2889749">They even barred products from across the water in Jersey City.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.333" offset="2916707">Now, in that case, the ultimate objective of the Union was obviously work for its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.517" offset="2941471">But the immediate objective as a means to that goal was the boycott of the blacklisted products.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.796" offset="2970520">Now, this Court of course held that the Union conspiracy with -- combined with non-labor entities violated the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.389" offset="3008972">But the significant dictum which triggered the Taft-Hartley Act was that similar boycotts by the Union acting alone were immune from the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.448" offset="3061112">Now, this was the thrust of the case and its impact on congressional thinking in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.891" offset="3094967">The legislative history is revealed in our brief at 110 and I want to refer the Court, if I may, to the brief of amicus associate general -- Associated General Contractors of pages 43 to 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.826" offset="3146689">And I mentioned here just three factors of that history if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.741" offset="3162363">The first is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.169" offset="3172080">In connection with 8 (b) (4) (B), Allen Bradley was the most commonly cited reason for 8 (b) (4) (B).</text>
            <text syncTime="774.422" offset="3201024">Congress went after Congress then testified that that was one of the kind of boycotts, that was intended to be outlawed by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.226" offset="3232266">And in the Senate Report No. 105 itself, this is referred to and even the committee hearings explaining it, are incorporated by reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.435" offset="3269151">It is the one under theory in other words that Your Honors that 8 (b) (4) (B) was directed against the embargo type products that we had that was in Aden -- Allen Bradley and that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.244" offset="3316381">Now, the second history, historical point, that debates are full or pleased by the Taft-Hartley opponents to save what they call justifiable boycotts.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.140" offset="3363924">And these were referred to as boycotts made by non-union people, boycotts where there were subcon -- substandard conditions or boycotts to keep union men from having to work with non-union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.862" offset="3418781">But nobody in that whole history tried to defend or justify these pure product embargo boycotts such as Allen Bradley and the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.647" offset="3461935">These were recognized as indefensible and for instance, Congressman Javits who is one of the leading opponents of the Taft Act, pleading to say what he called justifiable boycotts said this, and we quote this in our brief at page 33, "This is not the kind of boycott which is contrary to the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.317" offset="3548662">That other kind results from a misguided labor union's efforts to keep certain goods out of a market, of new inventions or new methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.557" offset="3581576">But while dealing with this legitima -- legitimate abuse, the bill also has the effect of depriving labor and so forth and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.570" offset="3617625">Now, the third feature of the history, I would invite your attention, to which I invite your attention, is that the language of the proscription part of 8 (b) (4) (B) was specifically changed in conference to make it perfectly clear that unions could no longer plead self-interest as justification for secondary boycotts as they had before Taft-Hartley.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.176" offset="3712084">And our brief on that -- covers that at 33 to 36.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.911" offset="3734967">Now, what was done?</text>
            <text syncTime="909.328" offset="3740714">The words "for the purpose of -- were deleted and the words -- where an object is" were inserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.063" offset="3775613">And as this Court shortly thereafter, explained in the Denver Building Trade's case, our brief page 35, this change was to take care of the situation of dual union objectives, one lawful and one -- one un -- unlawful as we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.897" offset="3846980">Now, the legislative purc -- purpose if the Court please has been faithfully carried out with the Board and the Court since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.529" offset="3881462">The crux of violation under 8 (b) (4) (B) is the existence of an unlawful objective without regard to factors of work preservation or this new one, this new so-called control idea that the Board have, and these cases are reviewed at 35 to 44 of our brief.Now, I'll mention only three here to illustrate the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.615" offset="3965785">The first product boycott case was the Wadsworth's case, hardly involved a boycott of prefabricated building materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.858" offset="3994833">The union in Kansas refused to install prefab components made in Nebraska because of an organizational argument with the manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.321" offset="4028688">But the point here is, that the Union's whole defense was economic self-interest which they had successfully pleaded in every boycott case since 1932, the Norris-LaGuardia Act up to the time of the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.930" offset="4083127">But this was rejected by the Board and later the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.445" offset="4097128">And the Board said, Congress considered the "product boycott" one of the precise evils which the provision was designed the curve and Chairman Herzog concurring said Congress had -- was attempting to deal a death blow, the secondary boycotts, whether for economic or for other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.572" offset="4177690">I must mention then the Joliet Contractors case, this was a parallel of Allen Bradley and the present case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.888" offset="4202872">The glaziers' union in my hometown in Chicago barred all of the glazing in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.469" offset="4225233">No windows glazed at the factory, no window units could be used there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.477" offset="4245295">There was no dispute with the manufacturers, it was a typical work preservation boycott, all must be done on the jobsite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.759" offset="4270373">Now, the Seventh Circuit expressly rejected this work for preservation of argument in the absence of any dispute of the manufacturers, and why, because it was a boycott target.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.259" offset="4312377">And it said, the target was the use of pre-glazed sale in any and all who handled, used or sold such sales, or the intended and actual victims of the boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.504" offset="4357413">Now, the many and many additional cases we cite, but I go on to the third one which I must mention as one of our leading cases, and that is the General Millwork case on the Sixth Circuit, our brief at page 40.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.393" offset="4420942">Now they're speaking for the Sixth Circuit, Mr. Justice Stewart who was then Judge Stewart, held that a union product boycott of pre-hung doors which are the -- the same type of doors which are barred in Philadelphia here, was unlawful despite claims of work preservation and the absence of many dispute with the -- any manufacturer, because the union objective was the boycott of these doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.575" offset="4521671">And as quoted by the Court in reference to the absence of a dispute by the manufacturers, "Neither literally nor implicitly does the Act require the existence of such a dispute as a condition of its operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.021" offset="4579453">And on through the cases until Landrum-Griffin in 1959, when the -- this provision of the Act was not changed except by strengthening it, and we find at that time that Landrum-Griffin as the Court has undoubtedly aware was to plug loopholes in the Taft-Hartley provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.596" offset="4665762">One of them had been revealed by this Court's decision in the Sand Door case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.801" offset="4694601">But the purpose of Landrum-Griffin under 8 (b) (4) (B) was to strengthen the Act and the apparent reliance of the court below on this primary strike proviso which was added -- was misplaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.424" offset="4749040">This proviso was added to merely to make it clear because of a change that has been made, that the Act does not bar primary strikes at a picket line and so forth, such had been held not to have been barred under the Rice Milling case, and the same principles were applied in the cases after Landrum-Griffin as before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.750" offset="4838379">Now, coming to this control theory the Board is talking about now, the basic fallacy of this control theory as applied by the Board, is that it makes the incidental factor of the immediate employer's ability or willingness to capitulate to the boycott demand, control or determinative of the Union's objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.387" offset="4928972">But under the statute in the cases, if the Court please, it is the existence of an actual boycott ob -- objective that's controlling and not the legal or economic ability of any particular employer to capitulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.145" offset="4979963">Therefore, when this Board's control yardstick points to a different objective than the real objective, it necessarily conflicts with the statute, and that's what happened below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.432" offset="5025102">Since contractor Frouge had control, that is the freedom to buy, the Board found he was the Union's sole target.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.770" offset="5062405">But it is patent Your Honors that the Union had the same boycott target on the Frouge job as on the other three jobs for a violation that was for -- found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.164" offset="5103992">By enforcement of Rule 17, the Union prevented the use of prefabricated doors on all four jobs and the only way its goal under 17 could be accomplished on Frouge as the other three was by the prevention of the use of these prefabricated doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.408" offset="5172955">On his brief in 110 here, the Board seems to have shifted its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.050" offset="5191555">And in large part to have abandoned this control basis of its decision, that all -- I appoint it's a -- to its brief in 110 at page 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.257" offset="5232410">It now has resurrected this long discredited theory of work preservation in the absence of a dispute with the employer, and it seeks to justify the Frouge boycott on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.966" offset="5283192">Well, Your Honors, I submit that the Board's shift of position doesn't help its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.466" offset="5305240">Because as we've seen, neither of these factors has ever been a defense under 8 (b) (4) (B) cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.051" offset="5331571">Now, perhaps the quick answer, the best quick answer, that the Board's new contention is its findings on what it told the court below as to its findings of violation on the first three job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.132" offset="5383920">On all four jobs, including the three where violations were found, the factors of work preservation in the absence of a dispute with the manufacturer on which the Board now relies were the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="1760.015" offset="7143424">So what's the problem here?</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.352" offset="7168815">There was -- that the court below found no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.771" offset="7182503">But I submit that the problem is, that the Board has engrafted on 8 (e), an administratively devised exemption for primary work preservation agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.819" offset="7222627">Now, we think the Board is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.971" offset="7235271">By its fixation on work preservation, the Board has disregarded the specific prohibition of agreements to boycott the products of others which is written in the 8 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.065" offset="7283649">Now, these agreements have dual objectives, the work preservations are probably but certainly, the objective of boycotting products of other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.850" offset="7330774">Now, I think what's happened here is that the Board is reverting to the Hutcheson case concept that union self-interest excuses product boycotts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.762" offset="7370376">But as we've seen, Congress intended Taft-Hartley to change that situation and there's no certain that Congress had the same intention when it enacted 8 (e) in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.947" offset="7419173">Now, the Board tries to justify as departure from the strict language of the Act by saying that it can't be interpreted literally because that would ban all primary strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.427" offset="7469119">Although we submit that's not a relevant argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.272" offset="7484479">It's true as the Court explains in Rice Milling, that this does not ban primary strikes and so forth.Because the picket line interference is incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.170" offset="7524080">But here, the fact that it doesn't apply literally, doesn't give the Board free reign to depart from the Act in other situations and write in its own limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1896.076" offset="7687711">The boycott of other people is not the objective of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.188" offset="7704116">The interference with others is only incidental to the basic strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.761" offset="7722402">But when the boycott of other people becomes a subject of the strike, the boycott is not incidental but certainly is the and at least an object of the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.317" offset="7764616">The struck employer is powerless to grant the Union's demand except by boycotting and discontinuing the handling of the products of other people and in Philadelphia here for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.327" offset="7812681">These contractors could not comply with Rule 17, except by boycotting the products of our charging parties in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.527" offset="7853432">Now, the answer of course is what Congress intended and the legislative history on 8 (e) is an important factor here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.045" offset="7883525">We submit that the congressional intent on the phase of the statute and the legislative history demonstrate that 8 (e) was intended to outlaw boycott rules just like 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.234" offset="7936293">Now, of course 8 (e) was intended to complement 8 (b) (4) (B).</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.227" offset="7956250">This Court's decision in Sand Door pointed out that a boycott agreement although not a defense, although a -- a defense in an 8 (b) (4) (B) case was lawful in itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.300" offset="8012570">Now, the Congress faced with this decision, concluded that agreements to boycott like consummated boycotts should be outlawed as against public policy and they did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.533" offset="8061471">Now, the legislative history has reviewed in our brief at pages 19 to 35, on the brief of the Associate General Contractors 50 to 59.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.221" offset="8096266">And I'd like to comment on only a few significant features of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.518" offset="8113403">First, the Board's contention that the legislative references to Teamsters 'hot cargo' agreements, evidences an intent to exclude other forms of boycott agreements, just was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.733" offset="8170350">Now, here's what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.355" offset="8176828">The original Kennedy-Ives Bill, which was introduced in January 1959, contained only labor reform.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.068" offset="8207653">The Taft-Hartley proponents wanted to get in amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.753" offset="8230431">Now, to get on to this reformed legislative bandwagon so to speak, they had to have our whipping boy and they picked out the Teamsters Union on 'hot cargo'.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.701" offset="8266167">And they succeeded in the Senate in getting an amendment which may ban boycott agreements in the transportation industry and they tried to expand that there but they failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.147" offset="8311933">In the House, however, they broadened this to include a prohibition against agreements to boycott by all employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.347" offset="8352789">And the after the conference accept this as the breadth, breadth of this new provision, Senator Kennedy himself explained it as follows and I refer to our brief 111 of page 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.467" offset="8401272">The Landrum-Griffin bill extended the 'hot cargo' provisions of the Senate bill which we applied only the Teamsters to all agreements between an employer and the labor union by which the employer agrees not to do business with another concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.529" offset="8461458">So after broadening, 'hot cargo' became synonymous with an agreement to boycott the products of other employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.567" offset="8493641">Now, the second feature of the Act, of the legislative history, from January 28 until September 3rd, every admin -- every Landrum-Griffin bill that was introduced and there were lot of them, contained in Section 8 (b) (4) (B) itself, a proscription against an agreement to boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.272" offset="8592488">In other words, it necessarily had to be as broad as the section itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.807" offset="8614640">Now, this provision was dropped from 8 (b) (4) (B) in conference September 3rd.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.609" offset="8633762">Only after the conferees were satisfied and said, they were satisfied that 8 (e) was as broad as the 8 (b) provision had been, and we've covered this at page 25 on our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.173" offset="8684022">Now third, all of the opponents of 8 (e) in the Congress, clearly understood the broad sweep of the section and reportedly said so, our brief at 27 to 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.934" offset="8739088">Now, after pleading for the same justifiable boycotts as they had in 1947, they accepted the broad scope of 8 (e) with only two exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.586" offset="8785690">The limited one for the construction industry I referred to and the broad one for the apparel industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="3591.855" offset="14470771">Now, our differences here of course stem from the fact that we view the basic reach and thrust of the two provisions differently and we are also in disagreement as to the character of the agreement that is involved in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.858" offset="14530853">Now, basically Mr. Mahin's argument it seems to me seems to come down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.729" offset="14558333">That the 80th Congress which adopted Section 8 (b) (4) (A) which is now Section 8 (b) (4) (B) of the current -- of the sta -- of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.578" offset="14597726">At the 80th Congress here prohibited all refusals, all employee refusals by employee to handle or use the products of another employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.202" offset="14636178">And with these premises of foundation, the argument concludes that the 86th Congress in 1959 which was bent on foreclosing loopholes in the statute certainly does not intend to create anything were non-existent and that it did not intend to permit a circumvention, a circumvention of the prohibition against secondary boycotts by agreements which would require an employer to cease doing business with another or to refrain from using these projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.659" offset="14745997">Now, I want to address myself initially to the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.637" offset="14761880">The argument that Section 8 (b) (4) (B) bans all employer refusals to handle the products of another employer and that therefore, when the Union directed the employees of Frouge not to handle the pre-fitted doors it committed a violation of Section 8 (b) (4) (B).</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.756" offset="14830425">The weakness of the argument, the weakness of the argument is that it places an unwarranted reliance upon the literal language of Section 8 (b) (4) (B), an approach which this Court rejected in 1951 in the International Rice Milling and rejected again in General Electric case in 1961, and if that approach were to be followed, it would mean that primary strike activity which necessarily tends to disrupt the activity -- they have been to these relations of the struck employer that primary struck -- strike activity would be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.569" offset="14957693">But this Court on of at least two occasions has refused to countenance that kind of an approach of the statute and in addition to that, Congress in 1959 when it added the primary, secondary proviso to the 8 (b) (4) (B) provision of the Act unmistakably, unmistakably precluded such a reading of Section 8 (b) (4) (B).</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.242" offset="15044315">Now, in the Denver Building case which has won the first cases that came here after the Taft-Hartley, this Court told us that the congressional policy which is embedded, which is embedded in Section 8 (b) (4) (B) is the dual congressional policy of preserving to the employees the right to exert pressure upon in offending employer and to be involved in a primary dispute and of shielding, shielding and not offending employer from pressures and controversies not his own.</text>

            <text syncTime="3777.252" offset="15212335">Now, Section 8 (b) (4) (B) as this Court has said and again on two occasions and as the legislative history of the 194 -- 1947 Amendments unmistakably indicates, was directed on what it is called the secondary boycott again in the language of this Court who sanctions bear not upon the offending employer who is -- who alone is involved in the dispute but upon some third party who has no concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.621" offset="15325811">The practice against which 8 (b) (4) (B) was directed as the conference report on the Taft-Hartley amendments makes clear, was the practice of a union calling a strike or engaging in a work stoppage at employer A, in order to compel employer A to cease doing business with employer B who is either non-union, was involved in a labor dispute or was disfavored for some other reason by -- by the union.</text>
