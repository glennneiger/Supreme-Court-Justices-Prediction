            <text syncTime="14.128" offset="159848">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.846" offset="170715">I'd like to begin if I may by trying to answer two questions, which I did an inadequate job with yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.609" offset="201853">Mr. Justice Fortas asked, first of all concerning the review provided like it within the service and within the Justice Department of hearing examiner determinations in these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.388" offset="256920">Limiting myself to naturalization proceedings, I understand that there is a procedure for review within the immigration service.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.272" offset="296417">In this case for example, the hearing examiner's determination was reviewed in that District Office and then by a Regional Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.952" offset="331212">There is no provision for -- and more general review outside the service except as to peculiar or particular rulings of law which might come from the Office of Legal Counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.574" offset="381680">I did point out that Section 335 (d) of the Act provide that in all events even if disapproved by a superiors, the hearing examiner's report was go to the District Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.346" offset="432776">On the other hand, it is not binding on the District Judge in any sense and as the District Judge here said, he disregarded both the findings and these -- and the conclusions of law completely.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="96.367" offset="488887">If the Government's position is sustained in this case, is this man said -- the deportation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_s_rifkind" startTime="102.841" stopTime="155.628">
            <label>Mr. Robert S. Rifkind</label>
            <text syncTime="102.841" offset="514696">I think not Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.624" offset="525876">It seems to me that only two conceivable grounds for deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.975" offset="547297">One is that he was at some time a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.996" offset="563388">The other is that he gave false testimonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.340" offset="576763">As to the former, it seems to me clear that the Government's own evidence showed that his membership was not of the meaningful variety that would serve as a basis for deportation and probably wasn't even of this sort of the voluntary variety that would serve as a basis for exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.999" offset="667355">As to the misrepresentation, he would of course have the benefit of Section 241 (f) which forgives that sort of thing, you have that before you in the Erika case.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.004" offset="711346">So I think there is no basis for deportation here.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="155.628" offset="725870">Is he foreclosed from another application for natural -- for citizenship?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert S. Rifkind</label>
            <text syncTime="159.676" offset="742066">Certainly not.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.469" offset="745200">Indeed, he is now entitled to apply as the spouse of an American citizen since his wife was admitted to citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.018" offset="779473">The period involved there is a three-year period after her admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.006" offset="803401">They need only show good moral character for that three-year period and his time in that regard would be up in about 15 months from now.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.507" offset="845406">So it's a very short-term proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.290" offset="860557">One other thing I might mention also bearing on this general problem of review within the Justice Department and the Immigration Service is that about a hundred thousand persons are naturalized each year, at least that was the figure in the last report of the attorney general for 60 -- 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.158" offset="935999">Of those petitions were withdrawn and some 1800 cases and there was a litigated question and some 150 questions -- cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.545" offset="981556">So that there's quite a substantial problem as far as reviewing the details of each cases in administrative manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.243" offset="1020322">I also think that those figures tend to stress the importance of the system of self-disclosure of self-reporting that the Immigration Law depends on.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.339" offset="1064730">It's rather like the Internal Revenue Law in many senses.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.477" offset="1085315">It is largely the initial application that the petitioner files in which he answers a variety of questions which were designed by regulations, the Attorney General was authorized to issue --</text>

            <text syncTime="1340.300" offset="5464586">It seems to me that the traditional view and the statutory view the doubts are to be resolved against the petitioner on the naturalization side is a desirable logical relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="1479.501" offset="6021413">Then he goes on the say that he did not in fact know where the petitioner was a member or whether he was a nonmember who had been invited to attend.</text>
