            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 49, United Gas Pipe Line Company, petitioner, versus Federal Power Commission, et al. Mr. Woods.</text>

            <label>Mr. Vernon W. Woods</label>
            <text syncTime="29.901" offset="222960">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.891" offset="238947">The petitioner in this case, United Gas Pipe Line Company is a natural gas company is engaged in the business of purchasing gas from producers in the field, transporting that gas through pipe lines and then selling it to distributors for resale and to industry directly for there own use.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.823" offset="326614">This case arises out of the Natural Gas Act and it grows out of an order issued by the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.559" offset="361618">That order for the first time in the history of the Natural Gas Act in this 38 and this is an Act of 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.958" offset="395160">For the first time in the history of the Act, the Federal Power Commission has assumed they had power to order a pipe line to purchase gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.356" offset="432776">Moreover, to pay a price fixed unilaterally by the seller and finally to purchase quantities in volumes consistent with the cancelled contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.467" offset="481259">Our petition for writ of certiorari posed two questions, whether the Federal Power Commission in fact had a power, authority to order a pipe line without its consent to continue purchasing gas after the producer had cancelled the contract in which a pipe line had been buying gas whether it had authority to order the pipe line to pay the unilaterally increased price fixed by the seller for that gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.824" offset="586689">The second question being that if the Act have -- that in it which permits the Commission to issue such an order then is the Act to that extent unconstitutional as violative for the due process requirements just compensation required by the Fifth Amendment to the constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.030" offset="663489">The facts are undisputed and can be stated briefly and they're important to this petition to show the problem that it is faced with by the Commission's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.378" offset="704867">In January 1953, United and Continental Oil Company entered into a contract under the terms in which Continental agreed to sell and United agreed to buy gas produced by Continental Oil Company in the junction Bayou Field.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.839" offset="770696">The junction Bayou Field is located in Cameron Parish which is right in the southwest corner of Louisiana next to the Texas boundary or border.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.457" offset="801207">A contract of a ten year primary term with the provision that it would automatically continue in effect after expiration of the primary term provided that either party could cancel the contract upon 90 days prior written notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.883" offset="854915">The contract also provided fixed prices to be paid for the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.416" offset="872991">Two prices, the one in effect at the end of the primary term.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.328" offset="884694">That is the second 5 year period of the contract was 10.79 cents per MCF inclusive of tax reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.649" offset="917922">In other words, United Gas Line Company was paying Continental 10.79 cents per MCF as the contract was nearing the end of its primary term.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.688" offset="954075">Now, this contract would've continued automatically in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.735" offset="966301">But for the fact, the Continental Oil Company some 90 days prior to the expiration of the primary term wrote to United and said, We cancel the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.263" offset="1008410">And United accepted the letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.367" offset="1016874">It was canceled on the terms of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.509" offset="1029413">Thereafter United rather Continental came to United and said, We'd like to negotiate with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.596" offset="1053759">We'd like to enter to a new contract covering the injunction, Bayou Field gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.521" offset="1069432">And it is ,Fine, let's talk about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.893" offset="1078941">Continental said in substance that we want to increase the price by our standards, United standards substantially.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.813" offset="1106631">They ordered the price to go up to approximately 18 cents in MCF.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.386" offset="1120946">That is over the whole term of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.290" offset="1128573">They would've started a little less than that about 15.75.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.712" offset="1142262">But they had something else in there that was completely unacceptable to United.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.395" offset="1156995">They said that, We wanted to remain open-ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.075" offset="1167653">With the idea in mind that you will agree contractually that if the Federal Power Commission will permit a higher price or different -- a higher price and that to which we've agreed contractually in the so-called area rate proceeding, that we may charge that rate and you must pay it.</text>

            <text syncTime="295.794" offset="1286562">As I appreciated the Federal Power Commission contemplates that it would enter an order stating that all gas sold in South Louisiana will be sold at a specific price, 18.50 cents, that is as an initial rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.463" offset="1333269">I think that they probably contemplate that gas which is defined as all gas would be sold at a lesser rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="502.562" offset="2113599">First of all when Continental undertook to sell us his gas, actually the Philips case, it came to the Federal Power Commission to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing it to sell the gas to United.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.378" offset="2168874">United also when it undertook to buy this gas out at the injunction Bayou Field it had an existence, a pipeline, it ran from the southwest corner of Louisiana over into Texas and this gas is located close to that pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.238" offset="2220283">We had to build certain minimal facilities to receive this gas into our system.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.182" offset="2240136">Meter station and tubing that came into our line and we asked the Federal Power Commission for a certificate authorizing us to construct and operate those facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.244" offset="2280364">We also received an authorization to move this gas and to transport in into state commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.521" offset="2309413">Now, at the time the Federal Power Commission accepted the increase rate filed unilaterally by Continental which was the rate they demanded of us and which weren't willing to read to contractually.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.959" offset="2363225">The Commission advised upon Continental's request that it would be come effective at the end of the primary term of the contract which was January 31, 1963, the date that Continental had made its cancellation effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.789" offset="2418500">United did not then accept any gas from Continental after that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.155" offset="2440025">It did not do so because it did not wish to pay that price for the gas and because he believed that the bargaining processes were left intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.628" offset="2469909">If he weren't forced to buy this gas, that they could bargain with Continental and then forget the gas in his judgment and price it though as appropriate and proper for sale in the Beaumont area where this gas in actually transported.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.912" offset="2515048">Now in that connection, United sells gas in the southeast part of Texas around Beaumont where it takes this gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.885" offset="2542947">Its sells are not only to city gates, that is to distributors for resale in the city of Beaumont but it sells a very great quantities of gas directly to industries and on the only and the only way you can sell it of course is by contract and it sells there at contractually fixed rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.419" offset="2609089">Now in addition to that fact United is faced in this area as it is in the whole of South Texas and South Louisiana, the very active and very strenuous competition for its markets is faced with competition by intrastate suppliers who are willing to sell their gas directly to industries or to town borders often times at prices cheaper than the Federal Power Commission had itself reflected in its approval of rates and so fort filed by independent producers such as Continental.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.876" offset="2738866">So United is -- the point is that we are faced there with very active competition, the Federal Power Commission has itself ruled in a case involving United that it cannot protect United selling gas to even a city gate, that that is a distributor for resale from intrastate competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.774" offset="2814516">It said to United that the Federal Power Commission's jurisdiction extends only to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.617" offset="2837817">If there's intrastate commerce that you must compete with then you must take care of yourself.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.735" offset="2858297">Now the point of it is that in the structure of the Act, United Gas Pipe Line Company as a pipe line sells gas by contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.530" offset="2893511">That's the only way it can sell gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.170" offset="2904064">It has to compete with other suppliers and it has to compete with other fuels and it has to sell gas to industries for example on the basis of contractually fixed rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.876" offset="2950875">Now that is the way the Act is designed and that's the scheme of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.916" offset="2967071">And in order to do that United must determine what it can afford to pay for gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.523" offset="2985462">It's not here so much concern with the fact that the Federal Power Commission may view Continental 15.75 cents which it filled as fair and reasonable from Continental's point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.418" offset="3025063">That is not our concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.118" offset="3031855">Our concern is that we must buy gas that we can sell in competition in Southwest Texas and still make a profit and we must buy gas at a price that we can sell under contractually fixed rate and still make a profit and that we under the Act are the only one that determine that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.422" offset="3093086">The Commission has no authority to do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="922.177" offset="3792123">United thinks that the Commission was never intended that the Natural Gas Act to have power to do what its done in this order that is to order the purchasing of gas are the acceptance of a rate filed unilaterally by the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.386" offset="3852936">Now we think that's true for basically for the reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.353" offset="3868818">First of all the Act very clearly does not include and encompass and bring within the Commission's jurisdiction that purchasing of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.403" offset="3904972">Secondly, the Act quite clearly provides that Act -- that rates had to be fixed by a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.190" offset="3932139">That is that the Commission itself does not fix rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.223" offset="3948231">That natural gas companies fix rates and file them and they're reviewed by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.723" offset="3966307">And that the Commission has no authority to do what is done here and that is to force the natural gas company to accept any rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.372" offset="4004864">That unless a consent is given first to the natural gas company to accept the rate which it can be reviewed by Commission that the Commission itself have no authority to supply that agreement to a rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.759" offset="4046451">Thirdly, we think under the scheme of the Act, the detrimental effects have opened this to United Gas Pipe Line Company illustrate that the Act was never intended to place a company in a position were it had to buy gas or had to pay a particular rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.358" offset="4104756">Because of the fact that the company itself sells the gas under contraction arrangements and it is only under those circumstances that he can sell gas and that the Commission has no authority to increase his own sales rate that is the company's sales rates in order to recover to that company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.209" offset="4172257">The increase calls to -- are forced upon it by unilaterally increased rates by the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.530" offset="4193468">Now, let me fix the first proposition and that is that the Natural Gas Act does not include the purchasing of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.875" offset="4226905">The scope of the Natural Gas Act is defined by Section 1 (b) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.436" offset="4249161">And Section 1 (b) says that the Act extends to the transportation and sale of natural gas in interstate commerce and that the companies engage in such transportation and sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.873" offset="4294823">For emphasis I think it's appropriate to point out that the Government here concedes that Section 1 (b) does not include purchasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.135" offset="4327946">Page 5 of its brief in opposition for the writ of certiorari, the Government says, Although Section 1 (b) does not explicitly bring within the Commission's regulatory power the purchase of natural gas, it does give the Commission authority over the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.452" offset="4397223">The Government has conceded what is obvious and that is that this Act was not designed to regulate the purchasing or the procurement of natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.333" offset="4436720">We think that the legislative history establishes that Congress adopted an Act that it knew did not include or extend the Commission's jurisdiction to the purchasing or procurement of natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.822" offset="4482696">This is true because in January -- in July 1937 at the time the Natural Gas Act was being considered by Congress there was -- it introduced into Congress a Bill in both Houses, it's in the Bill 1717 or 1919 which would have given the Commission jurisdiction over the procurement or purchasing of natural gas by pipe lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.293" offset="4576528">Now, that bill was not adopted that is itself clearly reflects the fact that Congress rejected the type of thing that the Commission is undertaking here to say is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.863" offset="4630862">Congress did not intend to give the Commission power to make a common purchase so to speak out of a pipe line, are to require to purchase gas other than on a contractual basis consistent with the legislative history and with the wording of Section 1 (b) of the Act which does not include purchasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.820" offset="4702647">Those Sections of the Act on which Commission here relies, the certificate Section of the Act does not authorize the Commission to issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity to purchase gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.613" offset="4749876">The Commission has never issued such a certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.766" offset="4762415">Consistent therewith Section 7 (b) which is the abandonment Section of the Act does not authorize the Commission to issue an abandonment to stop purchasing gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.872" offset="4806823">The word purchasing doesn't appear in either of those two Sections at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2512.386" offset="10152939">This was a question which was presented to the Commission Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.535" offset="10173524">It was not a question presented to this Court in the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.361" offset="10196825">The question as I understand it that has been raised by petitioner is notwithstanding the fact that there hasn't been an abandonment of facilities and services that the Commission can't exercised that jurisdiction because there is an implied exception because this would effect purchasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.634" offset="10289925">I think this is the only real issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.742" offset="10318346">There is also no issue in this case as to whether the Commission in the circumstances here described should have allowed an abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.352" offset="10376756">United talks about the fact that it didn't need the gas and that the price was too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.511" offset="10397445">But United has never availed itself of the opportunity to seek abandonment juris -- abandonment approval from the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.992" offset="10447391">In the Commission in determining that United had to seek abandonment approval from the Commission also said that they were free at any time to request such authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.804" offset="10506637">But at no time have they done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.641" offset="10529938">The -- I would like to mention also really the preliminary matter that the reasonableness of Continental's rate is not at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.312" offset="10572570">It is true that there was an increase, a determination of the contract from about 10 and three quarter cents to about 15 and three quarter cent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.486" offset="10609351">The Commission did -- permitted this rate to go into effect without suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.496" offset="10629308">United never challenged the reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.168" offset="10640071">The particular level is the -- below the level at which the Commission under its policy statement will suspend increased rates and in the pending South Louisiana area rate case, no party has suggested that the just and reasonable area rate is any less than this 15 and 3 quarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.989" offset="10763368">In fact, all the recommendations are above that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.884" offset="10778937">The staff of the Commission in attempting to -- and I presume properly so attempting to follow the Commission's decision in the Permian Basin Area Rate Case has recommended a area rate of 18 cents which is about more than 2 cents above the rate involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.474" offset="10865246">So, that does not present a real question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.967" offset="10891264">Instead what United is arguing is that the Commission's jurisdiction over sales and transportation and its abandonment authority has to be read narrowly because the word purchasing does not appear anywhere in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.990" offset="10983320">Now, this we believe is quite inconsistent with what this Court had held in case after case that the Natural Gas Act was intended to provide a comprehensive regulatory system over natural gas companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.228" offset="11052283">The -- there are exceptions written into the Act and I would respect the production and gathering and with respect to local sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.796" offset="11094601">And -- but these exceptions don't mean that the gas companies are not subject to regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.238" offset="11124276">It means rather that in those particular spheres of interest, they are subject to regulation by the states rather than by the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.396" offset="11160952">But in this case, even though in the situation where the court was reading the affirmative grant of jurisdiction over sales and transportation in relation -- or I should say -- this Court has read the Commission's affirmative jurisdiction over sales and transportation in relation to production and gathering as meaning that you have to give primary effect to the affirmative grant of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.911" offset="11307029">Of course that was the holding of the first Phillips case in which the court said that the Power Commission does have jurisdiction over independent producers notwithstanding and expressed exception over production and gathering.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.013" offset="11367424">Here, without any such expressed exception, United is asking that the Commission's jurisdiction be severely limited.</text>

            <text syncTime="2896.853" offset="11690820">The Commission has -- as its opinion points out has frequently held that abandonment does not depend upon the removal of facilities from the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.037" offset="11735542">That abandonment can result simply by turning off a valve as well as by physical removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.831" offset="11758738">In addition to that -- in this case the Commission found that there was an abandonment of the services which United is rendering by means of the facility.</text>
