            <label>Mr. Howard J. Trienens</label>
            <text syncTime="81.226" offset="428283">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.635" offset="437896">My name is Howard Trienens.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.124" offset="447822">This is the Penn-Central merger case.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.023" offset="455450">It's probably the biggest corporate merger ever.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.638" offset="469974">The cases before this Court on appeals from a judgment of the District Court denying injunctive relief against an order of Interstate Commerce Commission which would permit immediate consummation of the Penn-Central merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.490" offset="517308">I stress immediate because by the very nature of the Commission's action this case was decided by the District Court on the lawfulness of the Commission's order and on appeal, the lawfulness of the Commission's order permitting immediate consummation was necessarily before the Court even though the matter arose on applications for interlocutory injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.203" offset="604139">Now, basically this case arose under Section 5 (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.032" offset="623470">And that Act enabled the Commission to approve an exempt from the Antitrust laws, merger transactions which are found to be as conditioned by the Commission or found to be consistent with the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.422" offset="685014">The problem here and the problem I will develop through these rather laborious facts is that no one can know today whether this merger transaction as conditioned is or is not consistent with the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.458" offset="737155">And the reason you can't know is because you don't know the conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.673" offset="750111">You don't know what kind of a transaction this is yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.235" offset="768293">The Commission has found that certain conditions are essential that the certain conditions must be attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.490" offset="789295">They have not been found either for the long term or the short term.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.862" offset="810820">Now realistically, we believe that until those conditions are found and passed upon no one can know what the future of competitive rail transportation in the East will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.267" offset="856482">On stating the facts, the first and dominant fact is the Penn and Central today had half the railroad business in the East.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.806" offset="894621">The figures are set forth in our brief and inserted in the end of our brief a series of maps showing the proposed Penn-Central system and showing the remaining roads and the question that has dominated the Commission proceedings, the question before this Court is how the other half of the East is going to live in the face of Penn-Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.527" offset="985527">Of the hearings before the Commission, Penn and Central showed that they would create a territory-wide single line service serving all major ports, all major gateways and as a single line railroad throughout the East they would provide great operative savings and great improvements in service.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.997" offset="1063372">A single line service has great advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.215" offset="1076224">Single line service saves money but it also improved service.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.818" offset="1094614">And the Commission relying on those improvements in service and efficiencies found at this merger was in the public interest notwithstanding the diminution of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.690" offset="1134111">But these very same service improvements are the things that caused the problem for the other eastern roads and raised the questions of how they are going to live in the face of this Penn-Central system.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.196" offset="1184162">Now, following the hearings before the Commission, the examiners found that these improvements would occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.184" offset="1212061">They also found that the merger was necessary because of the survival, save and enable to survive the Penn and Central companies because of the failing company doctrine specifically in those terms, the East was a failing industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.132" offset="1271933">Now the examiners recognized that when you put Penn and Central together they would cause shifts in the traffic patterns.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.850" offset="1298787">They would attract traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.918" offset="1303071">But the examiners felt and found that the other half of these could live because by cooperating among themselves they could attract and meet Penn-Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.908" offset="1355003">Now with the other half of the East by working together could offset these shifts in traffic that would attract traffic to Penn-Central.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.193" offset="1544129">Now, the important point and it's expressed greatly by the counsel for the Commission in their brief at page 48 where they find or state that B &amp; O-C &amp; O was permitted to go ahead on a specific finding that it would not have any adverse effect on any other eastern railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.339" offset="1636707">N &amp; W-Nickel Plate was permitted to go ahead as Commission counsel frankly state because it would have no material adverse effect on any other railroad in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.462" offset="1677249">And in fact, in N &amp; W-Nickel Plate they found that that merger would help of the railroads and yet to bear in mind that putting together N &amp; W-Nickel Plate for example, put together a railroad almost as big but not quite as big as Penn alone already was.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.166" offset="1736077">That's why with its rather narrower geographic cover, it didn't raise the problems the Penn-Central raises.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.763" offset="1770454">Now that -- the end of the hearing stage, after the hearing stage that Norfolk and Western which had been enabled the merger with Nickel Plate was set free as a part of that merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.624" offset="1821863">It was set free of control of the Pennsylvania Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.285" offset="1832521">Up to that point, Pennsylvania controlled N &amp; W.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.863" offset="1842866">What N &amp; W is today, Penn-Central wield it.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.060" offset="1855613">It was part of the three-system plan, part of the Penn-Central's plan for how to carve up the East.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.632" offset="1877870">And it was after the hearing stage, after the examiner had found that the way to meet Penn-Central's for the other half to get together that N &amp; W and C &amp; O proposed that there be hearings as to whether a merger was the way they should get together.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.937" offset="1935130">That proposal -- application has been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.013" offset="1947460">The hearings been held up for a year or so but it's now been set for this winter, this spring.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.606" offset="1973791">Oh, by the time this case reached the Commission level, this was a very different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.236" offset="1996361">The survival problem, the failing company doctrine was out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.145" offset="2011930">Penn-Central which between them had earned $7 million in 1961, that earned $122 million in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.343" offset="2040769">In 1966, their estimate is $150 million of net income and that's before reflecting any merger savings or other merger benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="597.808" offset="2494568">Well, the Penn and Central aren't in taxes so it's no difference to them at the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.934" offset="2519124">Now, the Commission as I say did not rely on this survival problem, this failing company doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.506" offset="2541380">The Commission recognized that these service improvements would occur that it was a good thing to have railroad earnings at a higher level.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.381" offset="2572936">And they approved the merger as outweighing the diminution of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.357" offset="2592789">Now, with respect to three railroads however, the Commission found that this Penn-Central merger would destroy them.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.677" offset="2622046">This is what distinguishes Penn-Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.383" offset="2628942">We have a finding that this merger would destroy at least three of the railroads not coming to New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.062" offset="2651617">I like to read two sentences that are the key for the Commission's analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.290" offset="2668544">They first found that unless somehow protected these three railroads would be adversely affected by the proposed merger to a serious degree and would be severely handicapped in providing the required transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.319" offset="2728626">Now the Commission then concluded that it is doubtful that without inclusion in a major system, these three carriers could withstand the competition of the applicant's merge.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.702" offset="2774183">And unless they are protected during the period necessary to determine their future, we would not authorize consummation at this time even though approving the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.586" offset="2821726">Nor was the Commission drew the line between when you authorized consummation and approval of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.478" offset="2849311">And they found that we will let Penn-Central go ahead right away even though we haven't found a home for these railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.556" offset="2877628">And why because we have worked out some specific traffic and indemnity conditions and they further set our approval for merger, for underlayed consummation shall be subject to the conditions specifically determined by us.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.834" offset="2950666">However, now we're -- they said we're going to let it go through before we found the home for these roads but we're going to work out something in the interim and are letting it -- this merger go through now is subject to those specific protected conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.532" offset="3005524">Now, what were those conditions?</text>
            <text syncTime="726.662" offset="3010017">There are two kinds, one of the traffic conditions which were designed to freeze and tie up Penn-Central in their actual improvement of service so if they just couldn't improve service and couldn't attract traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.558" offset="3061635">Now that doesn't do the job even if you froze Penn-Central solid, that doesn't do the job because the very fact of putting them together eliminating competition between them causes a diversion of traffic from these other railroads so -- and the Commission didn't stop with the traffic conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.525" offset="3125478">It went on to these so-called indemnity conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.131" offset="3139897">Indemnity conditions and that's a misnomer.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.233" offset="3148257">These aren't indemnities for loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.831" offset="3154735">This is a revenue sharing pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.562" offset="3161631">There's a formula where you put Penn and Central and Erie's money together and they get earnings out of it as a share of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.059" offset="3187649">Erie is guaranteed share.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.404" offset="3201024">Now, these conditions were critical to the Commission's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.220" offset="3216280">They were noble.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.013" offset="3219414">Nobody had ever heard of them before, there was no hearing on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.423" offset="3233102">They came out of the blue.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.961" offset="3247208">Well after this Commission hearing, the protected carriers, these three protected carriers, they asked for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.040" offset="3275525">They asked reconsideration on the grounds that these conditions were wholly inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.555" offset="3293602">The unprotected carriers who'd been counting on the cooperation of everybody outside Penn-Central were suddenly for -- faced with the problem that there was a pool, a community of interest created where three of these roads were going to be open to Penn-Central orbit at least temporarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.410" offset="3360998">So both the protected and the unprotected carriers asked for reconsiderations.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.060" offset="3383568">The appellants, Chicago and Eastern Illinois also asked for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.490" offset="3405302">The Commission had dismissed its claim on the ground that, "Oh well, C &amp; E I will have an offsetting benefit of intensified competition between its connecting carriers in Penn, one of the connecting carriers being Erie.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.159" offset="3455979">There's no recognition of the effect of this revenue pool on what happens to Erie's competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.653" offset="3485968">Now, C &amp; E I, the Commission also passed off its problem by saying, "Oh, C &amp; E I can provide superior service in that area".</text>
            <text syncTime="853.485" offset="3517315">No evidence to support that nor there is any evidence that a possible control of another railroad of C &amp; E I would have anything to do with the impact to Penn-Central on C &amp; E I.</text>

            <text syncTime="884.928" offset="3643120">Because that report undercut the whole premise of the basis on which they left the merger consummated immediately in April.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.201" offset="3680214">The Commission first acknowledged the valid issues that have been raised with respect to these new conditions and they acknowledged further that as to the unprotected carriers they never had a hearing on its -- from the impact of these conditions on them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1259.197" offset="5140146">Either this case nor Penn-Central can be fully understood, its consideration of one is divorced from the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="1279.237" offset="5220289">Commissioner Webb looked at Penn-Central ad said, what are the alternatives?</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.834" offset="5238680">Alternative one, Boston and Maine for example as an independent railroad, that's out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1662.481" offset="6753259">The reason I said that and I'll quote one more sentence from the -- Commissioner Webb's analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.468" offset="6769246">An important fact is that the inability of Erie, D &amp; H and D &amp; M to survive as an independent carrier is not a direct consequence of C &amp; O or B &amp; O or Nickel Plate and Wabash but is a direct and inevitable result of what Penn-Central will do to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.983" offset="6839254">That's why the fuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.069" offset="6843643">That's why we're here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.060" offset="6847613">It's what Penn-Central will do to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.321" offset="6860675">And that's what the Commission found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.741" offset="6866317">I'm not here arguing that the Commission should have found it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.110" offset="6875826">I'm saying as a fact the Commission did find them and that's what we start with and that's why we are in the box and that's why all these ramifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.597" offset="6917726">Now, there's one other critical issue that was left wide open by the Commission and that's this problem of whether Penn-Central should be required to pay what's called the capital indemnity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.730" offset="6962343">Now, this is important because it may be the key, the Penn-Central pays some capital indemnity may be the key to enabling the Commission to put Erie and D &amp; H in N &amp; W.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.880" offset="7014902">In fact, Commissioner Webb said that if you reflected the losses Penn-Central would impose on Erie and D &amp; H in the value of those two roads in N &amp; W, it will not be possible to construct equitable terms unless Erie or N &amp; W receive capital loss indemnification from Penn-Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.257" offset="7088358">So that may be the key to getting Erie and D &amp; H.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.086" offset="7099747">And how was that left?</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.147" offset="7103927">That's left wide open.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.793" offset="7110510">The -- Central is arguing that the Commission has no power even to impose it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.087" offset="7127751">The Commission or the Central has left -- reserved the right of judicial reviews to that power so this key to putting even Erie and D &amp; H might be the key to putting them in N &amp; W and saving them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.713" offset="7178219">That's left wide open until these conditions are decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.501" offset="7193370">And the only way to do that is now decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.085" offset="7207685">Well why didn't the Commission finish its task under 5 (2)?</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.595" offset="7221791">Why is all this left wide open?</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.017" offset="7227434">There must be some compelling reason, what is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.769" offset="7242480">We have a discussion to that on the Commission's September 16th report?</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.826" offset="7262647">The Commission dealt first with this problem, should we wait or we find a home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.920" offset="7275081">Should we defer consummation until we find a home and they said, "No, that might take several years and it would delay the savings of over $80 million a year that Penn-Central would produce".</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.996" offset="7323355">Now, you get it -- an impression from reading Commission's report that if you put Penn-Central in immediately great savings will flow, great benefits will flow, great service improvements will flow but there's a trick to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.744" offset="7374346">And the trick is you got to level on the question of under what circumstances would Penn-Central go into effect tomorrow if you let it go and that's because of these traffic conditions again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.246" offset="7416351">They'd go in subject to these traffic conditions and they would be tied up as to what they could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.864" offset="7442787">It wouldn't stop them from hurting other railroads because -- just put them together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.685" offset="7458147">The diminution of competition would hurt other railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.134" offset="7467865">But they would be stopped from improving service and saving money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.777" offset="7486464">Now, is this my idea, my interpretation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.140" offset="7499943">No, this is the interpretation of the Pennsylvania's vice president of traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.354" offset="7516766">He said if you put this merger through subject to the conditions, these traffic conditions that would go into effect, we'd be so tied up that it would deprive the shipping public of any improved service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.486" offset="7569324">There is no chance of any substantial savings in the next two years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1887.996" offset="7655320">That's what its all coming down to because there isn't any service improvement while these conditions are in effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1898.512" offset="7697429">And even if there were any savings, you've got to get over the idea of these promises that it would be reflected in lower rates because the Penn vice president cannot conceive of that happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.262" offset="7736404">So there's nothing in this for the public in terms of savings, service or rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1941.112" offset="7867852">Now, we put in some evidence which we've attached to our reply brief by a Dr. Baker (ph), Professor of Economics at Yale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.040" offset="7895542">He shows that these very conditions would have further additional anticompetitive effects as market sharing and revenue sharing devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.886" offset="7930964">Now, the Commission has never weighed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.209" offset="7940159">It admitted that it never had the hearing on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1962.867" offset="7954892">So there has been no weighing and balancing of what this does, the competition through these conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2831.686" offset="11430118">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.333" offset="11444746">I have been allotted ten minutes to present to you the unique position of the Central Railroad of New Jersey, one of the appellant railroads, the Number 642.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.010" offset="11495424">C &amp; J is a relatively small railroad but it is an important one and there are those who depend upon it even though they might not love it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.193" offset="11544116">It carries 18% of all the railway freight tonnage originating or terminating in the Port of New York area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.301" offset="11588524">And it's second only in this respect only to the Pennsylvania and its affiliates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.189" offset="11620080">C &amp; J believes that it will be unable to survive the impact of Penn-Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.427" offset="11649128">In this respect, its position is identical to that of E-L, D &amp; H and B &amp; M, I'm really sorry for all of these initials, which have been referred to as the three protected roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.246" offset="11708374">But unlike the three protected roads, C &amp; J has been unable to obtain a hearing before the Commission as to how seriously it will be injured by a merge to Penn-Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.379" offset="11764903">As a result, the Commission has made no finding as to the ability of C &amp; J to survive Penn-Central and it has made no provision looking toward the inclusion of C &amp; J in any other major system or for protecting it in some way during the interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.698" offset="11850167">And C &amp; J has been asking so far without success that only that it be given such a hearing before Penn-Central is allowed to consummate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.523" offset="11893426">Under this Court's opinion in McLean Trucking there can be no doubt as to the Commission's duty before approving a merger as large as Penn-Central to consider its effect on other competing Eastern railroads and in fact the Commission expressly recognizes this obligation in its original report in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.566" offset="11981615">Nor is there any dispute as to the failure of the Commission to consider the effect of Penn-Central on C &amp; J.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.309" offset="12020590">Indeed the Commission in its report on reconsideration made an expressed finding that there had been no showing of record on this point one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.984" offset="12071267">For the past two and a half years, C &amp; J has been trying to present evidence to the Commission showing that continuation to -- of its service is essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.728" offset="12114317">That it will probably be unable to survive Penn-Central and that it should be protected from the impact of Penn-Central, pending its inclusion in some other railroad in the same way that the Commission intends to protect the three protected roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.002" offset="12179414">But the Commission has turned all of these efforts aside either on the ground that they are too late because it has found C &amp; J guilty of latches or on the grounds that they are too early and that C &amp; J will be given an opportunity in some other proceeding at some other time after Penn-Central has been consummated to obtain the protection it needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.758" offset="12278366">There are two reasons why the period of latches does not stand up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.696" offset="12298115">First, it doesn't fit the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.554" offset="12313579">It's true that C &amp; J did not take part in the first round of hearings which terminated on October 2nd of 1963.</text>

            <text syncTime="3065.719" offset="12366242">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.620" offset="12369899">The N &amp; W, C &amp; O, B &amp; O merger plan contemplates the inclusion of C &amp; J and C &amp; J has petitioned for an inclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.264" offset="12400410">And that's the only proposal to date that would take care of C &amp; J.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.364" offset="12428831">After the original -- during the original hearings Penn and Central were vigorously opposing the inclusion of the New Haven the point that was going to cause the most injury to C &amp; J because the New Haven is one of C &amp; J's major interchange partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.126" offset="12503855">But in June of 1964 after the hearings -- at the first days of the hearing had closed, Penn and Central soften there opposition to inclusion of the New Haven and indicated that they would be willing to work out some arrangement with the New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.297" offset="12580551">And at this point which was two and one half years ago, C &amp; J petitioned to intervene and to offer evidence showing how badly it would be damaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.719" offset="12630288">The Commission allowed the petition for intervention but it did not allow C &amp; J to introduce it evidence saying that it had stood by during the first round of hearings and that it was too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.245" offset="12684309">At the very same time the Commission in it same order did reopened these hearings for September of 1964 to hear some evidence on the labor conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.406" offset="12736972">And as it turned out, hearing C &amp; J at that time would not have done any harm at all or delay in the process because the examiners did not file their report until March of 1965, some eight months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.033" offset="12807502">So that the Commission was simply wrong when in its decision on reconsideration, it lumped C &amp; J with N &amp; W, B &amp; O and C &amp; O instead of all four that their expressions of discontent now more than four years after the merger application was filed come to late for theory of consideration herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.134" offset="12919933">For more than two of those four years, the C &amp; J was doing it's very best to be heard and the Commission would not hear it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.381" offset="12960893">The theory of latches is even weaker as applied to the other Penn-Central terms that are merged even later and also injures C &amp; J.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.391" offset="13000913">For example, the indemnity arrangements that are provided for the three protected roads did not come to light until they first appeared in the Commission's original report and order of April 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.852" offset="13058800">C &amp; J promptly requested reconsideration and asked for such protective indemnity terms for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.630" offset="13093909">But the Commission again refused on the same theory of latches and even applied that theory of latches to the notion of a capital indemnity which had been introduced as an idea for the very first time in the petitions of reconsideration of the other railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.864" offset="13166843">In any event, we would submit that the theory of latches does not fit the framework of an administrative agency that is suppose to find where the public interest lies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.626" offset="13217834">To illustrate the point, we need only look at what the Commission did for the three protected roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.709" offset="13246255">It found that they provided essential services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.059" offset="13259630">That they could not survive Penn-Central and that as the Commission said, “Unless they are protected during the period necessary to determine their future we would not authorize consummation at this time”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.698" offset="13314173">Now let's assume that one of those three protected roads had also been late in presenting its evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.766" offset="13342386">Could the Commission as the guardian of the public interest say that, “Even though this evidence had they heard it would have convinced them of the above conclusions that they would nevertheless deprive the public of this essential service because the applicant had been too late”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.047" offset="13419604">We think the answer is obviously not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.936" offset="13431097">And yet that's precisely the way the Commission has treated C &amp; J.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.493" offset="13457324">Mr. -- so much for the argument that C &amp; J is too late.</text>

            <text syncTime="3404.558" offset="13721579">But as we've shown in the briefs of the appellants in this case, conditions devised at a later time may never work out and provide the kind of protection that we need.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.152" offset="13776018">Moreover, they may come far too late to do us any possible good.</text>

            <text syncTime="3497.057" offset="14091577">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.246" offset="14104325">I represent the Erie-Lackawanna which is the largest and usually the first named of the three so-called protected railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.122" offset="14155839">Now our case here, and our case below, is very, very narrow as been the case that was put to you by Mr. Trienens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.905" offset="14198993">We are in the anomalous position here in that the Norfolk &amp; Western and those affiliated with it have a very broad program with which the Erie-Lackawanna and the D &amp; H and counsel for the D &amp; H who will follow on me do not agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.065" offset="14275584">So it is not surprising that while Mr. Trienens said higher in the Court in thinking that the Commission should not have been sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.603" offset="14317798">Mr. Trienens and I disagree a great deal about many of the things that he had said to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.124" offset="14351862">Another thing that I want to emphasize is that we have -- we stand on specific findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.602" offset="14389791">We stand on a specific course that was followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.486" offset="14405360">We stand on specific statutes as made -- seen to be a dry approach to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.829" offset="14438693">But Erie-Lackawanna is an important railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.343" offset="14452694">It isn't as if it was some trolley line that had to die so that progress should go ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.465" offset="14481220">It serves the country from the Port of New York to Chicago on its own lines with Buffalo and immediate cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.231" offset="14520299">It serves -- it go -- it reaches to St. Louis through connections and then of course its traffic to interchange all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.664" offset="14558020">Its revenue last year -- in 1965 were approximately $230 million neither is the D &amp; H who were following the -- a railroad that is to be looked upon as unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.062" offset="14619669">I will say no more about their importance because the Commission unanimously found that they were essential unanimously and I don't see why since nobody challenges those findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.097" offset="14679751">I should take the time of this Court to say that they're supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.608" offset="14705768">I want to mention two other points of explicit disagreement with Mr. Trienens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.883" offset="14730951">But first of all, we do not agree that the provisions for and indemnification condition was an illegal pool under Section 5 (1) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.445" offset="14793122">I would like to call your attention to the fact that testimony on that subject at the adjourned hearings for which the condition provided has been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.702" offset="14850173">Mr. Trienens introduces a testimony of an Emily Gail, Professor and does not introduce cross examination of the (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.115" offset="14899806">Briefs haven't yet been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.546" offset="14909524">The question is to whether that's an illegal pool hardly seems to me the day before the Court because actually at the present time there is no indemnification condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.113" offset="14959783">Any decision by this Court on that subject would be a many of something that doesn't yet exist in the light of inadequate argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.338" offset="15004714">He spoke also of the capital indemnity issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.856" offset="15018820">I would like to say on that that while I do not minimize its importance it is not been mention in any document filed by Erie-Lackawanna with this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.325" offset="15072632">Our appeal has been based squarely and exclusively on points that were raised below and our emphasis has been on the so-called protective conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3919.943" offset="15783163">Then the Commission went on to say, “Our pool other than merger for undelayed consummation shall be subject therefore to the conditions specifically described in Appendix G”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.032" offset="15847528">Now, an argument is made by one of the counsels for one of the appellees that all the Commission said is, “Well, they've got to be protected in some way or other".</text>

            <text syncTime="3979.089" offset="16019728">When we have an opportunity to study what they had done and Mr. Trienens is completely direct in saying that the were no advance nor was there any kind whatsoever that this type of thing was even under consideration with no hearing, no opportunity for argument, nothing was done within the walls of the building where the Commission sit as its offices by whoever did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.069" offset="16155669">We've studied them and we felt that they were very seriously defective both in substance and in form.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.997" offset="16199346">On July 8, reason to believe we filed a petition for reconsideration in which after untold hours of work we tried to refrain in such a way as to do what we thought should be done.</text>

            <text syncTime="4211.085" offset="16947702">So the Commission provided that there should be further hearings and they said that until the traffic conditions which were extraordinarily complex extremely important and in our view, very defective.</text>

            <text syncTime="4239.144" offset="17059924">The other condition, the indemnification condition which was the Mr. Trienens has mentioned was ascended in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="4249.194" offset="17100152">And the Commission said, “Though or indicative that if it were reinstated or if any were reinstated that would be retroactive to the days of consummation”.</text>
            <text syncTime="4259.905" offset="17142993">And then the Commission said, “Go ahead with the consummation”.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.271" offset="17160443">And our position is that there are no findings in that September 16 report which can conceivably be cited as justifying what the Commission did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4279.339" offset="17220733">Even if it -- he had assumed that the fact that the Commission did what it thought had, what it had to do implied that it thought that was the right thing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.041" offset="17275486">It gave no reasons at all to amount anything certainly not as to the protected conditions except to say that all these issues has been raised.</text>

            <text syncTime="4338.216" offset="17456253">In this case this is an opinion in a following case which I think is now before this Court brought by New Haven's farm holders.</text>

            <text syncTime="4350.822" offset="17506617">But he distinguishes between that case and this case in these words and these sums up our case better than I can do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4358.992" offset="17539323">In the Erie case, the Commission has found that the public interest required protection of the three carriers against the adverse effect of a merger and as a condition of consummation imposed specific protective terms which are subsequently revoked ex parte in my view without adequate supporting findings as to one condition and lesser future determination as to others.</text>

            <text syncTime="4713.623" offset="18957876">I would simply like to refer to the discussions of our briefs of the re -- statements by the Commission that these two railroads were invulnerable and highly sensitive financial condition to railroads, it made a $122 million in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="4732.820" offset="19034676">I would like also call attention to the point that deals with all the reasons the Commission gave for prompt consummation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4740.826" offset="19066650">And finally to the point -- the effect of the court below really base its decision to a considerable degree on suppositions and conjectures that had absolutely no support in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4752.797" offset="19114611">Now as to the New Haven, I cannot tell you and I don't think it's my -- really my job to tell you all about New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="4759.924" offset="19143032">I will come to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4761.754" offset="19150346">Our position is this, they requested deferment until the protected conditions are determined even if judicial review is involved, involves no threat to the New Haven as you could measure, no treat to the New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="4779.365" offset="19220877">I think the threat to the New Haven if even deferring until we are included in the Norfolk and Western would be very slight.</text>
            <text syncTime="4790.037" offset="19263509">The reason the Commission did what it did was because it would not find out what the facts were.</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.809" offset="19290572">And in our petition to reconsideration we asked them to find out more about New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.368" offset="19316799">All they were told was that New Haven was in a desperate condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4807.731" offset="19334248">That it had to be a Penn-Central merger to save the New Haven, repeated and repeated, repeated with no explanation of the connection between the Penn-Central merger and the New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="4820.005" offset="19383359">And they decided that was right and refused to find out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4824.318" offset="19400600">Now, I feel that since the New Haven Trustees and the four states have a total of an hour and a quarter they together have an obligation to tell this Court, first, what is really required to bring about the inclusion of New Haven?</text>
            <text syncTime="4846.308" offset="19488580">Mr. Justice Harlan wondered whether they were only procedural points.</text>
            <text syncTime="4849.622" offset="19501850">The answer isn't they're not only procedural points.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.593" offset="19513762">They are very substantive points involving both this proceeding and Section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, the reorganization proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4863.251" offset="19556394">How long will it take to guesses below were up to two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4868.608" offset="19577814">Well, my own view is that's optimistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="4873.177" offset="19596100">And finally in this I think is crucial, why and how and to what extent will a deferment of Penn-Central merger have any effect on the solution to the New Haven problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4886.169" offset="19648031">Now, there's no answer to say that the New Haven is in desperate condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4890.609" offset="19665795">It's out of cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.874" offset="19670915">It may not have enough cash to survive and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4894.147" offset="19680005">Unless you show that by jeopardizing the Erie-Lackawanna and the Delaware and Hudson, you're going to save the New Haven or at least help to save New Haven very substantially.</text>
            <text syncTime="4906.633" offset="19729951">There is a complete lack of any showing and I think the burden is on them to make the showing in specifics not in statements about the desperate conditions of the New Haven and how everybody wants the New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="4927.134" offset="19811871">I'm a native of New Haven, grew up in New Haven, and lived -- a resident now of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="4933.976" offset="19839248">I'm not going to stand here and try to box something that is required by the New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="4941.084" offset="19867669">But I have yet after months and months, and months, and months of work on this case to find any intelligible statement on the other side or by the Commission as to why -- what we are trying to do to protect the Erie-Lackawanna is going to hurt to New Haven.</text>

            <text syncTime="4965.991" offset="19967352">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4969.701" offset="19982190">I speak for the Delaware and Hudson Railroad Corporation, appellant in Number 680.</text>
            <text syncTime="4980.007" offset="20023359">It has been stated by the Commission in its brief that the truly unique feature of this case is a fact that there is no outright opposition to the merger by any railroad and language to this general effect appears in Judge Friendly's opinion below.</text>
            <text syncTime="4999.500" offset="20101413">The impression that this creates is that conditions which other railroads have requested are perhaps of a collateral and certainly relatively unimportant nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.823" offset="20158673">That is a very wrong impression about this case because the truly unique feature about it is not the fact that there's been no outright opposition by another railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="5024.950" offset="20203186">The truly unique feature is the reason why there has been no outright opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5030.409" offset="20225024">And that reason is this, in the three merger cases that we had have in the East so far, C &amp; O, B &amp; O, and the N &amp; W-Nickel Plate, Penn-Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="5041.232" offset="20268283">There has been a remarkably constructive approach by the management so the other railroads affect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5048.920" offset="20299003">They have not as in other parts of the country sat back and said, “No, we oppose and flatly will obstruct any merger".</text>
            <text syncTime="5057.529" offset="20333484">They have not as they might have done all sought inclusion in Penn-Central at the same time thereby creating even more of a dilemma for the Commission than it now have.</text>
            <text syncTime="5069.059" offset="20379564">What they did was to seek to work out a rational approach to the whole merger picture in the East realizing that mergers was desirable as a matter of the economics of the industry, realizing further that the policy of the law supports and wishes to facilitate rail mergers. Now that is where the matter of conditions come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="5093.670" offset="20478098">How to advance the railroad merger movement without obstruction and without real injury to essential railroads?</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.050" offset="20523551">Now, it's been said already as you know that the Commission has found that these three so-called “Protected Roads, E-L and D &amp; H and B &amp; M are essential in public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5116.767" offset="20570467">Their service must be preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5119.525" offset="20581439">They further found that without inclusion in one of the systems they could not withstand or it was doubtful that they could withstand competition in Penn-Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="5130.295" offset="20624593">They further said there were only two ways they could see to protect them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5133.928" offset="20639117">One was by inclusion and the other by some interim protective conditions until they finally decided in which system they should be included.</text>
            <text syncTime="5144.869" offset="20682898">Now, the injury to the D &amp; H is so well documented before the Commission and I don't really have to go into it but I would like to make this one point in connection with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5156.537" offset="20729501">The D &amp; H is a perfectly buyable railroad on its own today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5161.752" offset="20750399">It has been a profit making railroad for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5166.471" offset="20769207">What is the trouble in this merger situation so far as D &amp; H is concern is Penn-Central and Penn-Central only?</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.399" offset="20797001">We had no cause to complain about the other two mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5177.750" offset="20814346">But Penn-Central would as the Commission found make it impossible in all likelihood for D &amp; H to survive as an independent road.</text>
            <text syncTime="5186.121" offset="20847888">And D &amp; H is the key to further continuance of rail competition in New England because it provide the connection with the roads to its West and South with the Boston and Maine which is the only railroad that will be left of any significance to provide competition in New England.</text>
            <text syncTime="5205.725" offset="20926255">Now, we have said to the Commission, "Yes, we would like to have inclusion if we can".</text>
            <text syncTime="5211.811" offset="20950601">But we've also said if you think you can find conditions that really will protect us in the interim we'll go along with that but we've got to be sure that the conditions are satisfactory because as you yourself have found.</text>
            <text syncTime="5227.251" offset="21012355">You would not let this merger go to consummation unless there is protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="5233.728" offset="21038268">Now, I can't think of a clearer way for the Commission to have found that this kind of protected condition or the condition precedent to the consummation of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="5246.330" offset="21088737">And being a condition precedent and being also as they found in the September 16 report that it was necessary to have a hearing with respect to these conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5256.818" offset="21130637">It seems to me essential as a matter of principles of administrative law that that hearing must be held first before the merger goes through.</text>
            <text syncTime="5266.446" offset="21169194">And now with respect to these conditions, there are two difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5270.328" offset="21184658">One relates to the recession of the indemnity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5274.934" offset="21203153">The indemnification provision as we viewed it was inadequate but nevertheless it did provide substantial protection in addition to the so-called traffic restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5287.482" offset="21253308">The Commission by rescinding that has as Judge Weinfeld dissenting below said, undermined its whole finding that undelayed consummation of the merger was consistent with the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.535" offset="21309524">And it does no good to say that these conditions may be retroactively reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5308.407" offset="21337004">The point is they may not be retroactively reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5311.756" offset="21350379">We do not know until the Commission finishes the task of coming up with these conditions and is able to itself way the significance of those conditions against the desirability on other grounds for going ahead with the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="5331.665" offset="21430000">In that connection, it is important to realize as Judge Friendly's opinion makes clear below that the court below was of the view that if we didn't even get the indemnity provisions, the traffic conditions would probably be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="5351.539" offset="21509517">And that was a view which was undoubtedly concluded by the court below in the light of what was said by the Penn-Central people in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="5367.205" offset="21572211">Now, what they said was that these conditions are very broad, very extensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5371.934" offset="21591124">You could not even devise a restraining order that would be even -- that would be anymore prohibitive on their conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5379.403" offset="21621008">They said we simply will not be able to improve our service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5383.515" offset="21637413">We cannot divert any traffic from these three roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="5386.692" offset="21650160">So, the traffic conditions on there face as construed in the court below would appear and that certainly the court below was impressed by this would appear to provide sufficient protection with the matter of indemnity being perhaps a box stop as they call it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5406.999" offset="21731349">But the trouble is that in the hearings that if the just recently been concluded a totally different interpretation has been placed on those conditions by the Pennsylvania's own witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5419.708" offset="21782235">When I say that, I do not in any sense mean to charge either counsel or the witness with an attempt to mislead either the Court or the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5430.069" offset="21823613">The difficulty stems from the facts that these conditions despite their apparent clarity are not clear at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5438.230" offset="21856319">What has happened is this, the Pennsylvania witness in these further hearings has said, contrary to the opinion of counsel that was expressed below, he has said, "We will not be banned as I read these conditions from soliciting traffic for Penn-Central against the Erie-Lackawanna, D &amp; H and D &amp; M.</text>
            <text syncTime="5457.310" offset="21932596">We won't be banned from soliciting traffic and conjunction with our future partner the New Haven against these three roads despite the fact that Judge Friendly very clearly in the court below was interested in this matter of solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5473.436" offset="21997066">I have quoted in out reply brief the good portion of the record to show what was said there and to show what Judge Friendly's interest in this matter was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5482.779" offset="22034474">What we have in other words today is the unhappy situation of a very unclear set of traffic conditions requiring it nothing else, a clarification by the Commission as a result of this further hearing which was recently concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="5497.302" offset="22092570">We have at the most only a possibility of getting an indemnity provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5504.870" offset="22122872">We know we have some questions raised which I like -- Mr. Bourne do not agree with but nevertheless questions have been raised by the N &amp; W, B &amp; O, C &amp;O group as to the legality of such conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5519.004" offset="22179401">It does not seem under these circumstances possible to me for anyone to conclude that the conditions which we will have in effect if this merger were to go through tomorrow would be in any sense adequate to protect us.</text>
            <text syncTime="5536.117" offset="22247842">And it is on that ground principally the Delaware and Hudson relied so far as the reversal of the court below is concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="5544.386" offset="22280965">We think this proceeding is in the state where remand is required at least until the Commission had issued its decision on these conditions so that the parties can determine whether or not they merely have any protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="5563.923" offset="22359019">Whether the Commission itself -- so that the Commission itself, I should say can determine the significance of those conditions as finally determined in the light of the other considerations which they think lead to the desirability of undelayed consummation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5581.820" offset="22430699">Now in that connection, Judge Friendly referred below through the fact that the Commission had a duty to avoid prejudgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5594.335" offset="22480750">I fully agree, I think that a judicial or quasi-judicial body must avoid prejudgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5602.293" offset="22512515">Therefore it must not determine that these conditions that are in existence today are adequate until they have heard the evidence and heard the arguments about the evidence and they've reached a conclusion in that light.</text>
            <text syncTime="5620.702" offset="22586180">In that respect I would also like to point out another difficulty with the Commission's report of September 16 as we see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5631.812" offset="22630588">The Commission in that report laid out as it thought the factors alongside and the other on whether or not to proceed with merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="5643.157" offset="22676041">And among of those factors was the thought that because a delay and the merger might delay the ultimate accomplishment of savings and benefits to the public, the merger ought not to be delay because there would be a very substantial benefit to the public ultimately from this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="5663.642" offset="22757961">The difficulty is again, that until we know what Appendix G conditions, traffic conditions really mean for Penn-Central you cannot determine whether -- a days delayed now with Appendix G in operation is any worse to the Penn-Central than delay of the merger entirely until these conditions are finally determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="5689.517" offset="22861406">In that connection, I would simply point out this as an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="5693.499" offset="22877393">The Penn-Central in their briefs said what they thought the Commission meant by this talk about the days delay at the beginning, being days delay at the end was that Capital Improvement Programs by Penn-Central could at least be initiated during the period of Appendix G was in effect and if this would necessarily hasten in the long run the benefits to the public which the merger would permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5721.879" offset="22990869">That is an excellent example of the problem that is involved in these Appendix G conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5728.624" offset="23017827">If as the Pennsylvania's traffic witness construed them in these recent hearing as not in effect prohibiting construction of new facilities on the lines of the present Penn or the lines of the present Central just so long as you didn't use both lines for your new facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5745.849" offset="23086791">If that's what Appendix G really means then of course they'll begin their capital improvement program.</text>
            <text syncTime="5752.828" offset="23114689">But that very situation will deprive us of what little protection the traffic conditions will afford.</text>
            <text syncTime="5759.951" offset="23143215">The principal thing that we are worried about is the const -- or a principal thing is the construction of a yard at Selkirk, New York right on the D &amp; H doorstep which will be the focal point for the handling of all traffic moving East and West over this new Penn-Central system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5780.227" offset="23224299">Now, if they are allowed to build that yard for dimensions for ultimate use by Penn-Central which under the Pennsylvania witness' interpretation as I understand that they would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5791.245" offset="23268394">All of the traffic that we are worrying about that would move through that yard and take traffic away from us or the advantages of having it move it through that yard would accrue even while this Appendix G conditions were in effect assuming that we never included before the yard is finished.</text>
            <text syncTime="5810.838" offset="23346761">Now, if on the other --</text>

            <text syncTime="5817.148" offset="23371943">And it's the -- is the point where the New York Central's lines from New York City to Albany, from Boston to Albany, and from the west to Albany all converge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5830.168" offset="23424084">If on the other hand Appendix G has any real teeth in it and means what we thought the Commission thought it was suppose to mean then we doubt very seriously that Penn-Central would construct to any substantial degree a large of these additional facilities because until they know how long Appendix G is going to be in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5856.458" offset="23529200">It would probably be against there interest to construct facilities and then have to let them lie idle until Appendix G went off and they could use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5868.182" offset="23576116">So, the principle problem at the moment is getting far -- a far as to what Appendix G means.</text>
            <text syncTime="5875.790" offset="23606523">I'm getting assurance as to whether there is to be anything in addition to traffic conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5881.797" offset="23630555">Now it may well be that when we see those conditions, we would be reasonably satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="5889.892" offset="23662947">We would go along and say, "Yes, we'll work with this until our own inclusion is effective".</text>
            <text syncTime="5898.414" offset="23697011">But until we know what they are, until the Commission itself and my judgment knows what they mean we cannot take that chance in the light of their own findings and their own findings as I said before are completely documented by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5914.681" offset="23762108">The difficulty with traffic conditions I might say is recognized really by all the people really associated in the traffic business.</text>
            <text syncTime="5924.056" offset="23799620">I might refer for instance to the testimony of the traffic vice president of the New Haven Railroad in this proceeding some years back before we knew what these conditions were.</text>
            <text syncTime="5936.821" offset="23850611">But at that time the New Haven was putting in its case to show the real harm Penn-Central would cause to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5943.407" offset="23877047">And he said, "I know of no conditions which the Commission could impose which could in any way prevent the diversion of traffic to which I have testified".</text>
            <text syncTime="5953.689" offset="23918111">Now, I'm not saying that he would say that quite that strongly if he knew at the time that these conditions were in line.</text>
            <text syncTime="5961.838" offset="23950712">But it does show that the novelty of these conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5966.056" offset="23967640">The untried character of these conditions and at this point, the completely unclear nature of the conditions in concrete application justified the very real concern as Judge -- as -- is apparent from what we have said in the brief that we do not believe that anyone can say that these conditions provide adequate protection which the Commission by its own finding that it said its absolutely necessary to undelayed consummation of the merger.</text>

            <text syncTime="6009.489" offset="24141302">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6013.407" offset="24156975">I realize the difficulty in the Court of law of reconstructing a railroad reorganization proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6021.941" offset="24191143">And therefore in representing Scranton and I will try to get back from the problems of small railroads or even their squabbles, the large problems of a great nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6035.396" offset="24244955">For it is my considered view that no matter what may be done about these smaller railroads in the near future or on the longer future.</text>
            <text syncTime="6046.477" offset="24289259">The basic merger of Penn-Central on the basis proposed, on the basis approved by the Commission, on the basis projected with due violence to the prime criterion of an adequate transportation service for the people and the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="6066.649" offset="24369925">Would do this damage not only in the eastern district and therefore throughout the nation because of the importance of that districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6073.735" offset="24398346">And of course would do even more damage to particularly vulnerable sectors of the eastern districts such as the State of Pennsylvania and the City of Scranton.</text>
            <text syncTime="6084.411" offset="24440978">Now, the reasons why these injuries are of legal significance are threefold.</text>
            <text syncTime="6088.008" offset="24455398">First, the findings of the Commission, not the findings they may make in some speculative future proceedings but the findings they did make in this proceeding where unsupported by the evidence on the record as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="6103.246" offset="24516315">Second, the Commission substituted its own policies for those of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="6109.060" offset="24539617">And third, the Commission found no countervailing benefits in the public interest to outweigh the general applicability of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="6121.009" offset="24587368">Now, the heart of this merger proposal requires a little history.</text>
            <text syncTime="6124.960" offset="24603251">In 1960 -- 1953, the country started on the period of low economic growth that probes problems to many industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="6133.477" offset="24637315">The railroads like others were hit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6136.125" offset="24647868">But unlike other industries which sought to work out their salvation through becoming more competitive and through investing in modernization to meet the challenge of better times when they came.</text>
            <text syncTime="6149.342" offset="24700740">These two roads did two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="6152.104" offset="24711816">They drastically slash their services, railroads, locomotives, freight cars to the tune of 26% to 48%.</text>
            <text syncTime="6163.226" offset="24756328">And second, they allowed their prices in the face of advancing it to motor competition to remain 37% higher than those that they have been in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="6174.646" offset="24801991">Then, when these two roads were hurt most in their income by their own misguided policies, they sought to the merger to find salvation through a further extension of the same policies that it hurt them this far because the heart of a merger proposal was not to achieve savings by expansion, by modernization.</text>
            <text syncTime="6199.018" offset="24899480">The heart of the merger was to achieve $80 million in savings primarily by further slashes in facilities and services.</text>
            <text syncTime="6208.427" offset="24937096">And this of course had to be defended first on the ground that these slashed services would comport with the needs of the nation in terms of economic growth and in terms of the traffic carriers particularly ten miles it would impose upon the two-mile roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="6225.422" offset="25005014">Now, the very heart of this case is found in one little chart at the very end of my appendix brief which compares the findings on which the Commission approves this merger not with hypothesis but with one that actually happened when they approved the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="6245.706" offset="25086203">Because the railroads has estimated and the examiners had based approval of the merger or recommended approval upon traffic in this forecast in 1961 through 1970 because no comprehensive data late of 1961 were available and the case was prepared in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="6265.459" offset="25165197">But when the case was before the Commission in early 1966 it knew that when is very forecast which is still accepting were based upon an economic growth rate of 3% in 1961 to 1970. The actual growth rate from 1961 to 1965 have been 5.4% or 80% higher than the very forecast upon which the Commission itself acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6290.384" offset="25264880">Second, with respect to traffic, the Commission's decision was founded and the projection that from 1961 traffic were declined 6 1/2% by 1965, at 9% by 1970 when the Commission acted, traffic had actually gone up 22% since 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="6311.301" offset="25348577">Since 1961 and 1966, it was 43% higher than the Commission's forecast for 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="6318.487" offset="25377311">And similarly is to find answers, the Commission's finding were rooted in the minus $9 million of net income in 1961, whereas in 1965, it was $75 million and consolidated income was about $100 million, and cash flow which is more important that year was about $166 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="6342.151" offset="25471979">Now, I've come to other reasons why income isn't really relevant at all but there it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="6347.134" offset="25491937">Now, how did the Commission get around the fact that in itself was adopting findings which the fact before it shown had already been refuted by 5 years of experience?</text>
            <text syncTime="6358.544" offset="25537599">It said, “maybe”, over the years between 1966 and 1970 there's going to be such a cataclysmic decline of the economy of United States that over the whole period of 1961-1970 the railroads and the examiners will turn out to be right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6377.643" offset="25613981">Now, this was not only irrational in terms where were in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="6381.791" offset="25630490">It was not only irrational in terms of the whole record from 1922 and 1961 where you have a much higher rate of growth than they have hypothesize even including the great depression.</text>
            <text syncTime="6394.709" offset="25682213">And it violated the requirements that the Commission not substituted philosophy of who invest for the emphasis of transportation legislation upon adequacy of service and growth because if the railroads are permitted to budget their facilities upon the average of the trust, of the peaks of the business cycle, they will always militate against full prosperity and always be short with the actual prosperity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6420.795" offset="25786598">And frequent -- and many items of congressional legislation recognizes as of now that they are seriously shown on the eastern district and indeed throughout the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6431.752" offset="25830379">Furthermore, let us look at what would have to happen for the forecast upon which the Commission acted to come through in the future eventhough they have been so outrageously wrong at the time when the Commission acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6446.107" offset="25887848">We would have to have in the next three years a decline in the U.S. economic growth rate about 1%. We would have to have a decline in traffic of these roads at about 30% and this could happen only in the event of a national economic calamity that would wreck us both at home and overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="6467.367" offset="25972799">And if Regulatory Commission out of predicate, the budgeting of the facilities of great industries of this gloomy hypothesis, they will have to propitiate the very thing that they should be seeking to avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="6482.827" offset="26034657">Now, these wrong findings as to traffic collapse all of the findings out of financial basis because the examiners fail and the Commission has approved that their primary concern was the financial condition of the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="6499.262" offset="26100381">Now, even aside for the fact that minus 9 if they change to a 120 -- plus a 122 by the time the Commission acted, aside from that, the mandate of the Congress is the prime test if the adequacy of needs and no savings plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="6516.620" offset="26169866">Predicated upon saving the investor by starving the public can't pass on the congressional legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6524.876" offset="26202885">My findings as to traffic needs which were before the Commission which is turn out to be precise and be right where they acted to the decimal point were consistent with the need more facilities by 1970 not less.</text>
            <text syncTime="6537.475" offset="26253249">And the Congress by that time, in many ways, and the Commission has found for in many ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="6542.980" offset="26275297">And re -- and the administrative agencies in many ways and the tax reductions had help the railroads to the tune of the of hundreds of millions of dollars in income for the purpose of enabling to meet the criterion of adequacy of service rather than to be guided by the criterion of how the railroads could save themselves by starving the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="6563.641" offset="26357948">Now, in 1967, the proponents of the railroad merger come forward and say, “We want modernization, this is what we're going to us these savings for”.</text>
            <text syncTime="6576.326" offset="26408626">We want to compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="6578.617" offset="26417821">We want to expand services.</text>
            <text syncTime="6581.403" offset="26429001">But this is not the purpose on which the savings -- the savings will projected.</text>
            <text syncTime="6585.577" offset="26445720">This is not the basis on which they were examined by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="6589.229" offset="26460244">This is not the basis on which they were supported by the findings of the Commission and this is not the basis on which the merger was approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6598.031" offset="26495457">The history from 196 -- from 1953 to now shows, from 1961 shows that without benefit of merger the two roads have increased their carriage by 25% per ten miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="6613.097" offset="26555747">They haven't met the shortages that they themselves created but then if -- if they could increase carriage by 25% without the merger, they can increase it still more without merger and their internal income is sufficient for this purpose and their external income is sufficient for this purpose as indicated by the fact of security markets it apprised.</text>
            <text syncTime="6634.487" offset="26641324">There are common stocks tremendously and the rate of return is irrelevant although it will be argued to contrary because the rate of return is merely a commentary upon whether it is feasible for them to borrow money.</text>
            <text syncTime="6646.815" offset="26690644">And the benefits to that is the valuation of their stocks with the security markets and in any event just as the Commission was wrong in all of its income findings, it was equally wrong on its rate of return findings because rate of return depends ultimately on the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="6662.926" offset="26755114">Now, the Commission says, “They will be able to compete better with in the modal transportation if they merge”.</text>
            <text syncTime="6668.846" offset="26778728">The first requirement of competing in the modal is to compete among ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="6673.334" offset="26796701">We can't play tennis against the Australians if we don't practice amongst ourselves and the automobile industry couldn't compete with other modes of transport if they didn't compete among themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="6683.910" offset="26839019">Every legitimate purpose of expansion of modernization of competition does not require this merger and therefore, there is no justification whatsoever for this merge around the ground that conditions of the public interest outweigh the limited applications of the Antitrust Laws to corporate mergers of railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="6706.841" offset="26930761">This merger if a comp -- if accomplished would put it of the hands of Penn-Central about 40% of the total gross revenues of the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="6717.830" offset="26974647">This is very close to General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6720.439" offset="26985096">Some people think General Motors is too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="6722.364" offset="26992828">In any event General Motors wasn't achieved by an official Government sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6726.753" offset="27010382">And in any event, when General Motors occupies 40% of the markets, it has 60% competition everywhere throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="6734.429" offset="27041102">When Penn-Central occupied 40% of the markets, their preemption of the market at 150 communities which they both serve may run up for 40%, 60% to 80%, to a 100%.</text>
            <text syncTime="6746.825" offset="27090631">An opponent of the merger asks the Commission to study this question which it refused to do, but even compared with the 40 -- with a 39%.</text>
            <text syncTime="6757.871" offset="27134830">The preemption of the market runs only from 29% to 8% by such corporations as U.S. Steel, Alcoa, Dupont, Bank of America, Metropolitan Life, Standard Oil of New Jersey and all except to one of them are below 19%.</text>
            <text syncTime="6776.514" offset="27209435">If we need a reorganization of railroads in the eastern district, there can be no balance based upon these months to come by.</text>
            <text syncTime="6786.586" offset="27249768">In fact, by showing on Chart 23 of my joint appendix in view of the tremendous acquisitions, the tremendous mergers and the tremendous acquisitions of non-railroad properties which these two roads have already undertaken, if they couldn't work themselves out of their troubles by all of that growth, they got into trouble because they were already to swollen and rather than too small.</text>
            <text syncTime="6810.718" offset="27346213">Finally, I would point out that this merger was opposed until 1966 by the counsel of economic advisers and part of the Inter-Agency Committee and by the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="6821.279" offset="27388531">I would like to analyze why a merger repose with the railroads were allegedly in financial crisis in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="6828.534" offset="27417475">It's in Court in the 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="6830.959" offset="27427192">This merger was wrong in 1961, it's more wrong today.</text>
            <text syncTime="6834.496" offset="27441403">It is based upon their contraction and restriction of the transportation based in our economy in the nation which we now know with all the economic growth to date can hardly meet its great domestic and international responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6848.172" offset="27496051">To survive and prosper, we must grow.</text>
            <text syncTime="6850.490" offset="27505351">Nothing would be gained by setting this merger back.</text>
            <text syncTime="6853.163" offset="27516008">I respectfully submit it should be denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="6865.873" offset="27566895">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6869.015" offset="27579434">I appear here today on behalf of Milton J. Shapp, appellant in Number 814.</text>
            <text syncTime="6874.745" offset="27602317">The relief we seek is that this merger be set aside in a note in total.</text>
            <text syncTime="6879.855" offset="27622797">This is not just a railroad merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="6882.294" offset="27632515">Over 200 corporations are being merged, if this merger is approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6886.695" offset="27650173">This merger of a truck lines, pipelines, and vast real estate holdings would be the larger merger ever accomplished in the history of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6896.175" offset="27688103">Mr. Shapp has been a persistent opponent of this merger ever since 1962 and appeared actively in the proceedings at the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="6905.320" offset="27724675">He and representatives of various Pennsylvania communities testified as to the harm of this merger with this is it upon citizens of the State of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="6913.893" offset="27758947">The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania testified, cities of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Erie dozen of towns along the Pennsylvania Railroad mainline.</text>
            <text syncTime="6925.199" offset="27804191">Now, what does this record show?</text>
            <text syncTime="6927.221" offset="27812237">It showed that the basic plan for operating these two parallel roads will reduce present Pennsylvania Railroad freight miles -- train miles by one-third.</text>
            <text syncTime="6936.021" offset="27847450">One-third of all the present Pennsylvania Railroad freight trade miles will be eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="6941.198" offset="27868139">Mr. Shapp and the commonwealth have testified -- the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania showed that 35% of the through freight trains operated in State of Pennsylvania will be eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="6951.608" offset="27909831">The Commission on that found 9%.</text>
            <text syncTime="6953.532" offset="27917458">But even 9% of all through freight trains in the State of Pennsylvania will be eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="6958.879" offset="27938879">Now, what is the basic plan of merger?</text>
            <text syncTime="6961.435" offset="27949119">The plan of merger is to divert all traffic originating or terminating west of Youngstown in Columbus, Ohio on the one hand and north and east of Linden, New Jersey on the other hand divert this traffic which now moves across State of Pennsylvania from Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and set it up to Cleveland to Buffalo and across the so-called water level route of the New York Central to Albany, passing through Rochester and Syracuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="6986.186" offset="28048071">Then from Albany then Selkirk just below, Albany, a huge new classification yard will be built and this traffic would come down to New York and the Jersey metropolitan area or it could go into New England, the Boston before the New York Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="6999.807" offset="28102614">So the basic plan of merger is to take away this traffic now moving across Pennsylvania and route it over the New York Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="7007.028" offset="28131453">And in every major town on the Pennsylvania Railroad mainline oppose this at the ICC and introduced testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="7014.464" offset="28161233">But this merger does not only hurt towns located on the Pennsylvania Railroad mainline.</text>
            <text syncTime="7019.113" offset="28179832">Traffic will no longer move between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia up to New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="7022.978" offset="28195297">It hurts towns located off the main land of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="7026.187" offset="28208149">The City of Scranton is one example.</text>
            <text syncTime="7028.569" offset="28217657">Commissioner Webb's report in this plan in stock of 21510 mentioned Moosic and North Hampton in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="7036.234" offset="28248273">They're located off the Pennsylvania Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="7038.938" offset="28259140">The technician finds that the Erie-Lackawanna and Delaware and Hudson can survive this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="7044.251" offset="28280351">Now, Scranton served by the E-L, D &amp; H, and C &amp; J and this suppose to be included in some other merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="7050.610" offset="28305847">So, if that happens, Scranton instead of having three railroads today will have two railroads today and then what happens?</text>
            <text syncTime="7056.206" offset="28328208">The Norfolk and Western and C &amp; O, they filed there application for merger and the C &amp; J, the Jersey Central is suppose to go into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7063.123" offset="28355897">So instead of Scranton now enjoined three competitive railroads, it's going to have one.</text>
            <text syncTime="7067.371" offset="28372825">But none of this adequate competitive impact which the lower court says it's going to be with clairvoyance was evaluated in passing upon the Penn-Central merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="7076.020" offset="28407411">Therefore, we have the case-by-case approach where towns like Scranton, Moosic and I might say that Mr. Webb didn't mention it but there are eight counties in Pennsylvania who participates -- who are parties in that report that he issued in December and three cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="7091.979" offset="28471254">You'll only find two, you have mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="7093.590" offset="28477733">There's a lot of people throughout Pennsylvania very much interested in this merger.</text>

            <text syncTime="7118.290" offset="28576580">The Commission announced they were going to have hearings in Philadelphia and in Pennsylvania, was open to the public and a lot of members of the public came.</text>

            <text syncTime="7131.376" offset="28628825">And no one has ever challenged his standing anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="7134.285" offset="28640528">We got these briefs last Friday and it's impossible for me to go through Professor Jacques' works and other citations and to answer the legal arguments raised on his standing to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="7144.175" offset="28680025">I can say it was not raised in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7147.279" offset="28692459">It was specifically brought up to the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7149.365" offset="28700818">Judge asked nobody made an objection but one all the way up here to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7154.528" offset="28721507">He does have standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="7155.609" offset="28725791">Any merger that's going to have this impact on the State of Pennsylvania where you're going to loss 9 or 35% of your freight train miles, where your two traffics is going to be send up to another state, where your citizens are -- and the shippers and the whole economies is going to have to subsidies the commuters in Fairfield County, Connecticut to get to the jobs and rival New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="7175.087" offset="28803741">Any merger of this type is very damaging to the citizens of Pennsylvania and the fact that the Commonwealth and the City of Philadelphia, City of Pittsburgh, do their act of opposition indicates the pressure or not the pressure but the influence of the Pennsylvania Railroad and not that the witnesses, these expert witnesses at the Commonwealth put on are anyway wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="7197.659" offset="28894020">I might say, it's quite Mr. Keyserling already mention it, the Department of Justice, two-and-a-half years ago filed a 270-page brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="7207.643" offset="28933935">Opposing this merger in its entirety, 270 pages and on the basis of that 270-page brief, they made an argument and all argument 14 months to go in complete opposition of this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="7219.241" offset="28980328">And I still don't know eventhough he's on the same side what United States thinks about the appeals raised by Mr. Shapp or City of Scranton.</text>
            <text syncTime="7226.497" offset="29009377">They've deferred any comment on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7228.101" offset="29015751">They have footnotes on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7229.090" offset="29019721">We don't know what their position is.</text>
            <text syncTime="7230.710" offset="29026200">We'd like to know why.</text>
            <text syncTime="7233.419" offset="29037066">Well, maybe they won't take a position but we don't know why the Department of Justice isn't still fighting this merger because certainly today is less -- there is much less justification for it than it was before.</text>
            <text syncTime="7246.485" offset="29089311">Now, I like to talk a little bit about a word that hasn't been mention and that's the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="7250.717" offset="29106239">And the basic legal reason why we think this merger is erroneous was that the ICC, deploy -- employed the test of the Transportation Act of 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="7259.462" offset="29141243">The test that you construed in 1932 in the New York City Security Corporation tests, but that test is out of date in our judgment because the Transportation Act of 1940 which is construed in McLean decision pose that they're different criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="7274.417" offset="29201011">But before it was a judicially construed for criteria the public interest which is 1932 are now statutory and these four criteria are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="7282.141" offset="29231940">And the Commission has not considered the impact of this merger upon the employees of railroads that it will be heard by employees of Erie-Lackawanna, D &amp; H, C &amp; J instead the fourth criteria doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="7296.042" offset="29287528">It's not that to -- it's too remote.</text>
            <text syncTime="7299.344" offset="29300799">Yet, it's very remote from security holders, I mean its remote for the security holders of these railroads they get elaborate conditions that's suppose to be included indemnity, all sorts of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="7310.037" offset="29343535">Yet the employees are not to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="7314.540" offset="29361507">We don't know what the total fix charges are going to be from this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="7317.432" offset="29373106">If that's specific criteria at the present Section 5 (2) of the Act because the New Haven -- we don't know what the price of the New Haven is going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="7326.182" offset="29408110">Then we have the National Defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="7328.173" offset="29416051">They didn't solicit testimony from the Department of Defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="7331.177" offset="29428067">Yet, we -- here we are at war in Vietnam and we're going to have a drastic collapse in railroad facilities at budgeting ton miles from the present 89 billion according to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="7340.577" offset="29465684">66 billion or 64 billion have tremendous drop in traffic or the defense implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="7345.461" offset="29485223">Yet the national transportation policy exists today or did not exist in 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="7351.879" offset="29510928">We have according to the opinion of McLean to look at other legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7356.180" offset="29528064">We have the passenger train Discontinuance Act of 1958 which says that the shippers afraid are not to subsidized passenger service.</text>
            <text syncTime="7362.892" offset="29554918">If what else is this New Haven inclusion?</text>
            <text syncTime="7365.530" offset="29565471">We have the Commission saying that the impact of this merger on towns and communities with respect to employment, taxation, and local businesses is not to be included at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="7373.553" offset="29597550">It's irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="7374.538" offset="29601520">When we have hundreds of communities that have opposed this merger, hundreds of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="7378.164" offset="29616044">You look and examine the report and even though they're not here today, they are in opposition and to suggest in view of the Appalachian Regional Development Act which involved City of Scranton, it was in it, means it doesn't apply that we could just have a merger and not even consider employment or taxation were the effect on local business.</text>
            <text syncTime="7398.580" offset="29697651">So our main point, I'd like to leave with you is that the standard which the Commission used in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7404.787" offset="29722520">The New York Central Security's Corporation test as they referred on in the briefs to you is just erroneous as the matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="7412.881" offset="29754911">The last thing I like to briefly mention is competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="7416.903" offset="29771003">And in addition to not considering the addressed impact on these other railroads as part of the competition to be appraised and the lost of service to towns like Scranton by inclusion in the Norfolk and Western System.</text>
            <text syncTime="7429.962" offset="29823248">The Commission failed to include market competition and that derives from the opinion that in the Seaboard case a year ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="7436.944" offset="29851146">And this in some thought the transportation standards rather than the Brown Shoes standard should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="7442.175" offset="29872044">Well, if transportation standards are involved, we have them at the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="7445.785" offset="29886464">We have market competition and carrier corporate competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="7448.509" offset="29897435">We have them for a number of Section 7 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="7450.864" offset="29906840">But the Commission is going to appraise the extent of competition they're going to use market competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="7454.654" offset="29921991">An example of that is Wheat Cargo Co.</text>
            <text syncTime="7457.236" offset="29932335">How about the basing point decisions?</text>
            <text syncTime="7458.803" offset="29938604">The cement industry up in the Lehigh Hudson Valley District versus the Cement Industry in Pennsylvania in the Hudson -- in the Lehigh District both of these two cement producing areas located on different railroads competing for common markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="7471.615" offset="29989804">Commission holds as a matter of law in this report on reconsideration that this competition need not be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="7478.889" offset="30018957">Well, in our judgment this merger should be anulled and set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="7482.798" offset="30034526">I'd like to leave some time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="7495.295" offset="30084577">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7501.265" offset="30108400">The position of the United States Government is that the United States is concerned in this case primarily with the question of sound administrative procedures in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="7515.773" offset="30166497">And the possible harm caused by the Commission's departure from such procedure that all of these might be pulled a smaller yet essential railroads in the East, notably the three-railroad everybody has been talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="7534.118" offset="30239848">The question in our mind is that some procedure would require the Commission to withhold the immediate consummation of this particular one Penn-Central merger because in particular effect, that accomplishes an irreversible event before attempting to solve the great problems which the merger would create for the smaller railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="7562.077" offset="30351653">We rely very heavily on Judge Weinfeld's dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="7569.960" offset="30383208">Starts on 840 in the B &amp; O's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="7575.733" offset="30406301">And he points out one thing that this is very difficult to each time of this argument to find something that hasn't been said.</text>
            <text syncTime="7585.590" offset="30445693">But Judge Weinfeld on 44 put some stress on the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="7590.598" offset="30465755">Then in the Commission's quote, “statutory findings and ultimate conclusions”, it points out these needs for these railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="7602.261" offset="30512462">And when you read that in conjunction with the conclusion they made that this would not work unless the three railroads were protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="7616.981" offset="30571290">I agree that this was a condition precedent and once the Commission adopted that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7625.941" offset="30607130">It was not the normal procedure to go back and take out the particular appendices.</text>
            <text syncTime="7635.010" offset="30643388">After Commission had adopted this Appendix G, which they called protective condition for Erie-Lackawanna, Delaware and Hudson in Boston and Maine, the Commission itself considered this necessary and made it quite clear that without them, the Commission stated that would not authorize immediate consummation of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="7662.317" offset="30752684">And despite what appears in all of the briefs of appellees that United States raised the point that they never raised before, United States Government did raise it in the petition for reconsideration before the Commission itself that's one of the places it was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="7682.037" offset="30831470">And it appears on page 17 of the exemption filed by the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="7688.122" offset="30855816">If the Commission determines to approve this merger, a minimum condition of such approval should be that consummation be delayed for at least 18 months in order to give the Erie, D &amp; M, and D &amp; H time to apply for the inclusion in the N &amp; W system and C &amp; O system are in until actual inclusion in either is effectuated if the latter should become sooner.</text>
            <text syncTime="7716.259" offset="30968456">I take the position that the appellees take which is at the United States' Government has no right to comment on a merger of this type which they the same breadth say, it's the largest merger that would ever occur and it is the most urgent one that would ever occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="7740.065" offset="31063646">I think the United States Government still has the right as a party to present its side.</text>
            <text syncTime="7748.050" offset="31095620">And in these particular exemptions that we file, we pointed to the Commission had acquiesced to the failure of those two rail system to present evidence of the adverse effect of the Penn-Central merger on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="7766.696" offset="31170121">Notwithstanding that on the separate proceeding these very railroads would rely on the change and the competitive balance in the northeast represented by the Penn-Central merger to support their own merger application, especially if the smaller roads were not included in the Norfolk and Western system.</text>
            <text syncTime="7790.301" offset="31264580">As has been noted however, the Commission decline to delay consummation of Penn-Central merger without giving the reason and the District Court declined to preserve the status quo pending judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="7806.012" offset="31327378">The majority opinion by Judge Friendly seem to put great emphasis on what could be done in the future and also emphasis on rightfully so on the New Haven railroad but to the exclusion of the other problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="7820.877" offset="31386833">Now, the District Court by refusing to enjoin the merger, in effect ascended to the Commission's procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="7828.841" offset="31418702">Once the merger is consummated, some of the principal issues raised will be mooted and that goes for most of the argument this morning when to put on detail as to each one of these three railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="7841.703" offset="31470216">Before discussing the procedure the Commission itself, I wish to emphasize that the United States does not oppose the Penn-Central merger itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="7852.389" offset="31512952">So long as the merger can be effected with adequate concern for and protection of the three smaller roads that were most keenly feel its effects, the so-called offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="9099.855" offset="36502758">We contend that the court below correctly decided both of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="9104.566" offset="36521671">We believe that the court below correctly refused to enjoin consummation of the Penn-Central merger until the problems of all the Eastern railroads could be worked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="9116.707" offset="36570154">Now, some of the appellants seem to be withdrawing from that position but that's what they put in their briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="9123.099" offset="36595754">And secondly, we contend that the court below correctly refused to stay consummation of the merger while the Commission had a limited further proceeding and interim protective conditions for Erie-Lackawanna, Delaware and Hudson, and Boston and Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="9142.125" offset="36671822">Perhaps it'd be useful to review briefly the pattern of related proceedings and the pattern of participation of these various appellants in those proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="9155.068" offset="36723649">In 1962, the Commission authorized C &amp; O to acquire control of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and at that time, by getting them the Commission was rejecting suggestions from the Department of Justice and other persons for consolidation of the C &amp; O, B &amp; O proceeding with the Norfolk and Western-Nickel Plate and Penn-Central proceedings which were just getting underway.</text>
            <text syncTime="9183.219" offset="36836289">B &amp; O owns a 38% voting interest in the Reading and the Reading in turn controls Central New Jersey to ownership of 49% of its stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="9196.829" offset="36890728">It should also be noted that C &amp; O and B &amp; O are the beneficial owners of 65% of the voting stock of Western Maryland and that they now have pending an application before the Commission for authority to assume actual control of Western Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="9213.376" offset="36956871">So if all of the railroad appellants except Erie-Lackawanna, Delaware and Hudson, Boston and Maine all have close ties.</text>

            <text syncTime="9252.939" offset="37115173">The Nickel Plate it takes over the extensive Wabash by lease and some related but still significant transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="9263.712" offset="37158222">The effect was to extend Norfolk and Western from a regional coal line with its western terminal line in Ohio to a much larger system reaching to Chicago, Dumont, Peoria and Saint Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="9280.384" offset="37224887">Then a little bit more than regional coal carrying railroad now.</text>
            <text syncTime="9286.494" offset="37249337">In the Norfolk and Western-Nickel Plate proceeding, Erie-Lackawanna petitioned that during hearings that pursuant to Section 5 (2) (d) of the Interstate Commerce Act that it be included in the Norfolk and Western-Nickel Plate System.</text>
            <text syncTime="9302.872" offset="37314853">And similar petitions were filed by Delaware and Hudson and by Boston and Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="9309.971" offset="37343274">During the hearings, Erie-Lackawanna withdrew its petition for inclusion for various reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="9317.756" offset="37374412">One of which was admittedly, is a very poor financial position was admittedly to improve its earning position and posture if possible and therefore have a better bargaining position with Norfolk and Western on the terms of inclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="9335.374" offset="37444838">So that meant that the Delaware and Hudson, and Boston and Maine lacking a physical connection with Norfolk and Western since Erie-Lackawanna have got out that meant that their inclusion at that time was impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="9350.358" offset="37504815">But the Commission recognized that while those three lines were also petitioning for inclusion of the Penn-Central system.</text>
            <text syncTime="9360.523" offset="37545462">But there was an obvious reasons, competitive reasons generally recognizing the industry that it might well be probable -- probably would be probable for those three carriers to be included in the Norfolk and Western system.</text>
            <text syncTime="9378.521" offset="37617455">So it provided in condition of this -- of its order approving Norfolk and Western-Nickel Plate merger that for a period of five years, anyone of those three lines could file an application for inclusion in the Norfolk and Western system upon terms to be -- to be prescribed by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="9400.848" offset="37706794">And that condition provided that consummation by Nickel -- by Norfolk and Western-Nickel Plate of any transaction approved here in that is there own merger shall constitute on the part of such applicants, acquiescence in and irrevocable ascent to a condition stated in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="9420.281" offset="37784534">Thereafter that merger was consummated without any person seeking judicial review of that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="9429.017" offset="37819434">Later Erie-Lackawanna, Delaware and Hudson, and Boston and Maine pursuant to the condition had filed the petitions for inclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="9457.229" offset="37932283">As to Boston and Maine, he would not require inclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="9515.559" offset="38165608">When the last big card was laid in the table in October 1965, when the Norfolk and Western and C &amp; O filed to the Commission an application for approval of their merger. That would be the Nor -- the old Norfolk -- with the Norfol and Western-Nickel Plate plus the C &amp; O and B &amp; O combination into a single system.</text>
            <text syncTime="9540.518" offset="38265396">And they offered to include on specified terms which have not yet been accepted, Erie-Lackawanna, Delaware and Hudson, Boston and Maine, the Reading, and the Central New Jersey, all of the orphans.</text>
            <text syncTime="9555.627" offset="38325896">Of course it was subject to significant conditions -- qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="9559.681" offset="38342092">One, being modification of present federal tax law to permit Norfolk and Western to obtain the benefit of the operating laws carry overs of the Erie-Lackawanna, Boston and Maine, Reading and Central New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="9573.462" offset="38397262">Now those would have a tax value of something in the dimension of a $100 million or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="9581.155" offset="38427982">So you can see that while this latest merger plan which would include all five of the so-called orphan lines were considerably it maybe found that be in the public interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="10624.222" offset="42600260">These appellants filed a various petitions for reconsideration in the Commission's report and order.</text>
            <text syncTime="10630.279" offset="42624502">I would like to refer a layer to the extent that which their petitions did not raised the contentions which they now present to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="10637.169" offset="42652087">But for present purposes, it should be noted that all of the railroad appellants requested opportunity for a hearing on the admittedly noble interim protective conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="10649.417" offset="42700988">So on the commission's report on reconsideration September 1966, the Commission did two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="10656.056" offset="42727633">It reopened the proceedings for further hearings limited to this special traffic and indemnity provisions in Appendix G.</text>
            <text syncTime="10666.172" offset="42768071">It provided that the traffic conditions would remain in effect assuming a consummation until change after hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="10674.648" offset="42801925">It rescinded the indemnity condition but provided that any indemnity provision which might be devised would be imposed retroactive to the date of the consummation of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="10690.092" offset="42863783">At the same time, notwithstanding its action in reopening the proceeding for further hearing on the traffic and indemnity conditions, the Commission concluded that the public interest requires prompt consummation of the proposed merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="10708.494" offset="42937344">Now, the complaints have been filed in the court below before the Commission had issues report on reconsideration and with that report issued, the principal issue and the view of the court below was whether the Commission had authorized in erring cons -- in authorizing consummation of the merger while conducting these further hearings on special commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="10731.347" offset="43028773">In a detailed analysis, the court below held that the Commission had not heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="10737.691" offset="43054164">Secondarily, although little argued in the court below, the court below held that was no merit in contentions that consummation of the merger should be deferred until conclusion of all pending rail merger proceedings relating to the Northeastern United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="10760.014" offset="43143398">Turning to the position of the Department of Justice, they tell the Court that the agencies are the executive branch that had substantive responsibilities for the formulation of economic and transportation policies, believe that the merger is in the public interest and that its consummation should be promptly affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="10779.774" offset="43222497">They point out that the railroad industry of the Northeast is an urgent need of rapid modernization and believe that as a practical matter, substantial consolidation among existing systems will be necessary to achieve this end.</text>
            <text syncTime="10798.736" offset="43298356">Thus, those federal agencies enjoin the States of Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts in supporting this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="10808.238" offset="43336286">It is unprecedented support for such a transaction by public bodies responsible to the welfare of the large segments of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="10823.362" offset="43396786">It is clear that the department is urging delay and consummation until the Commission determines the inclusion petitions of Erie-Lackawanna, Delaware and Hudson, and Boston and Maine for inclusion of Norfolk and Western.</text>
            <text syncTime="10838.497" offset="43457390">We have been uncertain, I still am, as to whether they are also urging delay until the Commission determines the Norfolk and Western, C &amp; O merger application and the precise terms and until it determines the precise terms for the inclusion of New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="10857.010" offset="43531368">Because that the more of those things you will put in as a bar to consummation, the more we are talking about years.</text>
            <text syncTime="10864.203" offset="43560208">Just the -- not just the few friendly months, we're talking about years.</text>
            <text syncTime="10871.937" offset="43591137">In any event at that point the Department says, “This Court should not now decide whether the Commission and the court below were in error”.</text>
            <text syncTime="10881.225" offset="43628231">There is just at this Commission hold the case while the Commission completes the related proceedings so that this Court won't have to decide, the case now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10894.676" offset="43682043">And it seems to us that I -- they requested really which ask this Court to simply stay consummation on the merger without determining whether the court below erred in refusing it to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="10908.893" offset="43738990">But at that point, the Court is asking -- the Department is asking this Court to engage in the administrative and non-judicial function of regulating the Commission's docket.</text>
            <text syncTime="10921.116" offset="43787786">So that the things that this Court has repeatedly held that the Court should not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="10926.189" offset="43808162">We submit that the Commission and the many parties and indeed the court below are entitled to a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="10935.587" offset="43845674">And there is no doubt at all particularly in the reply briefs that the railroad appellants in Number 642, Norfolk and Western et al. and the Central New Jersey in its reply brief, although it had the original brief are now asking this Court to hold that approval and consummation of the Penn-Central merger must be deferred until a solution is found for all the lines in the East.</text>

            <text syncTime="11047.882" offset="44294875">Now, certainly the whole posture of this litigation strongly suggests that no matter what the Commission proscribes, one -- one of these carrier factions will take it to Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="11058.324" offset="44336671">So the next question will be to the merger be -- accept consummation be further deferred until judicial review of the interim protected conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="11068.201" offset="44376168">Then secondly, that's only the first half of the court ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="11071.441" offset="44389125">They say, that the consummation should be deferred clearly until the inclusion of Erie-Lackawanna, Delaware and Hudson, Boston and Maine is settled and presumably with judicial review of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="11086.958" offset="44451192">There is -- there's just no way we -- anybody can be sure that this merger could possibly go into -- that this -- that the delay of consummation involved in differing it until the Commission comes out to its report on this interim special conditions would involved only a few months.</text>

            <text syncTime="11229.313" offset="45020662">On the other hand the Commission pointed out, that we're talking about the interim protection now, not the long wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="11236.258" offset="45048456">Commission pointed out that putting together a merger of this size is a vast complex and slow task.</text>
            <text syncTime="11245.090" offset="45083773">For example, Mr. White depressed in the Erie-Lackawanna in speaking with the further authority of a former Vice President of New York Central, so he had seen both side of this competitive relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="11259.731" offset="45142288">He testified to the Commission even before the Commission had announced any interim protective conditions that would be the second year before a Penn-Central merger could have a significant impact upon Erie-Lackawanna, that it would have no effect of the first year so that there -- so that these conditions don't have to be affected the first day at the consummation of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="11286.846" offset="45250748">Secondly, Penn-Central have pledged themselves not to seek judicial review of the Appendix G conditions which the Commission have revised.</text>

            <text syncTime="11306.001" offset="45327339">They have not waived judicial review on capital -- on indemnity for capital loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="11311.889" offset="45350954">Result is that in a fairly short period of time, certainly this spring or early summer.</text>
            <text syncTime="11318.032" offset="45375509">As far as the Commission and Penn-Central are concerned, a set of protective condition can be in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="11325.154" offset="45404035">Now, perhaps others can go to Court and get them stayed that as far as the applicants and the Commission are concerned, there will be a set of conditions in effect long before this merger could have a real competitive bite.</text>
            <text syncTime="11343.158" offset="45476028">Secondly, there is no principle of law that anyone of these appellant railroads has to be guaranteed 100% protection against diversion of traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="11353.414" offset="45516988">As the court below said, what they're entitled to is protection against such diversion of traffic as will impair their viability, their ability to provide adequate service to their service areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="11367.874" offset="45574875">Erie-Lackawanna has testify -- has advised the Commission in its reply brief, in the inclusion proceeding that it is confident that the Commission can device reasonable -- reasonably adequate protective conditions.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert W. Ginnane</label>
            <text syncTime="11416.792" offset="45770585">Is -- it would be on a scale the only fraction of the merger savings because the indemnity would be phrased not in terms of a reduction in gross revenues but the reduction in net earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="11431.006" offset="45827427">And we're talking about a sum which even is applied to all three railroads would be a few million dollars a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="11438.543" offset="45857520">A small fraction of the merger savings and that's why Penn-Central are so confident of that, that's why they committed themselves to accept the -- any temporary indemnity provision that they know what's a manageable sum that's involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="11455.568" offset="45925648">One brief point sir, the Norfolk and Western C -- Central of New Jersey group of appellants, C &amp; O and B &amp; O, are insist -- have been urging before the lower court and this court that any kind of indemnity provision if adopted will create a community of interest between Erie-Lackawanna, Delaware and Hudson, and Boston and Maine on the one hand and a merged Penn-Central on the other hand which will cause them to divert traffic to each other and away from Norfolk and Western, C &amp; J and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="11495.531" offset="46085517">This to which they now attach which they view as such great alarm was not even mentioned by C &amp; J and Norfolk and Western in their petitions for reconsideration to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="11511.434" offset="46149151">From which I conclude and it was barely mentioned by C &amp; O, B &amp; O from which I conclude that since they have so recently foreseen the stature that it must be one with which the Commission can cope in the formulation of conditions after a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="11527.807" offset="46214562">And one further point on the efficacy of these conditions to protect these three carriers pending consummation of this merger and their inclusion in another system and this might -- frankly, this might be more important in the right to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="11545.169" offset="46284048">They will be subject to constant revision by the Commission on the light experience pursuant to Section 5 (9) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="11553.765" offset="46318425">Admittedly, they're noble and we might learn quite a good deal by experience with them as we go along.</text>
            <text syncTime="11560.504" offset="46345383">And the Commission would have to retain jurisdiction to modify those conditions to ensure that they give adequate protection to the three without causing undue injury to the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="11578.842" offset="46418735">I would like to discuss very seriously, the other issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="11584.931" offset="46443081">It's been muted today but it's here and that is that consummation of this merger should be deferred not merely until protected conditions are prescribed in a few months by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="11597.589" offset="46493759">But that consummation should be deferred until act -- until the inclusion of the three protected lines and is finally determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="11610.885" offset="46546944">Thank you.</text>
