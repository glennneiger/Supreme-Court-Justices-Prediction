            <text syncTime="743.092" offset="3075741">Now it seems to me that if the right under the Sixth Amendment to be confronted by the witnesses, which means the right to have counsel there to cross-examine, is intertwined with the right to counsel and if compulsory process is necessary to get the witnesses there to have a fair trial, then it is just as implicit in any concept of ordered liberty as the right of confrontation as so held in Pointer against Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.547" offset="3197576">Now, as to the results in this case, it does not make any difference whether we approach this case strictly under the Fourteenth Amendment, due process, the right to be heard, the right to make a fair defense as applied in this particular case or whether we approach it that the Sixth Amendment provisions of the right to compulsory process is incorporated and obligatory against the State of Texas by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.738" offset="3302275">Now I feel that my opponent, by reading their brief, would possibly err that the recent opinion of Spencer against Texas may have something to do with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.427" offset="3341040">I seriously challenge that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.092" offset="3351698">I think Spencer against Texas, the majority opinion simply holds that where element is relevant to a conviction under the prosecution under the habitual criminal statute that where a relevant evidence is admissible, though it is harmful and damaging to the accused it is not of constitutional dimension.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.399" offset="3428916">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="832.099" offset="3431737">Because there was no provision pointed out in Spencer against Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.831" offset="3446680">Implicitly in the bill of rights, there was no ex -- implicit constitutional provision violated in Spencer against Texas and this Court held in majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.666" offset="3486072">And I think with sound reasoning, with all due difference to the dissent that in trials of this nature, some prejudice is bound to occur to the defendant in the admission of relevant testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.024" offset="3539466">We might get to the point to where bloody pictures were relevant could be so bad that the accused would contend they violate process.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.075" offset="3571649">But I think that here we have a horse of a different coat.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.732" offset="3586278">And in my humble opinion, Pointer against Texas, Gideon against Wainwright, the sound reasoning of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Robinson v. Pate, the viciousness of this statute which is aimed against, but which says the man is not interested, the codefendant if he is called by the state even though he has been tried and convicted or untried, that he can testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.669" offset="3678020">But the only way the defendant under that statute could use this witness was to make a false accusation.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.900" offset="3702993">Now what would the defendant have to do to use Fuller, the codefendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.056" offset="3719607">He would have to file a false affidavit that Fuller was not guilty and that there was not sufficient evidence to convict Fuller, and that Fuller should be first tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.784" offset="3758477">Then and only then if Fuller was tried and acquitted could petitioner use that witness.Because -- not make this false affidavit, Fuller was guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.778" offset="3798497">The only other way he could use Fuller's evidence was this -- was if the State of Texas would wait 50 years or until the man was released and had satisfied his conviction then he could be called or if the prosecution were dismissed.</text>

            <text syncTime="952.150" offset="3911973">First, I would like to start to -- get the ground rule straight here.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.065" offset="3927646">I understood from the papers we had all filed that we will here today to discuss the question of whether or not the right to compulsory production witnesses was to be discuss here.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.359" offset="3980831">And I hope I'm prepared to discuss that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.422" offset="4001102">I'm not so well prepared to simply go into general rules on the Fourteenth Amendment because my instructions from this Court whether to respond on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.144" offset="4035897">And I don't feel that compulsory process has meant to violate it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.447" offset="4053138">The witness that he wanted was available right there in the Dallas County Jail and could have been used at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.702" offset="4078216">He did not issue a subpoena and the sheriff refused to serve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.238" offset="4096293">The man was there available but he was prevented by an evidentiary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.965" offset="4115205">He was an incompetent witness in the same manner as an idiot, a lunatic, or a drunkard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.698" offset="4134118">Because our state law says that he was an incompetent witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.632" offset="4153866">And I don't think that rule would mean any different if he had issued a subpoena and brought immediately into the Court and the state objected to the testimony of an idiot or lunatic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.979" offset="4195244">And the Court had, right properly under the statutes, excluded such testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.791" offset="4214575">As true, the idiot may have been a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.018" offset="4223457">He may have been sitting around somewhere where he could see what was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.161" offset="4239966">But there would be no question of the failure of the Sixth Amendment to provide him with compulsory process just because the Court said that idiot cannot testify.</text>
