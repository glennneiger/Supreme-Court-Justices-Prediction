            <text syncTime="122.140" offset="488490">If they decide that they want to have the body elected, presumably it's supposed to represent the constituency that's electing it.</text>

            <text syncTime="193.035" offset="772075">I think the difficulty has to do with setting up some workable criteria.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.655" offset="834560">It seems to me that a rule that would subscribe only bodies exercising something like substantial or important or basic governmental powers could be evolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.957" offset="907807">But the problem of trying to apply that rule in each individual case it seems to me would be a never ending one.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.117" offset="984398">Well, it seems to me that if the state of a local body decides that its members are going to be elected and they're going to be elected from districts, then they've made a judgment that that body is intended to be representative of the electorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.054" offset="1060153">And if they feel that it's important enough to handle it that way and the people feel that it's important enough to handle it that way, then I'd be inclined to think that the Court should go along with that judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1302.885" offset="5211533">The 300 cases, I believe the Court is fully apprised of the -- let me say unusual circumstances, unique circumstances in the Sailors case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.656" offset="5258553">I'm sure the Court understands thoroughly the constitutional questions that we raised.</text>

            <text syncTime="1323.999" offset="5295961">The Solicitor General says that to the fact of the question which unfortunately is in our case, is constitutionally insignificant and we certainly agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.402" offset="5341518">The difficulty is that the appellants have brought it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.915" offset="5355624">It is one of their claims or relief that the transfer which triggered this litigation, the transfer by the Kent County Board of Education, two Kentwood public schools that I represent (Inaudible) public schools is void.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.315" offset="5417169">And the relief I ask that this Court set that transfer aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.570" offset="5438276">Now, that means six and a half million dollars of valuation to my school district client and the fourteen room modern schoolhouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.925" offset="5471608">The three judges in the District Court were unanimous that at least the body was a de facto body and that the transfer should stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.441" offset="5517688">Now, whatever else happened in Sailors in Number 430?</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.397" offset="5537541">I urged the Court to say that they affirm the three judges of the District Court and place -- prevent the transfer to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.217" offset="5576829">One last word, we urged that a constitutionally apportioned legislature is more competent to determine the method of selecting its numerous diverse board or agencies in selecting the membership of it in peculiar circumstances that may exist and change from time to time in the state than any court.</text>
