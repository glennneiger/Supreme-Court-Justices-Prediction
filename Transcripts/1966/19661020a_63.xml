            <text syncTime="24.761" offset="202376">The sole issue that is presented in this case is whether a bank which honors the checks of a depositor is to be held responsible to a trustee in bankruptcy or the depositor if the bank honored the checks after the depositor has filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy and where the bank had no notice of the bankruptcy.</text>

            <text syncTime="60.660" offset="346049">The facts are virtually undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.456" offset="361200">Between August 27th and September 17th 1963, Marin Seafoods drew and delivered five checks on its commercial count with the Bank of Marin.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.226" offset="412296">These checks were delivered to Eureka Fisheries.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.680" offset="434134">On September 26th, 1963, Marin Seafoods filed a voluntary petition of bankruptcy in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.951" offset="471228">Four days later, John M. England was appointed receiver and on October 20th, 1963, he became the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.074" offset="511666">On October 2nd, 1963, the checks which had previously been drawn and delivered were presented by Eureka Fisheries to the bank for payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.530" offset="557537">As of this date, the bank had no notice and no knowledge for the bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.206" offset="576240">There were sufficient funds on deposit.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.970" offset="587212">The bank therefore honored the checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.462" offset="601213">Subsequently, the trustee applied to the referee in bankruptcy for a turnover order.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.723" offset="626291">The referee held that the bank and the payee of those checks were jointly responsible to the trustee for the amount of the checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.812" offset="670595">Subsequently the payee paid the judgment and has now sought contribution against the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.689" offset="706121">After that occurred the bank petition for review in the District Court ultimately appealed to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.951" offset="739140">In the Court of Appeals, it was held that the lack of notice afforded no protection to the bank because of the wording of Section 70a and 70d of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.025" offset="803506">As the contention of the petitioner, Bank of Marin that the application of these two Sections of the Bankruptcy Act by the Court of the Appeals violates due process in two regards.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.941" offset="863169">Firstly, it's requiring the bank who had previously satisfied its obligation to its depositor to satisfy this obligation without notice a second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.938" offset="923146">As a part of that same contention is the second question is that the bank is being compelled to pay the same debt twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.185" offset="960136">When the checks were originally presented for payment the bank was discharging its legal obligation to its depositor by honoring the checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.202" offset="1000155">If the bank is to be compelled to satisfy this obligation again to the trustee, we contend that the bank is in fact being compelled -- pay twice.</text>

            <text syncTime="240.755" offset="1066402">The -- in addition to our constitutional argument, we feel that the Bankruptcy Act can there -- very reasonably be construed to protect the bank and that this Court need not rule on the constitution argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.663" offset="1130036">We feel firstly that Section 70d(5), the last sentence in that particular Section which provides that nothing in this Title shall impair negotiability, or currency or negotiable instruments.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.617" offset="1193880">We feel that that particular provision forged the bank protection under the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.614" offset="1233795">There is very little that we could find that informed us as what Congress specifically intended when they enacted particular provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.566" offset="1281651">I think that reason dictates that Congress must have had in mind a drawee bank when their particular savings cost was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.480" offset="1321253">The drawee bank is the party that is most frequently going to be involved in the negotiation of checks or in the cashing of checks or negotiable instruments when bankruptcy is involved.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="319.251" offset="1380394">Now, what you say strikes me as correct, as a matter of fact in -- that's the reason I'm surprised that there has not been a lot more case law development of this question, do you have any suggestions to why not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Edgar B. Washburn</label>
            <text syncTime="332.066" offset="1431594">I think as a practical manner Your Honor, what happened was that prior to 1959, there was a time period between the moment of the filing of a voluntary petition of bankruptcy in between -- in the ultimate adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.962" offset="1491257">Other provision to Section 70d would afford protection to a bank during that particular time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.734" offset="1518320">In 1959, the Act was amended so that adjudication became automatic upon the filing of a voluntary petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.054" offset="1555623">This was to affect more as a procedural change to relieve the District Court judges of the burden of having to pass on every single voluntary petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.304" offset="1588537">But it did have the effect of making adjudication automatic.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.027" offset="1607450">With that time period gone, there -- no longer was any time between bankruptcy and adjudication during which the banks could acquire notice and in the past as a practical manner, banks did get notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.918" offset="1659068">The trustee would phone them up.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.180" offset="1664084">They'd receive a letter and in fact they probably would have gotten notice in this situation such as this where ultimately the bank did get notice in the form of a letter from the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.256" offset="1696371">So I think that explains the reasons for the lack of litigation --</text>

            <label>Mr. Edgar B. Washburn</label>
            <text syncTime="404.286" offset="1720508">Yes, and as pointed out by the amicus curie in this particular case, since this decision in the Ninth Circuit that the Bank of America has had six similar incidents and the Bank of Marin, I know is, has had one.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.977" offset="1779231">So that we feel that there is significant burden that's being placed on the banks by reasoning of this particular ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.524" offset="1829491">Referring back again to the negotiability proviso of Section 70d(5), I think it is clear that the drawee bank was intended to be protected.If the drawee bank is not protected, there is virtually no one who is going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.477" offset="1889259">The payee of a check generally will be either a preferred creditor or it will be a fraudulent transfer if the transfer occurs so close to bankruptcy that the checks are going to be presented afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.907" offset="1942967">Certainly, possibly other subsequent holders from the payee might be able to for protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.098" offset="1963760">But the two people that are most intimately involved are going to be most frequently involved would be the payee and the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.838" offset="1990719">The payee as I mentioned probably won't be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.328" offset="2000645">The bank by the decision of the Court of Appeals cannot be protected.</text>

            <text syncTime="509.820" offset="2142647">Possibly, I think as a matter of fact in this particular incident -- incidence, the payee here was a trade creditor and the delivery of the check to the payee was a preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.549" offset="2189563">And although this was not the basis for the referee's decision, I think that the payee would have to return the funds to the trustee in any event.</text>

            <text syncTime="569.119" offset="2379839">I would say so Your Honor although there is -- I think, there is one distinction, banks are in the peculiar situation of dealing with deposits, dealing with vast numbers of checks everyday.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.379" offset="2424874">So that the burden that is placed upon a bank to keep itself advised is to whether or not a depositor, any given depositor has gone into bankruptcy is virtually impossible whereas an individual payee who is receiving a check from one person could conceivably in a great deal easier than the bank find out whether this particular person was the subject of bankruptcy.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="605.836" offset="2526751">That would really go to the likelihood -- the question whether the payee would have knowledge or not but it would not affect a legal principle involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="619.275" offset="2580459">In addition to the negotiability proviso that I have just mentioned, I also appeal that the Bankruptcy Act is susceptible to affording protection to the bank on the basis of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.839" offset="2650676">The Court of Appeals held that the numerous decisions of this Court and other lower courts that were handed prior to 1938 have no application here because Section 70d undertakes to set forth all of the transactions that are to be protected after the filing of a petition of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.682" offset="2758092">The Court of Appeals also noted in another portion of their opinion that Section 70d in fact has no application to a voluntary bankruptcy because Section 70d applies only in the interval after the filing of a voluntary petition and before adjudication or before a receiver takes possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.870" offset="2850879">In the situation of a voluntary petition, there is no such interval so that is virtually impossible whether there ever be any instance when Section 70d can apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.223" offset="2904273">We agree with that particular interpretation of Section 70d except insofar as it relates to the negotiability proviso of Section 70d(5).</text>
            <text syncTime="711.252" offset="2948368">That proviso I think on its phase is not so limited in that it says that nothing in this Title shall impair instruments or currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.820" offset="2990686">And by this Title, it's referring to Title 11 of the U.S. Code which is the Bankruptcy Act in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.136" offset="3015868">So we feel that 70(d) in that particular regard is not limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.845" offset="3034781">However as to the other provisions of Section 70d, it is our position that they have virtually no application in a sit -- in a voluntary bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.100" offset="3087757">There is therefore no specific provision in the Bankruptcy Act dealing with what transactions are to receive protection after the filing of a voluntary petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1664.516" offset="6761409">I'd like to begin by responding to the questions that were asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.309" offset="6776560">I think that first one that I should respond to is the question of contribution under California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.920" offset="6807071">I would take issue with the position taken by the petitioner in his reply brief in which he cites a number of cases which set forth the existence of a right to contribution in favor of a joint obligor under a judgment who has satisfied the judgment against other obligors on the judgment who have not paid any share of the judgment to the cases or the cases universally set forth the proposition is that the person seeking contribution is entitled to recover from the nonpaying obligor his proportionate share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.151" offset="6980002">They don't say one half or a fractional share equal to the number of parties involved in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.510" offset="7005393">They say his proportionate share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.909" offset="7015006">And two the case cited by the petitioner, Davis against Heimbach involved a case where execution was issued without any showing whatsoever on the part of the paying judgment obligor seeking contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.973" offset="7087313">It simply applied to the court for a writ of execution and it was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.848" offset="7106748">That was reversed on the ground that there has to be a showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.473" offset="7129213">There has to be a notice and opportunity for a hearing before contribution can be issued against the nonpaying joint obligor on a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.806" offset="7166621">A second case illustrates this equally well, this was Starz (ph) against Fletcher where after a hearing the court issued a execution in favor of the party seeking contribution against the nonpaying party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.653" offset="7246033">But the order contained no finding, no basis for a judicial conclusion that a contribution was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.657" offset="7281977">And again the appellate court found that you have to make some positive showing as to what the proportionate share of the nonpaying joint obligor on the judgment is.</text>
