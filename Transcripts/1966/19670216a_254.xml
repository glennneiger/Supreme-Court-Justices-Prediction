            <text syncTime="21.071" offset="187643">I would like briefly to go over the relevant facts as it relates to the questions before the Court in this case and the two proceedings cases highlighting those factual matters in which the three cases that you have on this general lineup question to some extent differ, it may involve different rules of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.816" offset="290670">Essentially what happened here was that a homicide took place in the early morning of -- in a rural community -- urban community, New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.442" offset="349184">The next day, Stovall was taken into custody, went through a lengthy interrogation throughout the rest of the day and night and the following morning was arraigned upon a complaint charging a capital offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.422" offset="425044">After that arraignment at which he was not offered -- assigned counsel, after that arraignment, he was then taken back to the police station where probably nothing much transpired and then to the hospital room where the wife of the victim was then under treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.966" offset="527235">In that hospital room, the wife of the victim who became the identifying witness at the trial was with three white police officers and two white assistant district attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.597" offset="609782">Stovall, a Negro, was brought in handcuffs, handcuffed to other white officers into the room.</text>

            <text syncTime="196.116" offset="887829">Approximately a year later, when the case came to trial, the district attorney in his opening stated that Mrs. Behrendt would testify that two days after the crime she identified Stovall.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.068" offset="979675">And the prosecutor then said he did not know whether Mrs. Behrendt would be able to identify the petitioner in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.702" offset="1026173">Mrs. Behrendt then later did in fact identify Stovall in court and she did in fact testify that she had previously identified the petitioner in her hospital room.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.917" offset="1103078">Now under New York law, this evidence of prior identification if she had only been able to say, "He is the man I identified a year ago", and if there were no other evidence in the case except for corpus delicti, that would be sufficient evidence of the defendant's guilt to sustain a motion to dismiss the indictment and to sustain a motion -- to sustain the prima facie case of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.706" offset="1254170">In other words this prior identification alone is affirmative evidence both of guilt and to corroborate the in court identification which Mrs. Behrendt made at the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="352.662" offset="1514036">Well actually, in New York it is rather peculiar because until 1927, the New York Courts excluded all evidence of prior identification by the Statute 393 (b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure evidence of prior identification by the witness who was testifying may be admitted if identity is an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.818" offset="1626676">So without the statute, New York would adhere to the common law rule that evidence of prior identification is inadmissible.</text>

            <text syncTime="441.700" offset="1870137">Had Mrs. Behrendt been told that the suspect was going to be brought in?</text>
            <text syncTime="447.161" offset="1891976">And in other words, the defense counsel, as we argue was laying the foundation for the impeachment of Mrs. Behrendt's promised testimony because she did in fact later testified that Stovall had been brought into her room or rather she had been moved to another room and then Stovall was brought in and she there said,"He is the man".</text>

            <text syncTime="1498.183" offset="6096123">May I first correct counsel by stating that the first evidentiary matter in reference to the prior identification was brought out by defense counsel on cross-examination of the state's witness.</text>

            <text syncTime="1554.539" offset="6321507">And may I point out to the -- this honorable body that each and every time a witness points to the defendant at defense table, and I'm certain that each and every witness knows where the defendant sits, he sits alone with his counsel each and every time she or he lifts a finger and points to the defendant at the defense counsel and says, "That is the man", that type of testimony is exactly what took place in the hospital, in Garden City, New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="1619.112" offset="6579806">May I say that the one classification of evidence which is unrestricted or remains the least restricted by statutes and court decision is eyewitness testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.866" offset="6662875">It is important testimony restricted indeed by the weight a jury wishes to place upon it and the credibility a jury wishes to give to the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.640" offset="6725883">In this particular case, the one eyewitness was the widow of the slain doctor who herself was a victim of 11 slashes of the defendant's knife, two of which were near fatal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.183" offset="6812087">She was physically and mentally incapable of making any identification which obviously would be of great import to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.418" offset="6865063">Approximately 36 hours later after arraignment, the defendant was brought to the hospital room where Mrs. Behrendt, the wife of the deceased was able to make identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.454" offset="6929220">Again, she was the only witness who could completely exonerate this defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.967" offset="6967254">And because of this identification we are here this afternoon and may I say this that I much prefer standing before this august body explaining why we made the identification rather than having had Mrs. Behrendt die and she was hovering between life and death, having had her die and explain to this Court why we didn't have an identification made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.621" offset="7089821">It is clean in the briefs of counsel that the identification itself constituted the violation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.722" offset="7130258">I think People against Schmerber -- Schmerber against California excuse me, reiterates the concept of law that testimonial compulsion relates to oral and written testimony of the accused and that identification is not so classified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.078" offset="7235688">No one can deny that identification is an important weapon of the defense, at some times is vital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.277" offset="7280515">And therefore, if there were no Fifth -- if there is no Fifth Amendment problem to be considered, where then does the Sixth Amendment come into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.804" offset="7330565">What could counsel do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.917" offset="7339029">All of the suggestions related by counsel in this case and the previous cases referred to suggestions of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.657" offset="7378004">I might have told the prosecutor to have five men in the lineup rather than three, 10 men rather than five.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.418" offset="7417083">I might not have had the defendant walk this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.390" offset="7428890">I might have had him walk that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.405" offset="7441011">May I suggest that these are suggestions as to police procedures but give no rise to the rights of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.021" offset="7475493">No right to the counsel to suggest this and certainly gives no right under the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.789" offset="7510497">There would be no legal assistance as in the Hamilton and in the White case to which counsel previously referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.652" offset="7562010">Their legal assistance for the defendant was mighty important, but in this particular case, what was being done -- investigation which certainly can survive an arraignment which certainly survives an indictment, which certainly survives even the trial itself because no -- at no time, the people precluded from making further investigation and very often it happens during the course of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.141" offset="7699937">Therefore there was no legal assistance which a counsel could afford defendant in no way, and therefore it does not give rise to the Sixth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2726.266" offset="11008397">I have heard my very good friend Mr. Polsky and also Mr. Fulcon(PH) say that they would have liked to have been present as counsel at the time of these identifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.858" offset="11054791">And indeed they have suggested what they might have thought have to do, how they might have benefited their clients had they been present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.772" offset="11090422">I would like to suggest to the Court that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is not obedient to the desires of counsel to be present or from the contingent benefit that a defendant might have received had counsel been present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.225" offset="11152280">There are many incidents in the preparation of a case by the prosecution either before or after indictment at which had the counsel for the defendant been present, he might have benefited his client's interest, where a prosecutor for example interrogate a witness in the absence of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.624" offset="11245902">Clearly counsel if he were present might cross-examine that witness or interrogate him as well and perhaps have that witness change his testimony to benefit the interest of the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2802.931" offset="11315075">During these preparatory phases of the prosecution's obligation, no one has suggested and I don't think the counsel here today would suggest that the defense counsel has the right to be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.621" offset="11365857">Does it change because the defendant's body is there because the conversation between the prosecutor takes place -- of the prosecutor and the witness takes place in the physical presence of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.919" offset="11419042">We submit that it does not and there is a very vital difference between inspection of the body, movement of the muscles, use of the vocal chords by a defendant and the interrogation of that defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.332" offset="11472750">And I think that is the principle import of the Schmerber decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.876" offset="11490826">It wasn't -- divide a Court, but I think that the majority opinion was quite explicit on this particular phase of the use of the defendant against himself or the use of some facet of his physical characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.903" offset="11546937">The language is that it was the Schmerber case itself, that voice timbre or the use of words for identification purposes is not a testimonial communication such as that covered by the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.681" offset="11598137">I think what we have here is a sixth Amendment question purely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.036" offset="11611512">And the Sixth Amendment question depends upon the limits which are given to the right of an accused to have his counsel -- the assistance of his counsel before his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.771" offset="11654457">I submit to the Court and it is our position that there are limits to that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.637" offset="11673893">He comes into existence when a man becomes an accused and clearly Stovall wasn't accused at the time of the confrontation in the hospital room.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.341" offset="11704717">He did have the right to whatever protection the Sixth Amendment offered him as of that moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.479" offset="11729272">But it is nonetheless incumbent upon the Court I believe to define the extent of that protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.614" offset="11753827">And if we start from the premise that there are limits, there are things that may occur where the defendant does not have the right to the assistance of his counsel, even though it may be to his detriment not to have counsel, even though the counsel may have suggestions to that, then I think it becomes very close to the situation that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.374" offset="11832822">The court below has held that there was no legal service for counsel to perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.579" offset="11857690">Counsel could have made suggestions, counsel could have told his defendant not to say anything, not to allow his voice to be used for identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.631" offset="11893948">But a very important teaching of Schmerber, I submit is that counsel cannot create a right by asserting and a counsel does not have the right if the client does not have the right to remain silent and to withhold his voice as he might cover his face with his hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.290" offset="11968554">Then the mere fact that counsel might advise him to do so does not create that right.</text>

            <text syncTime="3532.398" offset="14232952">Under Section 500 (c) of the New York Code of Criminal Procedure, a sheriff shall not without lawful authority let any such person committed person out of jail which I think precludes any release of a prisoner without a court order.</text>

            <text syncTime="3587.802" offset="14454575">Here, the situation would be analogous to the interview with witnesses if a district attorney when interviewing a witness would then prepare a statement for the witness which the witness then would sign, and then that statement itself would be put in evidence at trial as affirmative proof of what the witness had to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.068" offset="14571604">In other words, the pretrial interview via prosecutor, what transpires at that interview is not evidence --</text>
