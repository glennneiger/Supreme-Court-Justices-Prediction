            <text syncTime="1447.519" offset="5893413">The petitioner began the freezing of pies in August of 1957 after having been in the business for some 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.658" offset="5926013">In the instilling four years up to the time of the filing of the complaint, it sold in Utah, Idaho, Nevada, Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, California, Oregon, Washington, that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.671" offset="5982020">And that was described as a relevant market area by the economist for the respondents, Mr. Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.111" offset="6011800">In September of 1958, the petitioner built a new plant, and it was a good plant and it was an efficient plant and the evidence on that is rather dramatic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.069" offset="6055685">One of the respondents, the Pet Company had the manager of its frozen food departments sneak into the plant by fraudulent means.</text>

            <text syncTime="1512.676" offset="6154115">But there isn't any question here about the ability in terms of efficient manager of the petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1934.723" offset="7842252">And that cost justification included among other things the advertising justification which this Court rejected in the recent Borden case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.423" offset="7873076">This notion that there's a -- that there's a real cost differential just because you put the canned milk in Borden -- Borden can in one instance and in a private label, the Safeway private label in another instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.117" offset="7931800">So there was a very great conflict in the evidence on cost justification and yet the Court of Appeals to handle this statement case and the Court of Appeals was I think frank in saying that you could misconstrue the evidence unless you put an improper perspective, proper focus for the language used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.318" offset="7984671">I submit that that basically is a jury question, putting the evidence in a perspective.</text>

            <text syncTime="1978.462" offset="8017272">But then secondly, and this one will hurt a little bit, the Court said it doesn't make any difference anyway because Safeway was unwilling to buy from Utah Pie because of the unwillingness of Utah Pie to put in certain quality controls.</text>

            <text syncTime="2123.865" offset="8598862">And he said he went out and bought the apples on the basis of that representation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2165.435" offset="8765106">This is kind of a peculiar buyer really, says, this man Young will act as a door opener for us, for our sales personnel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2202.758" offset="8914422">We asked the Safeway man, "Did you make these agreements to send your own inter-office memorandum to these people to help them make the sales?"</text>

            <text syncTime="2319.518" offset="9381491">Now, in addition before leaving Pet, in addition to the men and the obvious men of the station with the predatory intent, we think they use the Swiss Miss as kind of a fighting brand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.013" offset="9427466">But we were accused both in the Court of Appeals and before the jury as simply using anti-trust clichés as they were called.</text>

            <text syncTime="2348.282" offset="9496534">Now, so far as Swiss Miss is concerned, and the Court inquired about that on a national basis they sold their quality pie greatly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.432" offset="9533106">They volume of the quality pie was greatly over the quality of this Swiss Miss which was a price pie of pure ounce of (Voice Overlap) in effect, so then.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.072" offset="9571662">In this market, in this trading area, now I'm talking about the heart of the trading area, in this market, Swiss Miss sold 13 to 1 as against the quality pie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.150" offset="9615966">We said they were simply using it as a fighting brand in that particular area.</text>

            <text syncTime="2968.890" offset="11978898">In Continental, there was an evidence that Continental was a price leader.</text>

            <text syncTime="2989.267" offset="12060400">Continental had its plant in Virginia, they had a plant in Iowa, it have a custom packing arrangement in California.</text>

            <text syncTime="3002.695" offset="12114108">Now, with respect to predatory intent and this again, the Court of Appeals treats us though there wasn't any conflict in the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.120" offset="12147858">The broker of Continental told the petitioner that I am going to run you out of business, broker of Continental, only that I do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.609" offset="12193834">And then shortly after telling that for a period from June 16 to August 12 of 1961 Continental instituted the lowest price in the entire United States on frozen pies in a transaction with the Safeway Company which is extended to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.417" offset="12257050">Now, the Court of Appeals accepts the statement made by a respondent that this was just a two-week deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.440" offset="12277112">That this needs a little analysis, first of all it wasn't two weeks, that that price of $2.55 admittedly below cost or at least substantial evidence that it was below cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.761" offset="12326431">That price lasted from June 16 to August 12, and was the thing that precipitated this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.083" offset="12359659">When you sell a six-week supply and the evidence was that even though there were two sales, it was a six-week supply, when you sell a six-week supply simply like the Safeway Company, you don't have a six-week effect on the price structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.825" offset="12422666">It may take a year to get over the injury that a six-week price with the Safeway Company can bring about.</text>

            <text syncTime="3300.299" offset="13304560">For this reason, in the circumstances of this case, it's quite obvious that injury to this plaintiff is injury to competition because this plaintiff is the only substantial independent competitor in the area.</text>

            <text syncTime="3350.498" offset="13505390">The areas we're talking about, the -- the injury -- the injury to this particular competitor resulted in an erosion of its price structure, that's one.</text>

            <text syncTime="3369.760" offset="13582399">Now, on -- with specifically with respect to the Denver area which the Court of Appeals read out of the case entirely or just let me say a word on that because I think it fits in with the question asked by Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.101" offset="13631822">The pretrial order in this case was very explicit on the back that we were talking about Colorado.</text>

            <text syncTime="3391.572" offset="13669648">There was price discrimination in the record as you will see in Appendix C in the brief between Denver, Colorado and areas and other areas for the Morton Company, very clear price discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.593" offset="13729729">We introduced that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.278" offset="13740492">It was argued to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.447" offset="13753135">We had information on damages; on our damage exhibit, we had damages for the Denver area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.151" offset="13779989">We have a witness who examined on the Denver area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.290" offset="13796498">The counsel for Continental cross-examined that damage witness on the Denver area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.999" offset="13819382">I argue that to the jury, they argued it to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.690" offset="13834115">The form of the verdict simply said, Utah trading area and throughout, we have talked about that meaning as the area in which the plaintiff distributes or sells its pies despite that the Court of Appeals says that Denver wasn't in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.372" offset="13896808">As I say, I don't know how you can possibly come to that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.402" offset="13908929">When Judge Wheeler framed his decree, this is how much he thought that was in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.535" offset="13941530">He says that the violation occurred in the plaintiff's trading area (Utah, Idaho, Washington, Montana, and Colorado, as against California), where the defendant's production facilities are located.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.089" offset="13995760">And then he decree that there should be no lower prices in Utah, Idaho, Washington, Montana, and Colorado than in California or in the case of Continental for the State of Colorado the prices charged in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.424" offset="14061066">Now, how in the line of that record, the Court of Appeals can say that Denver wasn't in this case when it states it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.650" offset="14077994">It specifically says that because now the damage exhibit 1 to that jury and judge told the -- told the jury consider that damage exhibit with Denver on it and was cross-examined because the form of verdict said Utah trading area, the judge says that means the State of Utah in effect or the immediate area upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.275" offset="14152495">And I submit in any event that -- that that the trial court understood it differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.888" offset="14170885">Obviously, counsel for the respondents understood it differently, he crossed-examined on that damage exhibit relating to Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.953" offset="14195231">The Denver invoices are in the record, they are in evidence and on that basis, I submit to the Court of Appeals that this point simply couldn't put that Denver picture in into perspective or focus as we call it and eliminated the whole sale from the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.748" offset="14254373">Now the -- finally, we think the evidence showed injurious impact, I think, were required in the private damage action to show the elements of violation of injurious impact and not that economic evidence in this record to justify the damage awards, and I think the damage awards are rather conservative in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.182" offset="14336084">There was a price erosion from a $4 level to a $3 level in the period of time that was before the jury and whether this price erosion was the effect of the competitive practices of the respondents was for the jury to say and the jury found it our way, in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.130" offset="14403897">There were reduced volumes.</text>

O. V.</text>
            <text syncTime="6221.017" offset="24987460">We also argued that the petitioner had never proved any impact, even assuming a violation of law then convenient to his business or property.</text>
            <text syncTime="6227.460" offset="25013164">And of course he hasn't, as a review of this record will show you.</text>
            <text syncTime="6230.454" offset="25025181">But that was the second basic ground for our -- for our directive verdict motions and our N. O. V. motions.</text>

            <text syncTime="6241.785" offset="25070529">In terms of the Denver case which he also argues alternatively all you can do there is read the -- read the charge that went to the jury speaking only of Utah, only of Salt Lake City and quite clearly that charge do not tell that jury to make any determination as the Denver facts and that the chart is in the -- is in the record and they will -- they will explain it to you the propriety of that holding of law made by the appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6267.114" offset="25171780">Now on the procedural questions, I -- I have only about five minutes, both sides have agree in their brief that the Court of Appeals met to foreclose a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6276.755" offset="25210441">And we submit to you that the authority, it's clearly there, it's not in Rule 50 (d) or any place else.</text>
            <text syncTime="6282.514" offset="25233429">It's in the statute 2106, it's been in the statute since 1789 and you can trace it through as I have in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6289.832" offset="25262686">Now, 50 (d) doesn't add towards the track down of that statute, the -- the Section 20 -- Section 2072 of the U.S. Code would not per -- permit a rule of procedure that it finds on appellate courts that is Enabling Act itself is limited to promulgation of rules for District Courts, practices and procedures in District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6314.581" offset="25361742">One reason I think that 50 (d) doesn't say and this appellate court may deny instead to do so is beyond the scope of -- of Enabling Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6324.405" offset="25401031">Now, the reason that says that it may grant, I think, is purely permissive language.</text>
            <text syncTime="6329.197" offset="25420152">There was some confusion in the cases as to -- as to what the impact of Redmond was and whether or not the appellate courts could in addition the granting N. O. V. and directing judgment below, if they also could grant new trial and some of the cases we've cited expressed some concern, now that maybe, I don't know I can't tell the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6349.171" offset="25500087">Definitely, but that maybe the reason why 50 (d) is written the way it is, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="6354.603" offset="25521821">But the fact of the matter is that all of these other cases, Redmond, Slocum, Hennegan, all endorsed the proposition that Section 2106 gives the appellate courts the authority, gives them authority to enter any, physically, any order that is just to require here any order that is just.</text>
            <text syncTime="6372.897" offset="25594964">Now, when the Cone decided the -- the holding in Cone and in effect limited 2106 and in that way tended to -- well, Cone said in certain circumstances the appellate courts may not order judgment be entered below.</text>
            <text syncTime="6390.115" offset="25663822">But the reason you had to say that was to protect the force and efficacy of -- of the debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6395.398" offset="25684929">What you had to do was to prevent an appellant having a choice between which Court is he going to ask for new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6403.527" offset="25717530">Now, if you let him get away with what he try to do in Cone and in fact what he does is withhold this motion for judgment N. O. V. in the trial court then present it to the appellate court on a theory that maybe -- on a theory that maybe this Court is must apt to foreclose a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6418.721" offset="25778239">Now, in order to avoid that kind of forum shopping here you've got to hold that this Court, any appellate court has the authority to make the new trial decision, it's perfectly clear that it does in my judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6431.623" offset="25829857">It can review and reverse grants of new trials Fairmont -- your own Fairmont case makes that clear and if you're going to say to this petitioner in effect why you didn't ask for a new trial in the appellate court but that doesn't preclude you from going back to the trial court to ask for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6447.843" offset="25894745">You just obviously give and clearly he can ask the appellate court first because that's right in Rule 50 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="6453.346" offset="25916792">And to say to him, "Well, you can have your choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="6455.819" offset="25926614">If you think the trial court's more apt to give you a new trial withhold your motion from the Appellate Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6460.240" offset="25944377">And then go to the trial court for it -- with it," but that can't be a reasonable rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6466.089" offset="25967679">There's no -- there's no reason for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6467.724" offset="25974262">Moreover, the common rationale is that we're going to make you follow this strictest rule of 50 (d) because if you do it, if you make your motion for a new trial and N. O. V. in the trial court, you're going to get that judge to correct the errors he may have made and you're going to get a chance on a new trial for a fresh appraisal of the witnesses in the evidence, to determine whether there should be a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6491.745" offset="26070392">But you don't have that in the case like this where the trial judge is insistent upon entering judgment on the verdict and denying a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6500.118" offset="26103829">You're not -- he doesn't have any opportunity to correct his errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6502.814" offset="26114591">He's -- he's going to insist on these errors if there were.</text>
            <text syncTime="6505.781" offset="26126503">And he's got, when this case goes back after a lengthy appeal, two years, three years, he's got no fresh appraisal of -- of the witnesses or the evidence to bring to bear on this matter or should have been a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6517.082" offset="26171747">He may not even be sitting for all we know.</text>
            <text syncTime="6519.059" offset="26179584">But in any event the case is stayed by then.</text>
            <text syncTime="6522.023" offset="26191496">And there's no reason that I can think of why we should be more interested in his -- his single individual exercise of discretion in this context than the exercise of discretion if you will by three judges on an the appellate court county.</text>
            <text syncTime="6535.494" offset="26245308">Let the appellee follow the dictates the Rule 50 (d), make the motion that's required under that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="6541.256" offset="26268400">Let the appellate court while the case is overly there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6544.275" offset="26280521">Let it decide, is there any ground for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6547.879" offset="26294836">If -- if the ground were -- I've got some new evidence, make them determine that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6551.760" offset="26310405">This petitioner doesn't say it has any new evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6554.134" offset="26319914">He just wants to go back and have ano -- not to go with Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="6557.401" offset="26332975">Well, if he made that motion in the appellate court, the appellate court could have -- could have decided that matter just as well his judgment occurred and there's nothing -- we think there should be a flexible rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="6568.120" offset="26375816">We don't say that in every instance the appellate court need make it and foreclose trial court discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6573.475" offset="26397236">There would be some instances where it should be sent back as the Rule 50 (d) makes it perfectly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="6577.746" offset="26414373">But there ought to be a flexible rule, for instance in the area of -- of judicial, of -- of equity judges writing decrees, shaping their own decrees, there's nothing more sink or swim, that's the discretionary with them and yet there are instances such as the El Paso case where the Court, in that case this Court, say, we're not going to leave divestiture, we're not going to leave relief to the discretion of the trial court in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6602.330" offset="26512697">We're going to order in this instance, we're going to order that divestiture be accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="6607.542" offset="26533491">And that's perfectly proper.</text>

            <text syncTime="7220.671" offset="28986075">The reason for that was that Carnation found that it couldn't maintain list prices, there's own prices in any market that within a week or so after they've published their out of dates.</text>
            <text syncTime="7231.795" offset="29030588">So it finally it just left its list prices as they were and in each market, the relatively short period would come up with a particular deal or special offering for that particular period to meet whatever the situation was in that particular market.</text>

            <text syncTime="7911.624" offset="31749831">They contend that because Pet occasionally had a different price between California and Salt Lake City, Utah even though they never met the Utah price or never beat the Utah price, that fact is a violation of Section 2 (a) of the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7935.522" offset="31845439">The Utah Pie Company says secondly, that if the Pet Milk Company has desires of selling frozen fruit pies in Salt Lake City at a lower price than it sells in Los Angeles or San Francisco that it must build a plant in Salt Lake City.</text>
            <text syncTime="7956.606" offset="31929762">Now these two issues were before the jury and they were contested by virtue of the instructions to the jury, they were before the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="7971.005" offset="31987440">But in view of the fact that the Tenth Circuit decided that there was an insufficiency of evidence, these two points were passed over.</text>
            <text syncTime="7979.462" offset="32021191">Consequently, if the Court should decide that there was a sufficiency of evidence, this case should go back to the Tenth Circuit or this Court itself should answer those two questions in order that if we have to go back to the United States District Court to try the case again, we will know precisely what the law is on those two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="8001.406" offset="32108962">Now briefly, that the Pet Milk Company, in about 1954 when their sales of evaporated milk were going downhill in due -- due to the change of economics in this country, they started too diversify their products and they were looking around for products would get what they called convenience foods.</text>
            <text syncTime="8025.600" offset="32205824">And they started applying the frozen fruit pie which was a brand new product.</text>
            <text syncTime="8030.211" offset="32224214">This was being manufactured in Beulah, Michigan by a man, by the name of Pet Ritz, that's where the name Pet-Ritz comes from.</text>
            <text syncTime="8038.797" offset="32258591">He was making frozen cherry pies in Beulah, Michigan, the president of the Pet Milk Company had a summer home up there and he bought one of these pies and found what a delicious pie it was, what a great idea it was to have frozen fruit pies.</text>
            <text syncTime="8053.194" offset="32316165">He acquired the Beulah plant, moved it the Frankfort, Michigan, used the test market in Chicago, Detroit, Toledo, and Milwaukee and found that there was tremendous acceptance for this high quality eight-inch, 24-ounce pie.Pet being a company that dealt in national distribution, it immediately established a plant with the Chambersburg, Pennsylvania and in Fresno, California in order to serve the entire market throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="8082.243" offset="32432358">Now, Pet had been in the Salt Lake City market for many, many years, selling ice creams, selling evaporated milk, selling dairy products, they weren't new in the Salt Lake market.</text>
            <text syncTime="8095.136" offset="32483871">They entered the Salt Lake market 1955 with this frozen fruit pie, two years before the Utah Pie Company ever went in the frozen pie business.</text>
            <text syncTime="8104.141" offset="32519920">Now, it is true that the Utah Pie Company was in the fresh pie business from 1927 up to the latter time.</text>
            <text syncTime="8112.701" offset="32554193">Now, the Utah Pie Company entered the frozen pie business in late 1957 which is two years after Pet had.</text>
            <text syncTime="8121.457" offset="32589197">Now, when Pet went into this frozen pie business it did precisely what most progressive companies do when they enter a market with the new product.</text>
            <text syncTime="8130.456" offset="32625246">They engaged in some very costly advertising and promotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="8135.792" offset="32646562">In the first year, 1957, they spent over $900,000 on television and radio programs and in-store promotions.</text>
            <text syncTime="8146.245" offset="32688358">The following year, they spent some over $800,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="8150.547" offset="32705599">They went along for about three years and the first thing you know they noticed that that small fresh fruit pie companies throughout the entire United States could enter this business with practically no difficulty whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="8164.798" offset="32762546">As a consequence, it was extremely hard for them to bring themselves into a profit position because they were spending so much on a promotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="8172.879" offset="32794937">Now, they didn't do anything differently than Ford Motor Car Company did when they spend $160 million to tool-up on the Mustang and a million dollars in the advertising in the first 13 weeks when they put that car up.</text>
            <text syncTime="8185.646" offset="32845928">If you wanted to buy a Mustang at cost, it would probably cost you about a $150,000 if you bought the first car up the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="8192.544" offset="32873514">I can remember about a number of years ago, I asked an executive friend of mine in Westinghouse, if he'd get me a colored television at the said cost, he said "Well, I'll have a little difficulty getting it -- getting you one at this price.</text>
            <text syncTime="8206.278" offset="32928475">But I'm sure the company will be delighted to sell you what it cost because they're costing us $49,000 a piece as they're coming off of the line at this time."</text>
            <text syncTime="8215.822" offset="32966614">Pet's cost in introducing the frozen fruit pie throughout the United States where prohibiting in these first years and this small independent fresh pie companies that ought to get into the business got in after the consumer acceptance had been build up at a very high cost, then immediately brought one of its top executive in to examine this situation to find out if they could bring in into a proper position.</text>
            <text syncTime="8240.541" offset="33065566">They cut this out a thousand cost from $900,000 to $42,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="8244.706" offset="33082180">They had a market shares study done by the Market Research Corporation of Chicago and that company advised them that they have to get into an economy pie, if the American public, the housewife wanted a quality pie and an economy pie as a consequence Pet got into the Swiss Miss with a 20-ounce pie as distinguished from a 24-ounce pie.</text>
            <text syncTime="8267.073" offset="33171623">In addition, they discover that the competition at the chain store level is so great that they have to get into the private label business that they therefore started negotiations with Safeway to build a manufacture for them frozen pies under the Bel-air label which gives a label that's owned by Safeway stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="8288.209" offset="33256260">Now, after the Utah Pie Company went into the frozen pie business, what happened to it?</text>
            <text syncTime="8294.410" offset="33281024">Their first full year in the business, they sold 69,000 dozen frozen fruit pies in the Salt -- Salt Lake City market.</text>
            <text syncTime="8304.282" offset="33320521">They increase their sales in the Salt Lake City market until 1961 that the Utah Pie Company sold 248,000 cases of frozen fruit pies.</text>
            <text syncTime="8318.936" offset="33379140">They had a loss in 1957 of $5400.</text>
            <text syncTime="8325.050" offset="33403591">In 1961, they increased the profits of the Utah Pie Company to $30,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="8332.665" offset="33433997">They have nine member of the Rigby family working at the small plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="8338.683" offset="33458134">They increased their salaries from 1961 from $57,000 to $82,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="8345.802" offset="33486555">They have a great successful frozen fruit pie business in the Salt Lake markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="8353.186" offset="33516126">They made one mistake as Judge Phillips said in his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="8358.555" offset="33537546">They were the arch price cutter in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="8362.143" offset="33551966">Rather than going in with promotion methods taking advantage of their Utah brand name which was known in that market, doing in-store promotions rather than merchandising their product, they decided that the way to get their business was to do it by cut prices and by severe cut prices.</text>

            <text syncTime="8451.388" offset="33908903">Now, in the lower court, Your Honors, I introduced -- I have a study made by Drs. Lambourne and Anderson who are the economist at Utah State University, and my appellant here Mr. Alioto, seized my market share study and introduced it for me, got in the evidence before I had a chance to introduce it myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="8474.818" offset="34002631">My chart here 838 was introduced by Mr. Alioto and also the market share study was introduced by him and it's him who gets in the record and shows you the relative position of these three respondents and of the Utah Pie Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="8492.300" offset="34072534">Now, each case has six parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="8496.362" offset="34088835">Now, this -- this chart shows the purple line here is the Pet-Ritz pie which is the 24-ounce, eight-inch pie manufactured by the Pet Milk Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="8510.514" offset="34145468">The red line is the Simple Simon pie manufactured by Carnation.</text>
            <text syncTime="8515.598" offset="34165739">The orange line here is the Utah Pie line.</text>
            <text syncTime="8521.411" offset="34189040">The dotted purple line is the Bel-air pie and the Swiss Miss, purple is the 20-ounce Pet pie and across to the plain, orange is the Utah private labeled pie and the green is the Continental pie.</text>
            <text syncTime="8543.266" offset="34276394">Now, this Bel-air is a misleading situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="8547.604" offset="34293739">The Safeway Company purchases its frozen fruit pies from an F. O. B. mail basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="8553.667" offset="34318085">Therefore, if you are to get a true picture of a Bel-air price, you have to have add the freight from Fresno, California to Salt Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="8563.016" offset="34355388">All of the rest of these pies are sold on a delivery price basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="8567.687" offset="34374092">Ironically, I have had an overlay made to show what happens when you add up -- add the freight to the Bel-air price.</text>
            <text syncTime="8579.870" offset="34422888">Well, I use 16 cents which is a mean between 32 and 35 which is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="8587.011" offset="34451414">Mr. Alioto's expert witness, an accountant said that the price per dozen from Fresno to Salt Lake City was 48 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="8595.536" offset="34485478">I use the smaller figure of 16 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="8599.185" offset="34500106">Now, when you add the 16 cents to the price of Bel-air pies, you will see that the price of the Bel-air Safeway pie is above the Utah brand pie, it's also above the Frost 'N Flame pie.</text>
            <text syncTime="8614.301" offset="34560606">Now, Your Honors when this study was made by Professors Lambourne and Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="8620.504" offset="34585370">They collected actual invoices of the sales made to the leading wholesalers in the Salt Lake City market.</text>
            <text syncTime="8627.904" offset="34614941">These are actual prices taken from invoices of each one of the -- of Pet, Carnation, Continental and Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="8639.755" offset="34662379">As a consequence, you have a picture here which shows in relation to the Pet case that Pet never at any time lowered its price even equal to Utah much less bidding.</text>
            <text syncTime="8655.658" offset="34726013">Now, one addition in order to factor out the 20-ounce pie to a 24-ounce pie, I have had an overlay here which shows when the Swiss Miss is made into a 24-ounce pie, the line goes above the Utah brand label and all go above the Frost 'N Flame label.</text>
            <text syncTime="8676.592" offset="34809710">As a consequence, Pet never meant and never beat the Utah prices in the Salt Lake City market.</text>
            <text syncTime="8685.237" offset="34844296">Now, this is very important as far as Robinson-Patman Act case is concerned, we're going to talk about a primary line case, the main primary line cases which we have are the Mead versus Moore, Atlas Building Block, Maryland Baking, what happened if those predatory price discrimination did wrap up the cases, was a severe price dive that went below and stayed below and drove the object of that price cut out of business or diverted substantial business from that individual, that was not the case in the case of Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="8729.201" offset="35020152">The case was exactly the opposite.</text>

            <text syncTime="9101.464" offset="36509236">Now, Your Honors, in summary, in so far as the procedural question is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="9107.155" offset="36532015">I'd like to say this that Mr. Alioto lost on the conspiracy count below.</text>
            <text syncTime="9113.188" offset="36556152">He was asking for $750,000 from Pet treble and he got $44,000 treble.</text>
            <text syncTime="9120.236" offset="36584364">Mr. Alioto is one of the most skillful line cost lawyers in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="9124.029" offset="36599515">Now, his -- his Utah Pie Company was very ably represented in the trial of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="9129.896" offset="36622921">As a matter of fact the judge sustained him a 187 times and sustained the defendants in this case 15 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="9138.252" offset="36656358">That the -- Mr. -- Mr. Alioto if -- if he had any idea that there was a possibility that he needed a new trial on this conspiracy count, he would have made a motion to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="9150.001" offset="36703378">He did not do that because of the disparity in the -- in the verdict, the $750,000 versus $44,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="9156.496" offset="36729396">I'm sure if he had thought he had grounds a new trial, he would have made it and then he had another chance to make the motion for a new trial in the Court of Appeals and he didn't make any motion for a new trial there.</text>
            <text syncTime="9168.113" offset="36775790">We feel very strongly that the Court of Appeals under 2106 has the power as this Court does and we do not think that if litigation is going to be ultimately ended that Rule 50 (d) has to be construed by this Court or it has to be amended, changed and clarified in order to make sure that litigation stops some place and we think under the circumstances in that respect that as far as the procedural question is concerned that the Court of Appeals have the right to do what they did and we think the judgment should be entered for -- for the Pet Milk Company as -- as directed by the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="9202.818" offset="36914657">Now, we think as far as this Court is concerned that the Court can conclude that certiorari in the Pet case was improperly granted and can reverse itself on certiorari and allow the decision of the Tenth Circuit Court to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="9218.783" offset="36978500">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
