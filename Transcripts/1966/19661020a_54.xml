            <label>Mr. Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="25.777" offset="206451">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.968" offset="223274">This is one of two cases that have been set down one to follow the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.549" offset="245530">This case, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals which had affirmed an order of deportation issued against Giuseppe Errico.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.668" offset="314075">Errico had entered the United States in 1959 by fraudulent representation made in order to bypass the then quota requirements for his native country of Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.386" offset="376874">The decision of the court below is in direct conflict with that of the Second Circuit in Scott against Immigration Service which is the case to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.352" offset="420760">The issue in both cases is much the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.452" offset="437164">It is whether a relief provision of the Immigration Act of 1961, intended we think to be a relatively narrow applicability actually waives the deportation of Errico.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.922" offset="503097">The Government contends that the provision Section 241 helps in the Immigration Act does not authorize the waiver of deportation in each of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.901" offset="554924">A conclusion we say is supported by the text of the statute, the intention of Congress and the overall statutory scheme of the nationality acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.589" offset="613752">As to the facts, Errico is now 32, is a native and citizen of Italy and because at the time he sought entry as of the present time, the Italian quota was substantially oversubscribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.099" offset="683760">Indeed, we point out in the brief that at the time of his entry, the waiting list was some 162,612 and he made this false statement in order to obtain entry into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.924" offset="747081">He falsely represented that he was a skilled mechanic with experience in repairing foreign automobile and because of that representation, he was granted a first preference status under the Italian quota.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.117" offset="815835">And under the then existing preference system and those are Section 203 (a) and (1), he was admitted in the United States in October of 1959 and he has resided continuously in Portland, Oregon since his entry.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.427" offset="905070">The recent provision of course changes the whole quota system that's gone and as of now he could qualify to come in but there's still would be I think it's 20,000 for Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.807" offset="962644">But as it now stands we're applying the law as it was at the time he came in and at the time he --</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="221.906" offset="990960">Well, I was just wondering how big a problem is this in number any idea?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="226.754" offset="1010395">Well, the number, it's pretty hard, the best example, I don't know how we do it these figures there, there are some 3 million resident aliens in the country as of now.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.796" offset="1070582">As to how many of them run to this, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.530" offset="1081448">And -- but on the other point if you're interested on what would happen to him if this case stands and the deportation stands as to the area code, he has parents here and it's not clear in the record as to whether they are citizens yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.268" offset="1176430">And he has brothers and sisters eight at least, at least eight brothers and sisters not more, and as he stands he would not be entitled to preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.036" offset="1219480">But while he's in the United States, he could ask for discretionary relief and he could apply for adjustment of status.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.470" offset="1257200">But that would be under the Attorney General so it's not a certainty that he wouldn't have to go back at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="305.619" offset="1325850">The way I am advised by the Revenue Service that under 245 which is 8 U.S. Code 1255 he could qualify for adjustment of status and the immigration quota for Italy is still pretty far back as to this amount and he would have to qualify for some of the preferences and that would depend as to whether or not his mother and father are citizens or the brothers and sisters wouldn't help him too much but we don't know those facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="352.099" offset="1511737">And once the deportation is ordered upon him then he appealed straight up.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.719" offset="1542248">I in the hearings, I don't see why this was ever raised at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.946" offset="1559176">You might have been but it doesn't appear in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.733" offset="1574327">And they just merely relied -- Errico relied on this statute which is this later statute which gives him this absolute right to stay in the country if he's got a spouse or a child who is a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.037" offset="1639528">And they relied on that because you see that does not require the attorney general's waivers or the attorney general's discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.122" offset="1683832">Obviously, they didn't want to submit to the attorney general's discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.876" offset="1694908">That's the only way I can see.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.777" offset="1706506">I am told that even as of now, that there is a provision where even if this opinion is reversed of the Court of Appeals, there still is a waiver possibility but I can't commit to attorney general as to what he will do and that depends on the status of his family as of now which we don't know.</text>

            <text syncTime="1132.860" offset="4634833">But I think the language is what we are worried about the Ninth Circuit language is so broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.087" offset="4667747">On the -- getting back to the point, you bear in mind that this Section 241 (f) which is on page 4 as I remember and I have to once more say that it's on the ground that the alien was excludable at the time of his entry and it appear, it would appear that it was for procured documents of forgery and what have you and then it says otherwise admissible and that's our whole case and Judge Duniway as I mentioned felt that it was otherwise admissible was a term of our attorney referring only to qualitative grounds and not to quantitative and that's his whole basis and I view his opinion as an effort to so limit the two judges opinion so that it would stand up but we say that falls too and Judge Duniway we point out, beginning on page 26 that the only basis for his assertion is Section 211 (a) which we have set out in our appendix and he assumes that since 211 (a) used a specific language about quota that the fact that it didn't use it in our statute makes it clear that it didn't intend it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.633" offset="5025938">But our reading of 241 (f) waives only deportability for misrepresentation and not any additional grounds because if there are additional grounds you can go through the other sections of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.523" offset="5089468">And when we look at 241 in (f) in the overall statutory scheme which I like to do for a change, you remember that way back prior to 48, they had put in provisions, there was no provision as a matter of fact and if there was a misrepresentation, the only means of deportability was the courts would determine that you didn't have a visa and you only because you lied to get a visa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.296" offset="5216528">And then the Displaced Persons Act of 1948 said that anybody who lies shall forever be barred from admission and then in 1952 and 1957 and eventually the one that we get up here 1251 it would show that throughout this, Congress has never meant to throw out the quota system and we spelled that out in our brief and we stand on that particular point as stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.718" offset="5346200">Every other way provision in the Immigration Act is hinged with applying to the attorney general of the United States and proving that you are entitled to get the attorney general to exercise a discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.837" offset="5418715">And I don't believe we can assume the Congress in this one intended to give absolute authority on misrepresentations that normally would have had to go through the other section of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1586.393" offset="6448985">The respondent in this case feels that the issue is concisely stated on page 17 of the petitioner's brief and I quote from that, in short, to be otherwise admissible at the time of entry, the applicant for relief under Section 241 (f) must show that he could have been admitted even if he had not lied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.092" offset="6551698">An alien like respondent Errico could not meet the quota requirements because he cannot make that showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.740" offset="6586284">In other words it is the petitioner's position that Errico in this case because the truth of the fact is that he is not a specialized mechanic cannot enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.413" offset="6660995">Now it is respondent's position that to interpret 241 (f) in this manner is to render it meaningless, to frustrate the intent of Congress and to inhibit purpose of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.286" offset="6716479">Respondent contends what Judge Jones in his dissenting opinion in the Second Circuit that in the Scott case I believe or Smith, Smith that the words otherwise admissible as used in 241 (f) are qualitatively restrictive but not quantitatively restrictive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.269" offset="6804459">All of Section 7 of the Act which is the predecessor of 241 (f) which is the Section we're now dealing with is set forth in the 1957 U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News at page 709 under the heading nonquota status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.490" offset="6881364">Respondent in supporting his position that otherwise admissible is quantitatively restrictive relies heavily on the presumption that 241 (f) was enacted for the benefit of a special class of Mexican nationals and the fact that they were nonquota immigrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.553" offset="6957537">It is our position that the Mexican nationals were only one of a group of an entire defined class that were contemplated by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.758" offset="7014379">A review of the House Report No. 1199 of the Judiciary Committee upon the 1957 U.S. Code administrative news page 2016 reveals that Section 7 of September 11, 57th Amendment to the immigration, the Nationality Act was enacted for two general class, subsection (b) for displaced persons and other immigrants who entered the United States immediately following World War II and subsection (a) for spouses, parents, children and children of United States citizens or local resident aliens who seek admission to the United States and who may have misrepresented their place of birth, national immigrant status and the like if their exclusion would work in extreme hardship on their family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.378" offset="7192848">The latter category included Mexican nationals who entered the United States during a period when border control operations suffered from laxity who later established the family in this country and were subsequently found to reside illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.886" offset="7254915">Approximately two years prior to the enactment of Section 7 border control forces had been strengthened and the Immigration and Naturalization Service had intensified its efforts in rounding up illegal entrance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.900" offset="7306951">The immigration service argues that because Congress contemplated relief for these Mexicans and because they were not then and are not now subject to quota limitations otherwise admissible is quantitatively restrictive as well as qualitatively restrictively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.472" offset="7369226">Now, Section 7 subsection (b) of the 1957 Act dealing with refugees and displaced persons specifically refers to them as entrance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.551" offset="7421576">Now, this is part of the same act subsection (b) of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.411" offset="7441011">And it states referring to them admitted to the United States between December 26 and November 1, 1954 and misrepresented, goes on to say it's misrepresented their nationality place of birth their identity etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.912" offset="7499003">Now, this portion was made discretionary upon the attorney general and was specifically placed there for displaced persons entering this country during a specific period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.546" offset="7557517">Now unlike Section (b), the first sentence which we referred to now which became 241 (f) and which the immigration service was feels enacted specifically for the Mexican national in no place referred to them specifically or in any way mentioned then nor does it mention any dates concerning the border crossing incidents referred to or anything of the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.611" offset="7661798">Now the House Report 1199 found in 1957 U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News at page 2024 referring to this indicates as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.126" offset="7711848">In respect to expulsion of aliens who are spouses, parents, children of the United States citizen who are lawfully resident aliens who are already in the United States, misrepresentations of any documentation for entry would not be a ground for deportation if the aliens were otherwise admissible at the time of entry under the immigration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.155" offset="7783946">The latter category of aliens includes mostly Mexican nationals who are during the time went border control operation suffered from regrettable likes that they were able to enter the United States, established families in this country and were subsequently found to reside illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.570" offset="7853641">Now, the committee on the judiciary for the House and the Senate have a considerable number of private bills before them which the conduct of such aliens considering their family situation would be condoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.839" offset="7906722">A great number of such private bills passed the Congress and were enacted in the law the last few years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.360" offset="7928769">It appears to the committee as it is unfair to improperly commit the benefit of legislative relief solely to a few selected individuals who are in a position to reach Congress for redraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.312" offset="7972655">It is felt that the humanitarian approach should be extended to an entire defined class of aliens rather than to selected individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.852" offset="8014764">Now, they don't in any way refer to Mexicans and then in the 1961 amendment to this Act the House Judiciary Committee commented that there was no longer any need for subsection (b) which referred to displaced persons and persons that are trying to escape communism and so the 1961 amendment deleted that subsection (b), no longer referred to them at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.247" offset="8132315">Subsection (a) though, the first part of the Act referring to the Mexican nationals remained in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.573" offset="8161677">Now, certainly it's nowhere been argued that in 1961 the need for the Mexicans continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.163" offset="8188008">However, it remained in the law, and as a matter of fact it remains in the 1965 law exactly as it was in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.668" offset="8217997">It has never been repealed and the need for it if it were simply just for Mexicans I think certainly by now would have passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.295" offset="8252583">But as I indicated before the language of it it's absolutely general and therefore we think that if Congress meant exactly what it said when it wanted to expand that to an entire defined class rather than to any specific group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.974" offset="8323218">Now, otherwise admissible and I don't want to take too much time on this argument but in the Scott case has an excellent argument in it concerning the present 241 (f) as compared to the last section of Section 7 as it appears and we wholeheartedly agree with their position and feel that it reflects the intent of Congress again as we have stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.273" offset="8452472">Now, otherwise admissible, is used elsewhere in the Act also, 241 (f) and 241 (h) are set forth in the 1957 U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News at page 709.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.809" offset="8514644">Now under the heading Immigration Nonquota Status indicating to me that clearly that that is not quantitative, it's not considered under a quantitative section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.098" offset="8567724">It's under the nonquota section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.632" offset="8577860">Now, another part of the act Section 12 of the 1957 Amendment sets forth another example of otherwise admissible meaning qualitative better than quantitative and I quote from that directly “any alien eligible for quota immigration status under the provisions of Section 23 -- 203 (a) (1), (2), or (3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 1153 (a) (1), (2), (3) of Title 8 on the basis of petition approved by the attorney general prior to 1957, shall be held a nonquota immigrant and if otherwise admissible under the provisions of the act shall be issued a nonquota immigrant visa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.550" offset="8761553">Now there clearly it stating that if he's otherwise admissible he won't be considered a nonquota immigrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.202" offset="8788198">Now, Judge Duniway in his concurring opinion points out another Section 211 (a) and from that section I would like to quote the following, “No immigrant shall be admitted into United States unless at the time of his application for admission he (1) has a valid unexpired, (2) he's properly chargeable to the quota specified in the immigration visa, (3) is a nonquota immigrant if specified as such in the immigrant visa, (4) is the proper status on the quota specified in the immigrant visa, and then (5) is otherwise admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.133" offset="8955904">So again clearly the words otherwise admissible here is qualitative rather than quantitative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.911" offset="8987042">Now, Your Honor, example Section 5 without reading it entirely uses the word exactly the same way referring to it as quantitative exactly the same way referring to it as quantitative rather than qualitative.</text>

            <text syncTime="2443.477" offset="9877295">And we feel that since he has an absolute right and since he has established the roots in this country that Congress intended this legislation to protect that it is not like in one of your very recent cases where two seamen, I think it's one of the advance sheets of two seamen were here on a temporary visit and a woman was pregnant and the Court then held then that they just had one child and certainly they haven't established the roots necessary for the relief and that was a discretionary type relief anyway I think under 11 (c).</text>

            <text syncTime="3265.526" offset="13165484">Muriel May Scott, the petitioner in this proceeding is a native of Jamaica, the West Indies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.259" offset="13200384">She seeks reversal of the judgment below affirming a determination of the immigration service that should be deported from the United States because of the fraud perpetuated at entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.664" offset="13266004">This relief is being sought pursuant to Section 8 U.S.C. 1251 (f) and that she gave birth to and is the mother of a citizen of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.954" offset="13327235">The essential facts are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.470" offset="13341236">Petitioner then a native of Jamaica the British West Indies entered the United States on the non quota visa, that's nonquota immigrant visa issued to her as the wife of an American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.433" offset="13429112">That was in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.817" offset="13438621">In 1964 the immigration initiated proceedings against solely for the purpose of against petitioner charging that she had entered into the marriage ceremony which got solely for the purpose of qualifying for a nonquota immigrant visa with all the intention of establishing a bona fide marital relationship which she never established in fact subsequently thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.954" offset="13575189">The sole defense she raises to the case is that 1251 (f) prevents some deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.358" offset="13636838">A comment, an entry was excludable for deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.875" offset="13670902">That is why Section 1251 (f) is being raised as a defense 1251 (f) exempt persons that have obtained a visa by fraud or misrepresentation if they are otherwise admissible and they are the parent or child of a U.S. citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.534" offset="13813530">In the court below it was held that petitioner was qualified in entry respect except that there was no quota available to her because the quota from Jamaica was over subscribed at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.776" offset="13882493">This Court granted certiorari here and in Errico to resolve the differing interpretation says the Ninth Circuit held that the total defense was applicable and the Second Circuit did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.202" offset="13972146">The issue in this case is whether an alien who entered the United States as a non quota immigrant by means of a fraudulent marriage to a United States citizen who subsequently gave birth to a citizen child and was otherwise admissible at the time of entry and for the fraud in avoiding quota requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.918" offset="14103071">The question for this is whether or not this particular individual is subject to the safe provisions of Section 1251 (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.912" offset="14158973">It is our contention that the purpose and language of the statute negate the possibility that otherwise admissible was intended to encompass the availability of quota status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.588" offset="14225742">Well, before proceeding with my argument I certainly would like to answer Mr. Justice Brennan as to his question posed just before adjournment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.408" offset="14272972">Section 1182 (a) of the Immigration Act specifically has placed standards, there are 20 standards criteria.</text>

            <text syncTime="3822.326" offset="15392684">The American citizen can stay here even if she's -- if he's one month old” and I thought that was a horrible thing to do Your Honor because in every ordered law, you can go and appoint a guardian for an infant to take care of the infant's property or a guardian for the infant alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.217" offset="15464260">But on the immigration law, you cannot appoint a guardian for a child to petition a relief on the parent and I think that the Congress had exactly these situations in mind when they said that this statute has to be applicable as a total defense and that no discretion of the relief should be granted to the attorney general in situations like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.077" offset="15571675">With the exception of the fraud by which you obtain for nonquota visa, petitioner was qualified as a person otherwise admissible since he falls with none of the groups that I just recited to Your Honor, the political group, the mental group, the political group of agents proscribed from receiving a visa.</text>
            <text syncTime="3891.500" offset="15669373">However, the court below again says that Mrs. Scott is admissible in all other respect except that she is not otherwise admissible because there was no visa available for them because the British Honduras quota system for Jamaica was over subscribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.629" offset="15761847">We submit that this interpretation can only stand if you are prepared to attribute to Congress the intention of passing a law widely heralded as humanitarian which affects almost no one and which is inconsistent with other law's contemporaneously passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.833" offset="15846693">The act of 1957, the first part of Section 7 of the Act of 1957 was carried forward as Section 1251 (f) and it dealt with affording relief from deportation to those person that would be expelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.980" offset="15943241">The second sentence of the same act carried forward as Section 15 affords exclusion for non resident alien with the same familial status as to citizen situated as petitioner andif I may I'd like to read the statute, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.303" offset="16032580">“Any alien who is the spouse, parent or child of a United States citizen and who is excludable because (1) he seeks has sought to procure or has procured a visa or other documentation or entry to the United States by fraud or misrepresentation or (2) he admits the commission of perjury in connection therewith shall be granted a visa and admitted to the United States for permanent residents if otherwise admissible, if the attorney general in his discretion has consented to the aliens applying or reapplying for admission to the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.635" offset="16249919">This section using the same otherwise admissible language as the statute know before the Court for construction clearly and I emphasize that, it clearly does not contemplate the availability of a quota place since the familiar relationship which is the factor, which gives rise to the extension to the -- from excludability also confers nonquota or if you please preferred status upon the alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.493" offset="16389308">For us to attribute the Congress the intention of incorporating into the quota system the familial extension would mean that the more fatal the exemption is granted to aliens outside of the United States than aliens in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4091.864" offset="16470810">And what we're seeing that Congress is doing instead of tying the family together we are attributing the Congress that the Congress is saying now well, we are going to break up a family and the man that's out will bring that in and send the man that's out, and I cannot understand or think that Congress had planned to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4113.404" offset="16557014">It is inconceivable that the same otherwise admissible language should success a sentence of the 1957 Act promote a national policy of uniting a non-resident alien British American family and yet required a break up or immigration of the American family of a resident alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="4135.059" offset="16643636">It is all the more illogical to believe that Congress intended to compel expulsion without living any discretion to the attorney general to exempt certain individuals a discretion, if you please, which is given in the section where we don't want certain people from that are proscribed from receiving visas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4158.145" offset="16735901">It is true that the construction that we place upon the two statutes which stand in pari materia gives broader right of resident to the resident alien than the non-resident alien that is, we're taking the position by the attorney general's discretion is not involved in the form of situation but the only alternative that the governments render is the broader right to residence, for the non resident aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.992" offset="16871320">Now, if we look at the legislative history, Your Honor, nowhere in the history and I have worked on the history with a number of law students for a number of months and we have read and read and read many books, no clear reference to the meaning of the words otherwise admissible appears in any of the records or reports accompanying the 1957 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4223.003" offset="16995349">General reference to the effect by the entire 16 sections of the Act did not change the quota system were continuously made by Senator Eastland in the Senate and they were also made by Mr. -- Representative Celler and Chellos in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="4240.320" offset="17064626">On the other hand general reference to the effect that Section 7 was designed to leave hardship conditions were made by the then Senator Kennedy and Johnson and also by Senator Eastland.</text>
            <text syncTime="4256.196" offset="17128155">The general tenet of all references to the 1957 Act in the House Report and I quote here “indicate that the Congress intended to provide for a liberal treatment of children and was consumed to keeping families of the United States, of United States citizens immigrants united.</text>
            <text syncTime="4276.446" offset="17209135">Later in the House Reports, at page 10, 11, it stated that the exemption provision of Section 7 include the spouses, parents and children of United States citizens or lawfully resident aliens who may have misrepresented their place of birth, nationality, immigrant status and the like if their exclusion would work extreme hardship on their families in respect to extortion of aliens who are the spouses, parent, or children of United States citizens are lawfully resident aliens and who are already in the United States misrepresentation in obtaining documentation or entry would not be a ground for deportation if the alien will otherwise admissible at the time of entry.</text>

            <text syncTime="4585.044" offset="18443577">In the court below, the Government contended and the Court held that the otherwise admissible language included both qualitative and quantitative admissibility and availability of a quota placed at the time of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4600.072" offset="18503659">The effect of this interpretation is to relieve of the fraud or material representation only those aliens who never had to perpetuate a fraud to gain admission nor do we see House Section 241 (f) of the immigration law under the new law at the present time where 45,000 visas are allocated for each quarter that if a person which says it's a quarterly worldwide series for immigrants for the first three quarters of any -- this any person who enters in a particular quarter of the year in which this worldwide sealing is filled under the government's interpretation not otherwise be admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="4647.244" offset="18692368">However, if they waited until the fourth quarter when the other 45,000 visas were available and then make application and then he would automatically get a visa.</text>
            <text syncTime="4660.647" offset="18745971">In short, the Government's interpretation then of the exception provision either virtually meaningless or effectively according to a sliding scale of opportunity values which bears no relationship to Congress concerned for maintaining existing family unit.</text>

            <text syncTime="4727.500" offset="19013360">But the substance of it is that it is not limited to these cases because under the act which will become effective July 1 of 1968, the legislation provides a worldwide quota that still be an annual quota but it will be a worldwide one of 170,000 and a system of preferences and it appears that it also includes a limitation of 20,000 immigrants from anyone country per year so we still have the problem regardless of the removal of the existing quotas.</text>

            <text syncTime="4794.448" offset="19281168">On page 3 it's pointed out that her sister is also up for deportation and the -- it's being of course judicial review has been sought in this Court of Appeals and it's apparent that the Court of Appeals is waiting for this on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4815.267" offset="19364446">The -- I come again to the background of this Section 241 (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="4822.601" offset="19393808">And I noticed that counsel is using the same language as the Ninth Circuit about this automatic provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4833.486" offset="19437275">And as I understand, what's being argued here today is that if somebody has misrepresented a fact and they have anybody within the language of the statute they automatically remain here and I would assume that all you do in the case like that is file a marriage certificate or birth certificate and that's it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.432" offset="19545109">We've been invited to go through the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4865.252" offset="19564335">I briefly went over but I think we can do a little examining.</text>
            <text syncTime="4874.055" offset="19599548">The 1948 Act said in so many words that any person who willfully makes a misrepresentation for the purpose of gaining an admission shall thereafter be not admissible into the United States, ever.</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.369" offset="19668825">That was of course harsh language.</text>
            <text syncTime="4894.715" offset="19682200">As I pointed out this morning prior to that there was no grounds for mistakes and then in 1952 we had the softening of it that it continued on through but each one of the act as set out in our brief from the 48 Act up to the last one, there was no question they were lessening the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="4921.690" offset="19790137">In the act we now have in question was the effort to remove the complete harshness of the 48 bill as it was amended down the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="4933.329" offset="19836740">It was a harsh bill and I assume that that was the reason that it would appear to just the reading of the statute without the legislative history to assume that it was to be automatic.</text>
            <text syncTime="4949.848" offset="19902777">The statement has also been made that the phrase otherwise admissible is something new.</text>
            <text syncTime="4955.981" offset="19927333">It's in Section 241 (f), Section 211 (b), Section 211 (a), 212 (b), (e), (g), (h), (i) and etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.339" offset="19964740">It's also on the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4966.418" offset="19969024">I mean it's -- it's not a new language and it means the same thing it meant in the immigration law all along.</text>

            <text syncTime="6327.806" offset="25414614">Your Honor, I just want to answer your question there is a quota system for Latin America and that it is specified in the law that these people are special immigrants and in order to be a special immigrant they have to comply with certain formalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6346.900" offset="25490996">For example, no Latin American can come in this country or anybody from the West Indies at the present time unless they obtain a legal clearance certificate from the United States Department of Labor provided that they do not fall in any one of the exempted categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="6363.482" offset="25557347">Therefore, if Mrs. Scott goes back to Jamaica, I doubt that she will ever come back in the country and as to the five examples that Judge -- Mr. Justice Fortas has addressed himself before, I am practically saying to you, Your Honor that these examples are examples born of the discretionary relief that the attorney general already has so they really have no theory on Section 1251 (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="6390.471" offset="25665285">Here we are claiming that they we have a statute construction in which there are only two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6395.386" offset="25684929">One is in favor of the statute and the other one is against the statute and the legislative history shows that there was sympathy at the heart of Congress when they enacted the statute and I cannot see that this statute should not be given a rather total effect than rather discretionary effect which the attorney general was praying for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6417.527" offset="25773432">I have been before the immigration service for the last six or seven years for the Legal Aid Society and I find it really pathetic, Your Honors, if what's so impossible to see there is really a case that evokes sympathy and that sympathy is being materially denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="6434.288" offset="25840515">And you can't go to the federal court and say well this and this and this is this case but Your Honor has nothing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="6440.897" offset="25866951">Mr. Biervliet there's nothing that we can do for you.</text>
            <text syncTime="6444.067" offset="25879594">The service had not abused their authority so therefore you have no case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6449.839" offset="25902686">The service is affirmed and it's in that spirit that I am calling here to ask for help from this Court because I think we should really help Mrs. Scott.</text>
            <text syncTime="6459.946" offset="25943124">Thank you very kindly.</text>
