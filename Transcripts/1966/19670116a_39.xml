            <text syncTime="47.747" offset="294327">This case is before the Court on a writ of certiorari from the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.358" offset="328808">It involves a question of the interpretation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the petitioners here plaintiffs below are group of drug companies who were confronted with a mandatory enforcement regulation which they believe was issued beyond the statute and beyond the authority of the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare and the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.574" offset="469661">Accordingly, they filed a suit in the District Court at Wilmington under the declaratory judgment of the statute and the Administrative Procedure Act asking for relief from the mandatory enforced with requirements of this particular regulation alleging that they were seriously injured in their business in any way which I will refer to later in some more detail.</text>

            <text syncTime="122.040" offset="591496">Declaratory judgment and an injunction Mr. Justice Stewart under the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.591" offset="617723">The case was heard on cross motions for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.134" offset="631933">There are no facts in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.927" offset="647084">It's a pure issue of law as to what this particular section of the statute means.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.192" offset="680103">All administrative proceedings are over.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.959" offset="695254">These petitioners or plaintiffs stand in the posture where they must conform with this regulation which they consider invalid or they must get to redress through this action in the Court or await being sued. If they simply await being sued and undertake to exist that they are paroled, they will be subject to criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.591" offset="817716">They will be subject to civil proceedings in the way of injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.998" offset="835375">They will be subject to seizure, indeed multiple seizure, of their products.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.797" offset="862542">And they are also subject to what perhaps is the most reprehensible situation of all which undoubtedly some members of the Court would be familiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.431" offset="905070">The indirect enforcement power of this agency to deny company's opportunity to put drugs on the market or denied on certifications and in other petty administrative ways prevent companies that wish to challenge this legislation from going about their otherwise lawful and normal business.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="221.598" offset="989811">Reprehensible, Mr. Gessell?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gerhard_a_gessell" startTime="223.330" stopTime="684.141">
            <label>Mr. Gerhard A. Gessell</label>
            <text syncTime="223.330" offset="996707">I think it's seriously reprehensible Mr. Justice Fortas.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.864" offset="1010813">The indirect type of enforcement of that kind puts a company in a position where it is unable to get the type of hearing which our type of society contemplates should be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.528" offset="1085524">Now, the issue here is I believe quite narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.167" offset="1116035">In the District Court, the District Court found that the companies had standing to sue that there was a right to bring an action under the declaratory judgment statute, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the District Judge then proceeded to the merits and held that the plaintiffs were correct with respect to the interpretations of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.625" offset="1229824">When the Government took the matter to the Third Circuit, the Third Circuit did not come to the issue on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.446" offset="1265142">The Third Circuit took the position that the Food and Drug Act did not provide a basis for a suit such as has been brought here and held that the controversy was not right that there was no threatened, haste or controversy and that therefore the action was premature.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.211" offset="1348211">And petitioners lost in the Court of Appeals on that ground without the Court of Appeals coming to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.509" offset="1377364">We accordingly are here on a – cert was granted on a procedural question as to the whether or not a case or controversy exists in the face of this allegedly illegal regulation and whether the statute permits if there is a right of controversy as we feel there is, whether the statute permits this particular type of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.160" offset="1496064">Now, the regulation in issue is designated by the defendants as an enforcement statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.347" offset="1540786">It is immediately operative and it applies to all prescription drugs and to all companies selling prescription drugs throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.038" offset="1591568">It is mandatory in its terms, it is stated in the words of command and it directs compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.077" offset="1635662">And the statute is so worded and the regulation is so worded that if a company chooses not to comply, its drugs will be deemed misbranded and accordingly all of the consequences that flow upon a misbranded article under the statute criminal, civil and other types of sanctions apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.513" offset="1745377">The particular regulation in issue is a regulation that directs that in the case of a prescription drug whether a label be used or an advertisement be used any type of printed literature of any kind every time the brand name or trade name of the drug is used, that must appear opposite the generic name that is to say the technical name of the particular drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.555" offset="1885602">The agency takes the position that the provisions of 502 (e) (1) of the statute which are printed at page 4 (a) of my main brief if the Court please requires this interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.095" offset="1951744">We take the position that the statute requires only that there be prominent display of the generic name and that there is no requirement that that name appear every time, all the time whenever the brand name appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.428" offset="2025096">It is Mr. Chief Justice, as all were -- we had briefs before Your Honor here with some 40 plaintiffs and every time we said “petitioners” we put a parenthesis in and spelled out the names of the 40 different companies that are before you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.007" offset="2083401">Now, the -- the injury that is facing this industry is of several types.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.763" offset="2134392">They are not only facing these sanctions but they would be required under these regulations to change their materials, to undergo addition expense, to publish a type of literature that would be certainly at the least confusing and far less effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.116" offset="2219865">We think the controversy is clearly right for adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.970" offset="2255287">The statute's directions are explicit and the question presented is a mere and simple question as to whether or not the statute reads the way the Food and Drug Administration says it reads.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.771" offset="2322474">There's an impact that is clearly adverse on the business of these petitioners, the regulation controls the manner in which they have to conduct their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.343" offset="2368763">It sets a standard of conduct and there are no further administrative proceedings or any other thing of that kind to which they can advert.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.301" offset="2420590">The government says there's an exemption provision but that is not the case, the exemption provision does not read with respect to the advertising aspects of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.515" offset="2465416">So this problem, this horns of the dilemma officer's choice or which you want to call it, that confronts these companies is a realistic, actual and immediate type of controversy from which the only relief that they can seek is by asking for declaratory judgment and protection under the Administrative Procedure Act unless they simply want to sit back and face the penalty uncertain as to time, uncertain as to his business consequences, certain to contain highly adverse publicity, certain to bring discredit upon the company if they're sued in one form or another in some manner or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.740" offset="2650363">Now, we have a very interesting situation here after the Court of Appeals in our case held that the controversy was not right, the companion case to be argued next came before the Second Circuit and there Judge Friendly dealt with the very problem that I'm dealing with here, discussed in specific detail, the decision in our Third Circuit case and held quite contrary to the Third Circuit that -- and in the manner in which we say is the appropriate type of holding here that the controversy was right, that there was a judiciable controversy, and that it should be determined now and not at some later time.</text>

            <text syncTime="689.228" offset="2860283">On the question of the rightness Mr. Justice Stewart, of the controversy, there are substantial differences between the two proceedings (Voice Overlap) but on the questions of whether this type of threat from a regulation creates a right controversy, there was agreement -- there is agreement, and the two cases are all the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="734.244" offset="3040319">In our situation, unlike theirs, there is no confusion as to the meaning of the statute in its – or the regulation in its operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.193" offset="3076159">There is no further proceedings before any court, there is nothing to determine except what this statutes means.</text>

            <text syncTime="1052.232" offset="4312273">Well, Your Honor I think the reason for it, I think it isn't extraordinary because it is confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.359" offset="4336828">But I think the reason -- the reason for it is that the Secretary has taken the position from the beginning that this is the only interpretation which the statute permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.239" offset="4388342">This is not an economic regulation, this is not a regulation dealing with questions of safety, this is not a regulation that says, we really think we have to do this in our expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.326" offset="4436720">This is a regulation that issues because he says, this is what the statute means, it's the only thing it means, and this is the way it has to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.299" offset="4472560">Now, I would also say this in response to Your Honor's question that where you have issues of fact and I would think perhaps that would be the case in many of the type of situation you postulated, this statute provides that there has to be, in the rule making process, an evidentiary type hearing and then that is reviewed by a Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.404" offset="4572975">We have now an evidence -- any underlying evidentiary hearing for this regulation whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.623" offset="4593873">This is just a mandatory direction from the Secretary as to how he proposes to enforce this particular provision of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.328" offset="4640684">And since there is nothing on which to take testimony, nothing on which to concern ourselves except what the statute means, it seems to me that this is the way an industry should be proceed to get a standard rule of conduct determined when the Secretary attempts to impose that illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.643" offset="4745906">And it's -- it's rather amusing here that when the defendants here are turned in an -- because they're rather troubled by this decision of the Third Circuit, they don't support it in many particulars, when they turn to the question of the merits which was not before the Court in the cert petition but they say, “Well, why don't -- why don't you decide the merits while you're here”, they say this is a simple case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.160" offset="4860008">There's no controversy, the public interest requires it to be promptly determined, and let's go at it and decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.770" offset="4894490">And I almost wondered whether the same person wrote the first part of the brief that wrote the second part because you can't -- in the context of this case, there is nothing in our -- to argue about as to the meaning of the regulation, as to the reasons for the regulation, and it's a pure question of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.298" offset="4992606">The other aspect of our case concerns whether or not Congress precluded this type of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.091" offset="5035760">And I would like in few brief moments to deal with that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.298" offset="5076616">We have in this statute a saving's clause which states the remedies provided for at this subsection, this is on page 6 (a) of my appendix shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any other remedies provided by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.411" offset="5173060">The entire legislative history is full of discussion about the right to bring injunctive actions, declaratory judgment actions, no report of Congress, no words in the statute are designed in any way to say that the Administrative Procedure Act and the Declaratory Judgment Act do not apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.439" offset="5289148">And we are unable to see how particularly in the face of the saving clause which we believe has general application and the debates that one can say that Congress must have intended, the Government says or we must assume they say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.908" offset="5370964">Well, there's no basis for such assumptions, no basis for that intention, and that the literature of this Court is full of declarations that say we want a favor the right of citizens to review actions of regulatory bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.551" offset="5453615">And I would like just for a moment before you adjourn for lunch to leave this thought with you, I've been mitigating around this country a good deal in the last few years and it's a surprising thing to see the number of times, the Government is seeking to prevent a fair test of their power or their right to do something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.009" offset="5567404">They raise sovereign immunity, they raise standing to sue, they raise venue questions, they raise questions of who should be the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.254" offset="5600423">And the atmosphere was not unlike that with I heard in this Court last Thursday with respect to the question of this Court's mandate in El Paso.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.313" offset="5640652">The fact of the matter is this Government attitude is that we want to have it our way, we want to make businessmen knuckle under and comply to illegal regulations because we have all these indirect and subversive opportunities to force compliance, and we hope that everybody relied on, we hope that everybody will not challenge the statute that enough people will be frightened to adhere to the regulation even when it's invalid and thus we'll have a long period of administrative compliance which will support the regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4031.962" offset="16231215">And as far as multiple seizures are concerned there is plenty opportunity here to seize the drugs in any number of company at the same time, one company, three companies, five companies, 20 companies and the Government is trying to keep total chance to pick and choose to move to determine its strategy hoping in the meantime that by this jawbone enforcement, as Mr. Justice Douglas suggested, people will comply even though they probably clearly in view with the District Judge have gone beyond the law.</text>
