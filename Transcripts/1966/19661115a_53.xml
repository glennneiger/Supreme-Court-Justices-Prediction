            <label>Mr. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="9.043" offset="139577">Mr. Chief Justice and may have pleased the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.229" offset="152325">This case here on the read of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit presents a question related to the one that was before the Court yesterday in the Acme case.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.006" offset="191404">Here, a union filed with the National Labor Relations Board a charge that an employer had failed to bargain in violation of Section 985 Act, because of certain unilateral changes in wages that the employer had made during the term of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.933" offset="279071">The employer offered as a defense, that what he had done was sanctioned by the terms of the collective bargaining contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.726" offset="314284">And the question presented in the case is whether in order to determine the unfair labor practice charge, the National Labor Relations Board has authority to interpret the collective bargaining agreement rather than as the Court of Appeals held, the board is required to re-meet the parties to a judicial lawsuit in order to have that issue determine because in this case, unlike the Acme case, the contract does not contain an arbitration provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.752" offset="442389">The company is a manufacturer of plywood and the employees involved here are members of something called a ““glue spreader”” crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.480" offset="477288">This is a group of employees who glues together the various pieces of the wood that combine to make the finished piece of plywood.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.220" offset="512293">The crew ordinarily consists of four employees and these four employees have broken down into three different categories of workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.586" offset="553671">The company ended into a collective bargaining agreement with the Union under which particular wages was set for each of these three different jobs in the “glue spreader” crew, rending from $2.15 to $2.29 an hour, and the contract also provided that during its term, the wages would be closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.623" offset="653876">Paragraph 17 of the contract, which is a critical paragraphing above here and set forth at the bottom of page 67 of the record, after stating that the employer and the Union had agreed upon a classified wage scale which was incorporated in the contract went on to state that the employer reserves the right to pay a premium rate over and above the contractual classified wage rights to reward any particular employee for some special fitness, skill, aptitude or the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.281" offset="796505">Three weeks after this contract had been signed, without consulting a bargaining with the Union, the company inaugurated what it called a premium pay plan for the “glue spreaders”.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.035" offset="851466">That plan is set forth to page 73 of the record, and what it provided in essence was that whenever, in any particular one-week period, the glue crew, the four members, exceeded a certain production quota, each member of the crew was to get not the schedule rate in the contract that a higher amount of $2.15 an hour, every member of the crew was to get this.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.395" offset="948955">It was not tied to the performance of any individual person.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.847" offset="966719">The Union found out about this plan when a member of the Union brought a copy of the thing and the Union and the company then met on two occasions in which the Union protested that this proposed glue spreader plan was not justified under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement as the Union explained to the company in its view that this was not just a change in wages but a basic change in the method of computing wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.915" offset="1083016">It was not just giving a premium but involved a shift in computing wages from a straight alley basis to a production basis and therefore, in the Union's view is not justified by the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.216" offset="1128260">The company on the other hand, contended that it was justified by the contract and refused to cancel the plan and then the Union filed a charge with the Board alleging that the company engaged in an unfair labor practice by instituting this plan.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="271.306" offset="1188551">Has the company ever claimed that this action would not have been an unfair labor practice even if there had been no premium pay provision on the contract?</text>

            <label>Mr. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="281.365" offset="1228884">I don't believe so Mr. Justice that the whole controversy from the company's point of view has turned on their claim that under this provision of the contract, it was -- they were justified in what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.573" offset="1285622">The -- at the full usual administrative proceedings, the Board held that in initiating this premium pay plan, the company had refused to bargain in violation of Section 8 (a)(5) and it entered an order in effect directing the company not to institute such a plan without first bargaining with the Union and if the Union were to request it to resend the particular plan that it had inaugurated.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.722" offset="1394291">The Board rejected the company's contention that it lacked jurisdiction to determine the unfair labor practice because in order to do so, it would have to interpret the terms of the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="334.099" offset="1439744">So what would be the Government's position if these two parties in fact really agreed to permit the Government or permit the employer to raise wages whenever he wanted to?</text>

            <text syncTime="352.238" offset="1512364">Well this would -- this Mr. Justice would present a difficult problem which I will come to the implication to this in a minute because our basic position in this case is that an employer cannot, without bargaining with the Union under Section 8 (a)(5) unilaterally change terms and conditions of employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.233" offset="1608286">Well, the Union has the right to waive rights under the contract and the question in that case would be, whether what was done was sufficient in all the circumstances to constitute a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.969" offset="1659277">There have been as was suggested yesterday's argument that the Board's power to deal with unfair labor practices under Section 10 (a) is not limited by any other existing remedy and the question would be whether in all the circumstances, the --</text>

            <text syncTime="405.071" offset="1723643">Well in this particular case, if a court or this Court found that this factual provision justified the plan that the employer -- covered the plan, that the employer actually put in, would the Government -- is that in the case as far as you are concerned?</text>

            <text syncTime="458.579" offset="1937638">If -- if this Court would hold that this provision of the contract does not -- does permit this plan, I would seem that that would be the end of the case but what I'm suggesting Mr. Justice is --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="467.858" stopTime="474.553">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="467.858" offset="1974836">Well, I know that's -- that's my question.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="friedman" startTime="474.553" stopTime="734.809">
            <label>Mr. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="474.553" offset="2001586">And then I'm coming back a moment to what the Board held in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.308" offset="2016632">It pointed out that it has frequently interpreted contracts in performing its functions under the Act and in this particular case, there was no proceeding had been invoked by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.076" offset="2071698">There was no pending arbitration proceeding either before a court or an arbitrator and therefore the reasons which sometimes lead the Board to defer to the tendency of another proceeding were not present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.074" offset="2127705">The Board then turned, went on an interpreted a particular contract and it concluded on the basis of its examination of the language of the contract and the negotiations between the parties that the purpose of this provision, this premium pay plan, was only to give the employer the right to make individual merit increases for the special competence of a particular employee but not to select a group of employees and unilaterally to change the basic method of compensating them from a straight time basis to a production basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.262" offset="2260407">And in reaching this conclusion, the Board concluded that what had been done by the Union in this case did not amount to a waiver on its part of the right to bargain about what it called a wage incentive system.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.948" offset="2319130">The Court of Appeals refused to enforce the Board's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.745" offset="2334386">It stated its problems, it said, since the existence or nonexistence of an unfair labor practice, does not turn entirely upon the provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.948" offset="2371166">But arguably upon a good faith dispute as to the correct meaning of the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, the Board had no jurisdiction to proceed because it said, whether or not this contract authorize what the company had done, was a matter to be decided by an arbitrator if there was an arbitration provision or if no such provision to be adjudicated by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.039" offset="2463535">Now, the answer I think we can fairly say that we and the respondent are in common ground on two general propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.939" offset="2495091">First, that the Board has no general authority to enforce collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.855" offset="2522781">And secondly, that the mere breach of a collective bargaining agreement of itself is not enough to create and give rise to an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.818" offset="2558621">Will we part company with the respondent in this case is when it argues that here, basically the unfair labor practice rest upon the breach of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.621" offset="2605850">We think that is not the basis here.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.353" offset="2612746">That here, the unfair labor practice rested on the company's failure to perform its duty to bargain with the employer -- with the Union before making any material changes in terms and conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.122" offset="2667813">I think the Board stated its philosophy of the decision in this case very well at the bottom page 96, where it said that in filing its unfair labor practice, the Union was complaining not of a violation of its contract with respondent but of the invasion of its statutory right as collective bargaining representative of employees in the unit to bargain about any changes in the terms and condition of employment for such employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.895" offset="2774915">So as we see the case here, basically, we think it involves three issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.654" offset="2789961">One, whether apart from the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, what the employer did here constituted is the refusal to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.405" offset="2824965">Two, whether the Board was authorized in itself interpreting the contract rather than leaving it to the parties to go to court, and three, whether in the fact to this case, the Board's interpretation of the contract was proper one.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.807" offset="2878568">Now I'd like the first turn of the threshold issue of refusal to bargain which as far as I can tell the respondent does not challenged here but since this is the keystone of the Board's decision, I think it's a accordant to deal with it briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.910" offset="2934993">The duty with Section 8 (a)(5) imposes on an Employer and a Union to bargain collectively is defined in Section 8 (d) as the performance of the mutual obligation of the Employer and the Union to meet at reasonable times and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment for a negotiation of any agreement or any question arising there under.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="734.809" offset="3042617">Now, the employer here as I understand it says, “We did bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.633" offset="3061948">We did bargain in good faith and we provided in our collective bargaining agreement for our liberty to do just what we did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.581" offset="3089742">And when you're asking us not to bargain about this, it's you, the Union who is in bad faith because we bargained about that and reach to an agreement.”</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="friedman" startTime="755.870" stopTime="775.254">
            <label>Mr. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="755.870" offset="3126836">Well that Mr. Justice, the Union -- it isn't that the Union is asking the Employer to bargain -- our position is that during the term of the collective bargaining agreement, if the employer attempts unilaterally without bargaining with the Union to make any substantial modifications in that thing, he cannot do it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="775.254" stopTime="785.027">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="775.254" offset="3204368">Well of course, the employer's position is, I'm not making any modifications in the contract, I'm simply doing what I was permitted to do as a result of our previous collective bargaining.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="friedman" startTime="785.027" stopTime="789.479">
            <label>Mr. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="785.027" offset="3243447">That's right, but that I would suggest Mr. Justice is a defense basically.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.777" offset="3258493">This is something you --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="789.479" stopTime="793.990">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="789.479" offset="3261315">Well, what I wonder what the point of collective bargaining is, if you can never reach a bargain that sticks.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="friedman" startTime="793.990" stopTime="939.207">
            <label>Mr. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="793.990" offset="3279287">Well, you can Mr. Justice if they had reached the bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.043" offset="3291512">But the question in the case is whether what the Union agreed to in this case, in effect gave the employer authority to make this kind of a change which the employer says he did have.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.632" offset="3337906">And we say that on the circumstances it did not authorize the employer to make a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.029" offset="3355460">But we further say that in deciding whether there has been a refusal to bargain here, the Board is authorized to examine the basis on which the employer purported to justify what he had done.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.505" offset="3417422">Now, this as was developed also during the argument in the preceding case the duty of the bargaining we think clearly is not limited just to working out the initial terms of the collective bargaining agreement that continues during the life of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.600" offset="3481788">Now, four years ago in the Katz case, this Court held that where during negotiations, an employer unilaterally and without consulting with the Union, made significant changes in the rights of pay in sick leave, that that constituted a refusal to bargain without regard to the employer's good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.801" offset="3574575">And as I put it in so holding that such unilateral changes said, frustrates the objectives of Section 8(a)(5) much as does a flat refusal to negotiate at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.507" offset="3621386">And we think the same reasoning requires that during the term of a collective agreement, after the agreement has been added on into, similarly, neither side can make unilateral changes without conferring with the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.631" offset="3677915">The basic philosophy of the whole concept of requiring collective bargaining embodied in 8(a)(5), is that industrial peace will be furthered.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.009" offset="3715427">If the parties to a contract before making changes get together and talk about it, they don't have to reach agreement that's explicit in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.206" offset="3748237">But we think they do have to get together and talk about it and therefore, the philosophy of the statute is neither side can make significant changes in the basic employment relationship, the terms and conditions of employment without first considering, without first consulting and discussing it with the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.691" offset="3822111">Now in this case, we think it's very clearly that the change that the employer made was a significant change.</text>

            <text syncTime="1073.643" offset="4397955">But in this case, the Board did not go that far and at the present time, quite frankly, the Board's thinking in this, on this subject is in a developing area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.500" offset="4433377">But as far as this case is concerned, as far as this order is concerned, all of this order requires the company to do is to bargain with the employee -- with the Union before inaugurating this plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.748" offset="4486353">Now I like to come back to a minute to the significance of the change that was made here, because I think this is very critical.</text>

            <text syncTime="1218.371" offset="4976828">I won't labor because it was discussed considerably yesterday the statutory language itself in Section 10 (a) which provides that the Board's power to deal with unfair labor practices should not be in any way affected by other means of adjustment or prevention established by agreement law or otherwise because it seems very clear to us that if the Board is not authorized to interpret a collective bargaining agreement, when it comes to pass on an unfair labor practice, its power to prevent such practices would be affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.314" offset="5116635">For one thing, it's just a matter of the time it takes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.243" offset="5132309">The parties have to first go and institute a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.031" offset="5143489">It's bound to take a lot longer than the Board the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.005" offset="5155401">Indeed the Court of Appeals itself recognized this but said, it didn't think that made any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.090" offset="5179747">It's also significant we think that this proviso of the Section 10 (a) was part of the original Wagner Act and in the legislative history of the 1947 Labor Management Act, Congress consciously decided to retain this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.165" offset="5244008">And in so doing, it stated that the remedies before the Board to deal with an unfair labor practice were intended to be in addition to and not in lieu of with other -- what other remedies might be available in another forum.</text>

            <text syncTime="1494.305" offset="6080554">But in determining that the question, the ultimate question in terms of interpreting the contract, is whether when the Union agreed that the employer could have the right to pay a premium pay over and above the contractual classified rate to award any employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.931" offset="6151084">The question in that instance is whether this authorized them to inaugurate a plan covering groups of employees, changing the basis or merely to single out a particular employee and say, “You employee Brown, you are very skilled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.168" offset="6208031">We're going to pay you not $2.25 but $2.40.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.807" offset="6222555">As I might add, there was an instance, there was one employee that the record shows, but why at the time of this -- time for this negotiation was being paid the premium rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.813" offset="6258604">He was getting $2.40 although the contract was $2.29.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.650" offset="6273964">Now, we would suggest that in answering that question, it's not enough just to look at the particular terms of the contract when what you're trying to find out is whether in doing this thing, the employer has violated his duty to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.411" offset="6348988">Because the whole question it seems to us is so intertwined with the subject of collective bargaining with the Federal Labor Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.385" offset="6388903">That to answer this question calls to something more than just the kind of analysis that a court would traditionally make in interpreting the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.080" offset="6427669">They come into play -- it comes into play for example, the well-settled rule under the National Labor Relations Act that the courts have repeatedly upheld, that a waiver of statutory rights will not be implied unless it is clearly and unquestionably set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.495" offset="6501334">Now, we have here a history of bargaining negotiations between the Employer and the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.988" offset="6531323">And in the course of these negotiations on one or two occasions, some reference was made to the employer considering the inauguration of a premium paid plan for the “glue spreader” crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.722" offset="6590255">There's nothing -- and one of the instance the Union said, nothing on the other instance when the employer referred to the fact that another company in the area had proposed such a plan but had withdrawn it when that Union objected, the Union representative said they couldn't agree to such a thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1682.269" offset="6832462">The Board in carrying out its statutory duties to determine unfair labor practices made to that extent interprets the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1704.172" offset="6920025">There may be many situations where the violation of a collective bargaining agreement will give rise both to a possible action of breach of contract and to an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.866" offset="6962866">And of course the Board -- this is not the only area where the Board has to interpret collective bargaining agreements that --</text>

            <text syncTime="1720.909" offset="6987003">So they find now whether the Board has power in the particular circumstances to interpret a collective bargaining agreement, you've got to find out -- you've got to go to the end of the process and say, “How did it interpret it for a work purpose and with work consequences?”</text>

            <text syncTime="1744.286" offset="7080521">And as I say, that the Board for example, that there are certain portions of the statute where the mere entering into of a particular type of collective bargaining agreement is unfair labor practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1765.430" offset="7165053">Similarly when on the Board has to determine a dispute -- a representation dispute on the 10(a), it traditionally interprets the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2048.815" offset="8298663">That issue is, does the National Labor Relations Board have the right and jurisdiction to adjudicate an unfair labor practice when it sole and only basis for doing so is to interpret and construe the collective bargaining agreement of the parties?</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.688" offset="8366164">We are convinced it does not have that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.156" offset="8384031">Counsel for the Solicitor General has pointed out the pertinent provision of the contract upon which the employer relied throughout these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.956" offset="8415169">Namely, the contract after setting forth a classified wage scale went on and stated, “To the employer reserves the right to pay a premium pay over and above the contractual classified wage rate -- excuse me, to reward any particular employee for some especial skill, fitness skill aptitude and the like.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2174.770" offset="8802408">To continue this Court through Justice Douglas stated, “Collective bargaining agreements regulate or restrict the exercise of management functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.654" offset="8842010">They do not oust management from the performance of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.667" offset="8857997">Management hires and fires, pays and promotes, supervises and plans, all of these are a part of its function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.289" offset="8892479">And absent a collective bargaining agreement, it may be exercised freely as limited by public law and by the willingness of employees to work under the particular unilaterally imposed conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2296.452" offset="9289226">Here, the Board seeks to exercise the authority to administer and interpret a labor contract under a refusal to bargain unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.565" offset="9325589">Yet neither the language of the statute nor the legislative history authorizes this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.731" offset="9350248">The language of the refusal to bargain unfair labor practice was the same in the original Wagner Act passed in 1935 as it is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.274" offset="9384417">In 1946 and 1947, Congress was very concerned with the usurpation of authority by the Board under this particular provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.811" offset="9418585">And we add at no time in that period, prior to 1946 and 1947, had the Board gone as far as it has gone in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.890" offset="9466964">Attention is directed to the respondents brief at page 38, footnote 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.516" offset="9489429">There, we have a very cryptic analysis of the House Committee on Education and Labor in which that committee pointed out, “Unless Congress rights into the law guides for the Board to follow, the Board may attempt to carry this process still further to seek to control more and more of the terms of collective bargaining agreements.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.391" offset="9584933">As a consequence, Congress did not leave it to the Board to make this determination and in Section 8(d) chose to define the terms to bargain collectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.242" offset="9624325">In doing so, it is our belief that what Congress sought to do was to create an atmosphere under which collective bargaining could thrive, not to determine the terms of the agreement itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.899" offset="9675003">The clause or the section itself points out that the obligation to bargain should not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.005" offset="9723382">Congress also went out -- went on at great lengths to spell out the rights and the duties involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.672" offset="9754102">The legislative history of this statute shows that the Senate in 1947, in the Bill it passed provided that the violation of a collective bargaining agreement would be an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.638" offset="9805928">But when the Bill got into conference, the House is not having a comparable provision prevailed and that portion of the legislation was dropped.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.504" offset="9857337">It is clear that the refusal to bargain unfair labor practice was not intended to encompass contract administration as is further evidenced by the remarks of the manager of the Senate Conferees, the late Senator Robert Taft which is quoted in our respondents brief at pages 49 and 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.169" offset="9940093">He knows it that while the Senate Conferees yielded on the elimination of the violation of contract, unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.867" offset="9986800">They retained their other amendment which was new to the Act namely Section 301, which authorizes federal court jurisdiction and labor contract controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.788" offset="10026506">He concluded, “If both provisions had remained,” that is both the violation of contract unfair labor practice and Section 301, “there would have been a probable conflict of remedies and decisions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.739" offset="10098291">That is -- thus, it is clear that Congress did not concede that there would be a conflict of remedies and decisions by leaving in the refusal to bargain unfair labor practice, at the same time that Section 301 was enacted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2836.773" offset="11450493">The conclusion that Congress did not intend that the Board should have the right to interpret construe and force or administer labor contract either indirectly or directly is also evidenced by the fact the 73rd Congress in 1934, the Congress immediately preceding the 74th which in 1935 passed the Wagner Act, amended the Railway Labor Act establishing the National Railroad Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.292" offset="11568567">In that Legislation, Congress spelled out that the National Railroad Adjustment Board was to have jurisdiction to resolve the speech between employees, unions and carriers growing out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of railroad labor agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.830" offset="11642650">If Congress had intended that the National Labor Relations Board surely involve itself in the administration of labor contract, it certainly had the skill and the precedent on how to write such a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.843" offset="11694791">Since Congress did not choose to apply even remotely the language used to establish the jurisdiction of the National Railroad Adjustment Board to the National Labor Relations Board, it is conclusive that Congress did not intend that the National Labor Relations Board should exercise the authority that it search here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.477" offset="11777233">The refusal to bargain unfair labor practice has been stated in the same language from the inception of this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.129" offset="11803878">Yet, in well over 25 years, through ever changing personnel of different political motivations, no effort was made by the Board to assert itself in a situation such as this until 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.162" offset="11864064">And the decisions of the Courts in all Circuits to date, so far as I can find, are in complete harmony with the viewpoint that prevailed in the Board prior to 1964.</text>

            <text syncTime="3383.567" offset="13637674">The Board argument runs that it is entitled to construe the provisions of a labor contract when such construction is necessary to vindicate statutory unfair labor practices when we realized that almost every provision of a labor contract in one sense or another governs, wages outs in working conditions, we can see that the Board can reason its way into almost every dispute over an interpretation of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.340" offset="13744776">It can weigh the respective interpretations and if the construction that it chooses, it is an unfair labor practice, then in their opinion then they can find that an unfair labor practice exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.554" offset="13789602">As we view it and we pointed out in our brief some appropriate statistics, the Board claims it is overburdened now.</text>

            <text syncTime="3434.072" offset="13839653">To open wide the doors that this case would open wide simply would add to the burden of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.946" offset="13895137">One last point, we also feel that industrial stability will result from the Board's unwarranted invasion of contract administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.472" offset="13941217">The Board is now saying that an employer's action which if the Board determines, he's not allowed by a labor agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.894" offset="13970996">That is a contract violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.136" offset="13979878">Constitutes an 8 (a)(5) or a refusal to bargain unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.730" offset="13998268">In the Ma -- in the Mastro Plastics case this Court held at most “no strike” clauses do not bar a strike which is occasioned by an employer's unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.272" offset="14044453">Any claim of violation, employer violation of a labor agreement, that is any grievance, may thus justify the Union to legally strike in spite of a no strike clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.049" offset="14103594">This, we believe, will only create chaos not stability in the -- American industrial scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.882" offset="14146853">To permit the bar to interpret contracts under circumstances such as exists here, clearly circumvents the language of the statute and the manifest congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.197" offset="14196172">The Board should not be permitted to indirectly accomplish a purpose which has no direct authorization in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.084" offset="14227728">To grant the Board request, we believe, is tantamount to poisoning compulsory arbitration upon American industry when Congress made it very clear that it did not approved of compulsory arbitration of the settlement of labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.531" offset="14289481">It is respectfully submitted that the decision of the Court of Appeals in this matter was correct.</text>
