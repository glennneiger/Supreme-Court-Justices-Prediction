            <text syncTime="30.912" offset="227035">As the issues are presented by the United States, Grosso, the case that initially seemed very unlike, they're related of course to Marchetti, has now become virtually the same case since the United States no longer relies on the distinction drawn in Kahriger and Lewis between perspective and the past acts a distinction that might have divided these two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.346" offset="344795">Instead as I understand the Government's position at the present time it puts its reliance on the voluntariness of the choice to gamble and on the need for accommodation between the taxing power, the privilege arguments that of course have felled and is equally to the excise tax of the occupational tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.941" offset="443120">The word accommodation is a fine word and the notion that both the taxing power and the privilege are contained within the constitution and each of these are of great importance for our country and should be preserved as of course a matter in which we make common cause with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.435" offset="521070">Where we disagree is how you do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.529" offset="533504">At page 13 of its brief the Government talks of striking a balance between these two constitutional powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.288" offset="572479">This is -- many areas of constitutional law of course, a very controversial phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.889" offset="598915">But I'd suppose that at least with regard to the Fifth Amendment and its privilege against self-incrimination that there was no room to balance out the constitutional protection in order to serve some other governmental aim.</text>

            <text syncTime="629.376" offset="2620897">It seems to me that their first suggestion that we have a suitable accommodation in Kahriger and Lewis is an accommodation that leaves the Fifth Amendment out entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.421" offset="2665096">That it is reading into the Fifth Amendment the exception to which Mr. Justice Black worded this morning, that no one need to be a witness against himself except where a tax is involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="660.956" offset="2747225">The alternative, the use restriction is apparently consisted with the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="679.720" offset="2822248">As we've argued in our briefs into several members of the Court has suggested, we do not think that it is an accommodation that it is for this Court to adopt in the circumstances of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="754.443" offset="3121194">There is nothing that either side can find in view of the statute -- the regulations of prohibiting disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.512" offset="3153377">The practice we are told by the Government is that in some instances, disclosure is made with regard to the excise tax and we have in our original brief cited a number of examples in which the Government had in fact given state authorities copies of the Form 730.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.649" offset="3249925">If there is to be a use restriction then for the reasons I suggest, we think that is properly a congressional choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.448" offset="3289213">And I must say I'm so much surprised that the argument the Government made is to why this is an appropriate case in -- for the Court to invent a use restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.543" offset="3329546">In the first briefs, we said that if a use restriction is something appropriately within the power of this Court to invent on its own, then a great many famous cases from Counselman and Hitchcock down to Albertson were wrongly decided because these were cases in which Congress have tried to provide immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.472" offset="3397256">It hadn't gone far enough and instead of saying, "We'll restrict the use", the Court has said, "No, the statute is unconstitutional".</text>
            <text syncTime="831.259" offset="3428394">At page 22 I believe, his initial brief, the United States undertakes to distinguish this by saying that in the Counselman or Albertson situation, Congress has focused its attention on the Fifth Amendment problems in a particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.000" offset="3499342">While with regard to the wagering tax it says and I think quite rightly that when the Congress adopted the wagering tax, it wasn't thinking at all about Fifth Amendment problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.683" offset="3538108">Those were the days when state incrimination of course was thought not to matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.038" offset="3555558">But this seems them to lead to the paradoxical position that if Congress has thought about Fifth Amendment problems and try to anticipate them and to protect people but has not used in just the right words to do it, then we strike out the congressional statutes since they have tried again but if Congress hasn't thought about it at all, the tenets for the Court to think about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.043" offset="3643538">I suggest that this is -- would not be a sensible or a tenable position to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.518" offset="3677393">We argued too that unlike the Government that if the Court should adopt to use restriction, the result in this case has to be reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.882" offset="3730892">Mr. Beytagh says that that character in Lewis were on the books and the defendant should had noticed of them and I'm going to assume that and even assume that for this purpose, Kahriger and Lewis would notice the excise tax not involved in any case in this Court until Grosso was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.803" offset="3814588">But if Kahriger and Lewis were on the books at the time petitioner failed to pay his tax so to was Irvine.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.401" offset="3841024">And he would've been on notice that if he paid the tax that that evidence could be use against him in a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.025" offset="3875506">Now, the Government says that, if we are wrong in our first view, if you adopt the use restriction, then you recognized that petitioner had a constitutional privilege not to pay the tax but because now, years later, a restriction is put on the use of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.919" offset="3947081">He should have anticipated that in the teeth of Irvine and should've known, "Well, if I pay the tax, the Supreme Court someday will find the use restriction and nothing bad will happen to me".</text>
            <text syncTime="971.237" offset="3988355">I submit that this is entirely unrealistic and to uphold a criminal conviction under a statute that refers to a willful failure in that kind of a circumstance would be pretty noble indeed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1270.896" offset="5186957">There is one other issue in our case that's not Marchetti and I want to be sure that it is not lost cite of and make simply two comments about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.877" offset="5226872">That is the issue of the private communications between the judge and the jury outside of the presence of defendant and his counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.379" offset="5268877">The United States takes the position on its brief that perhaps the rule that we proposed that this is reversible error unless the harmlessness of the communication is made affirmatively to appear would be an appropriate enough rule to adopt in the proper case but they say not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.313" offset="5340662">They say defendant did not object at the right time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.236" offset="5352364">There were things he could've done when he learned about this third hand, 45 minutes after it happened that might have had some curative effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.136" offset="5387891">I think it is significant that with all the legal scholarship that has gone into this case since the time that trial counsel was in the heat of a long trial and hadn't decided what to do or not to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.590" offset="5441703">But the United States has yet to produce or cite any rule of criminal procedure that would have required Mr. McLaughlin to have followed the course of the United States now suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.757" offset="5486425">It has not produced any decision of this Court that says that this is incumbent upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.461" offset="5505233">And at that time, 1963, the law was clearly established in the Third Circuit in which he was practicing by two cases, a recent case of United States v. Neal in 320 F. 2d on an early opinion of Judge Maris in Arrington and Robinson that there is no such obligation on the counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.374" offset="5572838">And I think it would be a little hard to say that these defendants right to be present whenever anything happens in the trial against them was waived because of the failure of his very competent counsel not to take a step that even today no one can find any authority for other than the decision of the court below in this case when it finally got there on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.407" offset="5677014">For these various reasons, may it please the Court, we believe that the conviction should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1408.295" offset="5736573">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.562" offset="5753605">As Professor Wright has pointed out this case involves as far as the Fifth Amendment claim is concerned, failure to pay the 10% excise tax on wagers as distinguished from the $50 special occupational tax that -- and the registration requirement that we're involved in Marchetti, the prior case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.514" offset="5849422">In the main as Professor Wright points out, the position that the Government takes in the two cases is substantially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.528" offset="5897488">I would like to discuss first, this other issue that Professor Wright refers to in passing and then come back to the Fifth Amendment problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.693" offset="5962167">As we understand it, petitioner's contention is that here the trial judge's treatment of a note which he received from the jury was such that it required reversal of his convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.796" offset="6026533">Now as we developed in our brief of last term, and as Professor Wright concedes, no objection was made on this Court until after the jury's verdict was handed down even though counsel was apprised with the fact that there'd been some communication between the jury and the judge and was apprised of this not too long after the matter had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.883" offset="6142934">Now it seems to us that the fact here that the judge plainly stated that the note that he received was one -- it was identical to a later note that is part of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.387" offset="6196955">A later note that was -- that is part of the record was a notification to the judge that the jury was deadlocked and a request for instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.382" offset="6240946">The judge's response was for them to continue to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.530" offset="6269471">He stated when the matter of this first note was brought to his attention, that the first note was substantially the same, that his response had been substantially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.569" offset="6321612">It seems to us that the rule that the petitioner really contends for is that reversal is required whenever there is a communication between the judge and the jury outside of a defendant's presence unless the absence of any prejudice can be conclusively shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.223" offset="6396217">Now, whatever the rule might be as to a situation where the defendant has seasonably obected and this isn't just a procedural requirement if he objects prior to the verdict, a matter can be explored at the time when it makes some difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.101" offset="6451806">But if he waits until after the verdict comes down and then raises the matter, he's effectively preserved his option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.607" offset="6477824">He finds out what the verdict is and then he makes the objection if it goes against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.155" offset="6492035">We don't' think that's required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.243" offset="6504364">It seems to us also that despite all the horribles that are stated in petitioner's brief that the substance of the second note here itself which is part of the record indicates that nothing very untoward could have gone on with respect to the prior communication because the notice is simply a request -- a notification that the jury is deadlocked in a request for instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.249" offset="6612407">We think therefore that the trial judge did not err in his treatment of the note under the circumstances here and that this ground provides no basis for a reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.995" offset="6667368">Now as to the Fifth Amendment claim, at an earlier point in these cases, the argument was developed that Kahriger and Lewis didn't speak to the excise tax problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.260" offset="6720449">And that's true in the sense that Kahriger and Lewis both where cases involving the registration requirement in the special occupational term as distinguished from the excise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.243" offset="6768306">As I pointed out previously, one of the views of Kahriger and Lewis is that -- it was -- they were grounded on the consideration that the registration requirement was only prospective in operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.444" offset="6833194">As Professor Wright directly points out, this argument cannot be made with respect to the excise tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.135" offset="6863914">We point out that we think both Kahriger and Lewis can be read not as standing solely on this perspective retrospective ground but on the question of whether there's any compelled information in the Fifth Amendment sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.648" offset="6941968">I don't want to go back through a familiar ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.194" offset="6952103">We've been through that several times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.901" offset="6959000">But I do point out that with respect to the excise tax return, the non-taxpayer of the excise tax just like the non-registrant for the special occupational tax is free to choose whether he wants to gamble or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.390" offset="7036949">Our position is that Kahriger and Lewis properly understood all that when he decides to gamble, he has made a choice to accept the federal tax conditions that are attached.</text>

            <text syncTime="1793.606" offset="7277798">He knows there's a federal tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.319" offset="7288665">We're not saying that he waves the privilege when he decides to gamble as to the substantive offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2468.799" offset="9978546">And the Court -- Mr. Justice White develops this at length from his concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.990" offset="9999339">The Court was faced with the problem having concluded that the Fifth Amendment applied both to the states and the federal government as to what to do about -- to enter jurisdictional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.004" offset="10059421">Now in Murphy, the Court concluded that this problem could be dealt with by the adoption of an exclusionary rule that would protect against any federal incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.666" offset="10109994">Now, what we suggest here is the Court do the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.752" offset="10126399">Professor Wright says, “No.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.260" offset="10136430">Don't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.387" offset="10140923">Leave it up to Congress if they want to”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.366" offset="10156805">Well, it seems to us that if the question is whether immunity from prosecution completely, total immunity is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.436" offset="10193168">We submit that that's not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.044" offset="10211558">But then maybe that is the situation in which the judgment should be left up to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.884" offset="10234859">But as Professor Wright concedes that's not the requirement under Murphy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.498" offset="10257324">And if it isn't, then we suggest the Court should do the same thing it did in Murphy, adopt the use restriction rule.</text>
