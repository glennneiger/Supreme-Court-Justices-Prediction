            <label>Ms. Blanch Freedman</label>
            <text syncTime="22.531" offset="193494">If it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.431" offset="201122">The petitioner is an alien of Canadian nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.279" offset="216482">He is 33 years old, was duly admitted to the United States for permanent residence in June 1955 when he was 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.792" offset="250546">He has lived in the United States ever since, working -- and working here, always self-supporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.674" offset="274056">By occupation, he is a building maintenance operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.529" offset="293491">He resides in New York City with his mother, who was a naturalized citizen and stepfather, also a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.685" offset="318151">His father is dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.293" offset="324524">And in addition, he has a large family of married brothers and sisters who lived in this country with their respective spouses and children.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.244" offset="360364">Petitioner appeals from an order of deportation that was upheld by the court below that is the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.712" offset="390248">The order is predicated upon the combined operation of two provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.664" offset="422013">Section 241 (a) (1) of the 1952 Act, which renders an alien deportable if at the time of admission he was excludable.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.737" offset="466317">And to Section 212 (a) (4) of the Act which makes excludable an alien who at the time of entry is “afflicted with a psychopathic personality, epilepsy or mental defect.”</text>
            <text syncTime="106.781" offset="530474">Now, the responding charges that the petitioner at the time of entry in 1955 was afflicted with a psychopathic personality namely sexual deviant to which homosexual.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.235" offset="588361">The finding of psychopathic personality rests solely and exclusively upon admissions by petitioner of having engaged in homosexual acts before but principally, after entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.348" offset="648756">The evidence of record is, that prior entry in between the ages of 16 and 21, he had have about three to four experiences a year during which time he also engaged in heterosexual experiences.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.990" offset="711346">After entry and up to the time he was directed to appear before the Immigration Service some nine years later, his homosexual activities averaged about four or three times a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.286" offset="764531">These admissions were made by the petitioner at the Immigration Service upon interrogation by an immigrant inspector in January 1964 and it is in the form of a question and answer statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.952" offset="819179">On this statement of admissions of homosexual activity before but largely after entry, and of no medical evidence of any kind, the United States Public Health Service forthwith certified that at the time of entry, almost ten years prior, petitioner was excludable as an alien afflicted with psychopathic personality namely, homosexual.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.162" offset="923982">At the deportation hearing, petitioner submitted into evidence two medical reports of two imminent psychiatrists, who had examined him personally each a year apart and independently of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.587" offset="985736">The medical evidence of the record establishes that the petitioner is not psychotic; that the petitioner is not afflicted with psychopathic personality.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.589" offset="1025755">There is no counter-medical evidence in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.325" offset="1044668">On the contrary, respondent admits that it has not proved to furnish evidence that petitioner is psychopathic.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.592" offset="1077791">Instead, respondent claims that such medical evidence is not required of it because it construes and applies the language of the statute that is afflicted with psychopathic personality to mean, an alien who indulges in homosexual conduct, even though such conduct is medically unassociated with psychopathic personality or any other medical condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.209" offset="1192208">The respondent claims that its construction of the law is based upon it speedily that that was the intent of the Congress that enacted the 1952 Immigration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.280" offset="1240482">In short, the position of the respondent is that regardless of what the term psychopathic personality may mean to the whole world, to the Congress that enacted it, it was merely a rubric, a rubric by which homosexuals were to be excluded from the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.731" offset="1322297">Now, petitioners submit that it is this interpretation and application of the statute to him that engenders constitutional infirmity.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.202" offset="1364198">As construed and applied, the statute is vague, indefinite and denied petitioner due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.761" offset="1398366">Because one, it contains no boundaries, no standards, no guide for its enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.512" offset="1425429">And two, because it failed to give petitioner adequate notice that his homosexual behavior after entry could be used to establish the alleged excludable condition, psychopathic personality at entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.961" offset="1487182">The constitutional deficiencies that stemmed from respondent's interpretation and administration of the statute led the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in the case of Fleuti against Rosenberg to hold the statute unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.833" offset="1550712">And thereafter that -- that Court affirmed its decision in the very recent case of Lavoie against the Immigration Service that is now pending before this Court on the Government's petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.205" offset="1600240">The facts and issues in the Fleuti, Lavoie and the instant case are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.767" offset="1622392">The major problem that underlies the respondent's construction of the statute is that the actual language of Section 212 (a) (4) is medical terminology and in design and purpose relates to the exclusions of aliens afflicted with a condition that medically can be diagnosed a psychopathic personality whereas homosexuality or homosexual -- or homosexual relates to conduct, to behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.252" offset="1756348">There is no homosexual condition per se, thereof homosexual acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.467" offset="1785292">Of course, a person who engages in homosexual practices may be a psychopathic personality but psychopathology cannot be inferred automatically from homosexual practices.</text>

            <label>Ms. Blanch Freedman</label>
            <text syncTime="523.962" offset="2199176">Then we would have to reach the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.918" offset="2211088">However, sir, as I will come to it, I do not believe that the respondent has interpreted the constitutional history correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.392" offset="2260929">I mean, that that is the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.423" offset="2277021">Now, that -- you cannot deduce from homosexual activity alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.720" offset="2302203">A psychopathic condition or psychopathic personality is not only the opinion of the enumerable side -- authority cited in counsel's brief and in the amicus brief of the homosexual lower form society, which is before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.828" offset="2370644">It is also the opinion of Doctor Paul G. Smith, the Senior Service Surgeon of the United States Public Health Service and Chief in Psychiatry at the Public Health Service Hospital at New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.571" offset="2413693">Now, Dr. Smith testified in the matter of (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="581.433" offset="2429053">He had also testified so -- that is certified the alien in that case to be a psychopathic personality under facts that are similar to his certification of the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.397" offset="2484955">Yet in the (Inaudible) case, he testified that he was in accord with medical opinion that sex deviate is not ipso facto, a psychopathic personality.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.526" offset="2533439">He agreed that to arrive at such a medical finding, there must be something more than sexual deviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.674" offset="2562069">The doctor was then asked how we reconciled his certification of the alien of the psychopathic personality with his professional opinion and to this he replied and I quote, “That as a qualified physician, he was fully in accord with modern psychiatric theory but that as an employee of the United States Public Health Service, he was bound by any instruction of the organization addressed to his employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.347" offset="2668753">Thus, it is evident from knowledgeable sources than in the given situation whether the homosexual conduct denotes an excludable pathologic condition is a matter to be established only by competent examination of the alien by qualified physicians and not merely upon admissions of homosexual practices that have been extracted by an immigrant inspec -- inspector upon interrogation with the view to possible deportation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="671.113" offset="2787871">The administrative interpretation of the statute actually substitutes homosexual behavior for the psychopathic condition stated in the law and it is this very substitution that creates the vagueness in which the law is left without enforcement of the admi -- of the administrato -- of administrative interpretation without guidelines, without boundaries, without tests of any kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="779.542" offset="3221504">Counsel for the Government is not wholly unmindful that there are no boundaries and there are no real test/criteria and so they say in their brief on page 36, “There may indeed be cases where it is difficult to determine whether and in precisely what sense an individual should be deemed homosexual within the intent of the statute”.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.910" offset="3334980">Now, we submit, one may rightfully ask by what standard or test the Government determined that the petitioner in this case should be deemed a homosexual within the intent of the statute as construed by respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.122" offset="3395897">Now, there is no answer disclosed and their brief is significantly silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.790" offset="3418572">Now, assuming as respondent contends and Congress intended to bar homosexuals from to for from immigration, we are still left without an adequate standard or criteria to determine whom the label “homosexual” covers because the term “homosexual” does not described an ascertainable condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.088" offset="3503731">At best it denotes a category and that category is also undefined and lacking insufficient specificity to withstand the constitutional challenge of vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.989" offset="3559320">But this difficulty, this lack of standard does not exist when the statute is enforced as agrees and as we believe Congress mandated.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.812" offset="3594637">Within the homosexual behavior that is reached for exclusion under the law, is that which is medically ascertainable and found to be pathologic, namely, that denotes a psychopathic personality.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.827" offset="3658689">The second aspect of the statute's vagueness that results from respondent's construction and application is that it fails to apprise petitioner of what respondent now claims made him excludable in 1955 and further failed to advice him that post-entry homosexual behavior could be made the basis for his expulsion from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.632" offset="3757850">There is nothing on the face of the statute to indicate to petitioner at entry that psychopathic personality meant homosexual or sex deviant.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.747" offset="3798392">The words homosexual or sex deviant or sexual perversion, do not appear either in the exclusion statute or in the deportation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.376" offset="3836844">Furthermore, there was nothing in the visa application that petitioner was obliged to execute in Montreal, Canada that in anyway gave him any warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.556" offset="3885641">The visa application lists all the excludable classes but it makes no mention homosexual, sex deviants.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.469" offset="3925243">In fact, it does not even list the term psychopathic personality.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.379" offset="3944887">The law may attribute to petitioner knowledge that the statute excluded from admission psych -- first aliens with psychopathic personality.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.686" offset="3994102">But how can he be charged with knowing what is not a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.987" offset="4011342">That indulgence in homosexual practices means that one is so afflicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.847" offset="4034748">To urge now as respondent does that notice and warning can be found in the legislative history and in the particular committee report, I submit, strict as a legal presumption of knowledge beyond legality.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.141" offset="4087933">We submit, where forfeiture of residence is predicated upon conduct held to be proscribed or utilized as the basis of depriving an alien of the right to remain here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1227.530" offset="5013504">The Government established that the hearing through petitioner's own admission under oath that beginning about 1949, six years prior to his entry actually it was only five years prior, and continuing on uninterruptedly to the date of the sworn statement, January 1964, petitioner had regularly engaged on an average of three or four times a year of homosexual behavior.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1351.281" offset="5508472">I know we do have a law of sodomy in New York but the fact that he has never been convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.870" offset="5538879">Dr. Montague Ullman, who was the Director of Psychiatric Services in Minority Hospital in Brooklyn and Professor of Psychiatry at the State University of New York, examined the petitioner in March of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.337" offset="5588720">And in his report, he states and I'm now quoting to what appears in the record on page 15 and 16, “The patient has sexual interest in girls and has had intercourse with them on a number of occasions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.200" offset="5648175">Then skipping in taking the next sentence, “He has abandoned all sexual practices within the past several months because of his annoyance and disgusts with the problems these activities have brought about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.988" offset="5695300">His sexual structure still appears fluid and immature so that he moves from homosexual to heterosexual interest as well as abstinence with almost equal facility.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.179" offset="5740126">As I said before, the span of 14 years of homosexual activity that the respondent talks about, nine-and-a-half years had been post-entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.910" offset="5778996">And as the Court in the Fleuti case recent whether a finding of deportability would have been entered against petitioner in 1965 based on the pre-entry conduct prior to 1955 or even whether on such facts the charge could have -- would have been brought is a matter of high speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.010" offset="5855378">The facts, however, that post-entry behavior is relied upon is some indication that the charge might not have been filed or a finding entered on free entry behavior alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.728" offset="5910235">Respondent proffers to answers to petitioner's charge that he has been deprived of adequate notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.615" offset="5961853">First, respondent says, petitioner is not entitled to fair warning because that doctrine is aimed at regulating conduct, and now I quote from their brief on page 42, “That the fair warning doctrine is not a device to enable an individual afflicted with a condition that if discovered would have barred his admission to this country and to so conducthimself as to avoid this condition becoming known to administrative authorities”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.596" offset="6089749">And that, we submit, completely reveals the failure or the emptiness of the Government's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.036" offset="6119528">Surely, the respondent in this case cannot have it both ways because it is precisely that there was a lack of proof of condition -- of conditions, psychopathic personality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.255" offset="6164355">Either before or after entry that this petitioner has been urging throughout and it is the respondent who has been insisting that it is not concerned about petitioner's condition, it knows how he is behaved and that that is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.891" offset="6230915">The point is that, where petitioner's condition is involved here it could not be hidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.601" offset="6253798">But if behavior is involved, then it could have been controlled by him that in fact he does not suffer from any condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.209" offset="6288175">Had respondent applied the statute to petitioner as it reads and as we contend it should be, namely, whether petitioner was afflicted with psychopathic personality that would be addressed to condition?</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.286" offset="6340524">But as to condition, respondent has offered no proof and so admits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.726" offset="6366229">But the fact is that, respondent has administered the statute as applying to petitioner's condition to beha -- the petitioner's behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.409" offset="6401024">And thus, the failure of the statute as construed and applied denied him the opportunity of knowingly refraining from engaging in certain conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.980" offset="6447313">This is not to hide a condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.060" offset="6459643">Petitioner has concealed nothing because he has no condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.889" offset="6474898">This is really to regulate behavior if the impact of the statute demanded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.468" offset="6497259">Respondent's other answer to the issue of fair warning is that since Congress could retroactively make homosexual conduct a ground for deportation, it could also make future homosexual conduct in this country by an alien, a cause for his deportation whether or not its intentions were expressed clearly though Congress may but the fact is that Congress hasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.354" offset="6608750">It has not made post-entry sexual deviation of ground for deportation, at least not at the time that this case -- that the matter pertain to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.505" offset="6653367">This Court has repeatedly held that deportation may be had only for grounds specifically expressed in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.930" offset="6687117">The Immigration Amendment of 1965 added to the exclusion statute the phrase “sexual deviation”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.530" offset="6721494">It added nothing to the deportation section if the effect of the Government's order is to deport petitioner for something which the statute gave him no notice at the time of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.226" offset="6780322">Respondent's obvious that the use of legislative history is permissible to clarify statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.083" offset="6807698">And thus, with the aid of relevant legislative history, the term psychopathic personality is embracing homosexual conduct becomes clear and definite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.723" offset="6846255">Now, resort to legislative history is meaningful and at times necessary but only when the statute on its face is not sufficiently clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.510" offset="6881364">The term psychopathic personality, however, is not ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.896" offset="6898918">It is not -- it is known and established medical nomenclature denoting a medical condition and it is fully defined in medical literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.473" offset="6945311">When courts have looked to legislative history, it has been to clarify statutory construction, not to rewrite the statute and create new and different provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.002" offset="6983346">For example, in the very recent case of the Immigration and Naturalization against -- Service against Errico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.176" offset="7008110">The Court, in the current term, examined the legislative history at Section 241 of the Immigration -- 241 (f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.166" offset="7060041">That section bars the deportation of an alien who gain permanent admission to the United States to the perpetuation of a fraud provided the alien is an immediate relative of a United State citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.652" offset="7117928">Now, the Court reviewed legislative history, not to make the term “fraud” means something that intrinsically is not fraudulent, but to determine whether the proved acts of fraud in that case were the kind that were contemplated and wherein the word -- within the intent of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.830" offset="7206640">In the case at bar, the respondent resorts to legislative history, not to determine whether a proved medical condition of psychopathic personality was intended to be included under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.018" offset="7259408">On the contrary, legislative intent is being used here by the respondent to escape proving its burden that the homosexual acts by the petitioner constituted a psychopathic personality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.010" offset="7327431">And it is this rewriting of the history that makes this constitu -- this statute as interpreted by Congress unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="1827.270" offset="7412485">We believe that two questions are presented for decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.359" offset="7428786">The first is whether by providing in Section 212 (a) (4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 for the exclusion from the United States of aliens who are “afflicted with psychopathic personality”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.111" offset="7491793">Congress intended to encompass within those terms an individual-like petitioner, who had engaged between the ages of 16 and 21 in homosexual relations on an average of three or four times a year and who was found by a Public Health Service physicians and psychiatrists to be a “sexual deviate” at the time of his entry into the United States in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.085" offset="7591685">The second question is whether if Congress did so intend, its use of the words “afflicted with psychopathic personality” rather than more specific words directed to homosexual propensities or other deviations from normal sexual practice, make it constitutionally impermissible to apply that statute to the facts of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1908.992" offset="7739329">Well, to that extend, Mr. Justice Stewart, we think that that's really something that prevailed petitioner's basic argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.996" offset="7771408">We think that his dispute is really with Congress and not -- and not with the courts as it were because the legislative history, we submit, is entirely clear that no matter what psychiatrists or the way to view among psychiatrists may be today as to whether homosexuality is a condition or can merely be used as an adjective to describe a practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.202" offset="7860224">The legislative history, we think is entirely clear that Congress did consider the condition and that Congress intended to encompass that condition within the words it used in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.031" offset="7899512">So that if in fact petitioner is contending that Congress mislabeled whatever it was trying or whomever it was trying to exclude, that's because -- that would be true no matter what the statute said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.348" offset="7960743">In other words, if Congress had retained its original proposed language in the statute and excluded specifically homosexuals or sex perverts, we assume petitioner would still be here saying that that's an inaccurate description of whatever it is that -- that he is afflicted with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.608" offset="8029811">But we just think that that's exactly what Congress sits for, to determine disputes among psychiatrists and among experts in this kind of an area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.911" offset="8067009">And that if there are disputes among the psychiatrists as to what proper way of labeling somebody who regularly engaged in homosexual activity is?</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.391" offset="8100968">Congress decided on the basis of recommendations by the Public Health Service that it was a condition, a pathological condition, and that it want to exclude the people who had that conditions from the United States as immigrants.</text>

            <text syncTime="2597.000" offset="10491382">All that we argue is that Congress made it clear that that to the extent that that word does have meaning, it wished to have aliens who were -- who didn't meet that condition excluded from entry into the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2638.880" offset="10658879">We submit that there's no constitutional defect to this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.992" offset="10675388">First, because warning in the sense that it's usually thought of in the constitutional sense which is necessary for criminal and certain kinds of civil statute is irrelevant to the kind of determination that has to be made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.740" offset="10730350">And second, because we think that the legislative histories provide sufficient content to the word “psychopathic personality”, to ensure a fair and even-handed administration by those who were responsible for administering the act and by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.594" offset="10793775">I say warning is irrelevant because the statute does not on its face or in the manner of its administration purport to regulate how an alien is to act after he enters the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.587" offset="10837765">All that it does is that it excludes aliens, who fit certain statutory descriptions at the time that they seek to enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.053" offset="10867545">The question before the immigration officer and the Boards of Appeal and the courts was whether petitioner was “homosexual” at the time he entered the United States in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.632" offset="10913938">Now with all the warning in the world, assuming that that statute have been as clear as it could have been, petitioner could not have changed that statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3562.737" offset="14354369">If I might just return for a minute to the -- again to the question of fair warning and I say this Court has said as recently in the 1956 term in the Lehman and Carson case and Mulcahey and Catalanotte in 353 U.S. with only two dissents that Congress may legislate retrospectively with regards to deportation of aliens who are in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.239" offset="14440364">In other words, an alien in the United States who enters has in effect a revocable license here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3596.670" offset="14490102">Let's see, is this an argument that in any event under the 65 statute, he should be deported?</text>

            <text syncTime="3601.827" offset="14510686">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.987" offset="14511313">We don't read that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.200" offset="14516224">We don't read the 65 statute as being retrospective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.514" offset="14525419">But we're just saying, this is an answer to the argument which petitioner makes and which Mr. Justice Fortas raised, which is, that this man relied on the absence of any clear exclusionary provision in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.977" offset="14579231">We think he has no constitutional right to rely on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.087" offset="14591770">That if he entered the United States and did not know of this but later it was point out to him that by reason of the legislative history and the construction and application of the statute homosexuality was a ground for excludability, then, he could be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.618" offset="14665853">Although, he thought at the time he entered and at the time he committed his homosexual acts even in the United States that it was not a ground for deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.725" offset="14698245">Indeed in those cases, in Galvan and Press and Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, the Court sustained the deportation of aliens who had no reason to believe that they would be deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.461" offset="14741191">Either at the time they entered the United States or at the time they committed acts, which under a subsequent statute became the basis for their deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.294" offset="14772537">And we think that applies in these circumstances as well.</text>
