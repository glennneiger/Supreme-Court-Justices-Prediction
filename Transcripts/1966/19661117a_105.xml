            <label>Mr. Richard Lipsitz</label>
            <text syncTime="39.784" offset="262457">May it please the Court, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.823" offset="274683">This case has come before the Court as a result of a complaint filed on behalf of the class of persons known as the Faculty of the State University of New York at the University of Buffalo, Buffalo, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.171" offset="340093">A complaint was filed following the requirement imposed upon the members of the faculty of that institution when that institution became a state institution in 1962 and previously having done a private plea owned, operated, maintained university at Buffalo, New York known as the University of Buffalo.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.830" offset="458689">When it became a state institution in 1962, the officials of the State University of New York of which this was then a part applied for the first time to these particular faculty persons and others the requirements of what are known as the Feinberg Law of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.838" offset="558686">The Feinberg Law of the State of New York is the subject of course of the Adler decision previously decided by this Court in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.271" offset="604453">In our complaint, we attack again as was have done in the Adler case but in a much more comprehensive way and in a much broader scope as I might say, the entire complex of statutes administrative regulations procedures and certificates that have become known as the administration and application of Feinberg Law and more specifically we attack in our complaint Section 3021 and 3022 of the New York Education Law, Section 105 of the New York Civil Service Law, Article 18, Section 244 of the Rules of the Regents of the University of the State of New York, the current body over the trustees, the latter whom administered trustee institutions of higher learning, the former of whom the Board of Regents are responsible for the entire state education system.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.029" offset="843525">And also we attack in our complaint the procedures implied -- applied rather by the various defendants to implement the complex statutes known as the Feinberg Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.755" offset="890441">The facts of the case are as follows and they have to be, I suppose, discussed on two different levels, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.578" offset="925654">The first level on which they should be discussed is what happened with the statute following the decision of this Court in the Adler case and in that respect, the facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.711" offset="986258">As of the time of the decision of the Adler case, the Section 3022, the heart of the Feinberg Law as such was not applicable by its very terms to any employees whether they'd be faculty or other kinds of personnel to institutions of higher education.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.514" offset="1089390">The statute was applicable solely and wholly to institutions known as public schools which in New York State and elsewhere in United States are those considered to be elementary and high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.118" offset="1143829">In 1953 after the Adler decision, the New York State legislature added these words to Section 3022 of the New York Education Law and I quote, “In all other personnel and employees of any college or other institution of higher education owned and operated by the state or any subdivision thereof,” thus, making the statute, for the first time, applicable to university, college and college faculty, professors and other personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.954" offset="1267231">Furthermore, this was --</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="292.746" offset="1274337">Does that make the issue here different than it was in Adler?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_lipsitz" startTime="295.351" stopTime="310.495">
            <label>Mr. Richard Lipsitz</label>
            <text syncTime="295.351" offset="1284786">We say that it makes a different issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.339" offset="1292727">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.199" offset="1300146">Of course, I think it should be stated at the outset if I haven't made it plain and we are also attacking the entire statutory arrangements even as it was previously before this change in 1953.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="310.495" stopTime="319.751">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="310.495" offset="1345390">Yes, but I gather this what you've just said would be the predicate of an argument which you don't have to overrule Adler defined for you as to college --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_lipsitz" startTime="319.751" stopTime="597.103">
            <label>Mr. Richard Lipsitz</label>
            <text syncTime="319.751" offset="1382379">That is -- that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.879" offset="1386872">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.009" offset="1399411">The other changes occurred of which much was made by the decision of the court below, the three men court which heard this case about which we will see more later was that Section 12-a of the New York Civil Service Law that being the statute at the time of the Adler case was in 1958 changed to Section 105 of the New York State Civil Service Law and prior to the time of its change to becoming Section 105, it added a new provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.685" offset="1566072">That new provision is the second paragraph of 105(c) which may be found, if Your Honors care to look at it, at page 113 of our brief and also of course in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.243" offset="1628348">And that Section added these words, “For the purposes of this section, members of the Communist Party of the United States of America or the Communist Party of the State New York shall constitute a prima facie” -- two words prima facie having been emphasized, “evidence of disqualification for appointment to a retention of any officer position in the service of the state or of any city or civil division thereof.”</text>
            <text syncTime="408.561" offset="1737644">That section -- that provision rather was not in the then Section 12-a of the Civil Service when the Adler case was before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.649" offset="1769932">It was added to 12-a subsequent to Adler and then was converted in the Section 105 of the Civil Service Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.673" offset="1806085">At the time it became 105 of the New York State Civil Service Law, there was also added subdivision 3 to formerly 12-a and now 105 and subdivision 3 is found at page 114 of our brief and also of course in the record and rather than quoting it from you, I will tell you that it adds to 105, a provision which -- but for one sentence is almost identical with the provisions of Section 3021 of the New York Education Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.106" offset="1943803">The one sentence which is added as a reference to a definition of what is meant by any treasonable or seditious act or acts to the New York Penal Law, Sections 160 and 161 but which will not expressly refer to are the sections of the New York Penal Law where the definitions of these terms could be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.152" offset="2031992">We are not here attacking as such the constitutionality of Section 160 and 161 of the New York Penal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.612" offset="2061772">We, however, in our argument will suggest and indeed point out that if the interpretation of this subdivision 3 of Section 105 is dependent upon an interpretation by somebody of this Court or otherwise of 160 and 161 of the Penal Law that Section -- subdivision 3 is of course unconstitutional for being indefinite and a restriction on First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.335" offset="2184756">Now those, Your Honors, are the statutory changes in which I referred to as the level of facts that can be best described in this fashion that have occurred since the Adler case.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.750" offset="2234389">I would like to stress one thing which I think -- we do think deserves some mentioned and that is this, that when those words were added to Section 3022, that is to say their application to any personnel or employees of any college or rather institution of higher education, there was no claim by the New York state legislature that there was any present prospective future, potential or otherwise any kind of danger, imminent or about to occur to those institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.386" offset="2372942">They didn't even refer to the fact that they have made findings in 1949 relating to the alleged fear, danger and imminence of so called infiltrations of the public schools system by the persons who would be following some subversive course of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.718" offset="2454235">They not only didn't refer to it, they didn't rely upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.951" offset="2463222">They just put it in the statute without any legislative reliance, finding or investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="602.018" offset="2511496">But as a matter of determining whether or not as we would argue, there is some basis for the state acting in this field that is to say in the field of First Amendment rights, we say that it indicates a lack of any compelling need to allow at the kind of invasion of First Amendment rights which the Court has from time to time allowed because of a demonstration of need but we don't claim that there is any constitutional requirement that a state legislature make a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.745" offset="2634376">We say that however that it does have an impact upon whether or not there was any basis for allowing and there is any basis at the present time for allowing an invasion of First Amendment rights of persons who happened to be university and college or teachers and other faculty.</text>

            <text syncTime="667.614" offset="2773870">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.851" offset="2774810">Well, we don't make any claim in our brief as such although other briefs do that there is a less susceptibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.936" offset="2803127">There is no -- I will argue with you and to you that there is less susceptibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.306" offset="2828622">What I'm saying is that there is no demonstration that there is anybody employed or about to be employed in the state university system from which this alleged danger would have occur that was found to be a fact in regard to the public school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.005" offset="2891421">It's not a question of whether there is a bigger or less susceptibility on the part of students although that is an issue that can be argued in terms of academic freedom that persons as they grow older become more mature and should be able to accept different points of view much more readily than innocent in younger school children.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.448" offset="2953174">Now, the facts that occurred in regard to the particular plaintiffs are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.346" offset="2984730">Each of these particular plaintiffs had been employed by the then University of Buffalo in one capacity or another at a time when it was the University of Buffalo and private institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.227" offset="3028302">There were of course was no requirement that they subscribe to anything, signed anything or otherwise provide any information except as to their professional competence or fitness to become employed at the time of hiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.045" offset="3095594">One of them, plaintiff Starbuck who is treated somewhat differently by the state and therefore has had a different history in respect to what's happened to him was employed as a librarian.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.481" offset="3149302">It is claimed by the state and was so found by the court below that his employment was not an academic employment and that therefore his employment was not subject to Section 3021 or 3022 of the Education Law but rather he was in the case of any other civil servant of the State of New York under the provisions of the Civil Service Law to be qualified or disqualified from employment by virtue of the provisions of Section 105 on New York State Civil Service Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.661" offset="3274062">He was asked after having been employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.340" offset="3292766">In other words, excuse me, after he became employed, I must show the correction.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.112" offset="3327770">He was the one person employed while this institution was a public university.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.144" offset="3351907">He became employed after the merger, the only one of the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.535" offset="3365491">And when he was employed, he was employed without any requirement that he signed anything or answer anything but along after several months of employment, he was asked the question that appears at page 65 of our brief and otherwise in the record in which the question based strictly upon the statutory provisions found in Section 105 and that question was, “Have you ever advised or taught or were you ever a member of any society of group of person who taught or advocated the doctrine of the Government of United States or of any political subdivision there shall be -- should be overthrown or overthrown by forced violence or any other unlawful means?”</text>
            <text syncTime="855.292" offset="3524524">He declined and refused to answer that question whereupon his employment was threatened to be terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.641" offset="3545945">He in fact brought a lawsuit of his own that is as the sole plaintiff in Federal District Court to seek in juncture relief against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.278" offset="3572485">That lawsuit was thereafter abandoned in favor of his becoming and joining as a plaintiff and this lawsuit which is before the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1495.158" offset="6084002">Now, we claim in our briefs and we argue before the Court that these statutes certainly should be declared to be unconstitutional as an infringement upon First Amendment rights as a bill of attainder and for lacking of due process in regard to all persons affected by these statutes including the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.816" offset="6218585">We particularly argue in this case of course the current constitution in respect to institutions of higher learning or reasons that there has been no demonstration of any need of going or otherwise to invade First Amendment rights and that there is an expression joined quite imminently by this Court in a number of cases since Adler that academic freedom has a right to cherish and to be fully protected under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.312" offset="6344600">As -- on this -- on the question of whether or not the First Amendment rights of these plaintiffs are violated, we of course, rely upon all of the cases on this subject which had been decided since Adler and which without suggesting to Your Honors although the question was asked that it is necessary to overrule Adler nevertheless indicate that this Court has departed in some substantial measure from the standards of Adler and I don't need only to refer to the acknowledgment of the minority of this Court itself in the Elfbrandt decision were it states and at one portion of the Elfbrandt decision that though the majority did not purport to overrule or delimit Adler, at the end of the decision nevertheless the minority decision in effect says but that's about what they did by virtue of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.008" offset="6567372">Now, in what fashion has this Court departed from what appears to have been what was the law at the time of the Adler decision?</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.830" offset="6618676">The answer is this, we think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.893" offset="6626931">Firstly, Adler states and it states as plainly as can be that there is no right to public employment, that if the person doesn't like what he's required to submit to as an employer of the state, he has a perfectly free choice to go elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.145" offset="6691924">This Court and I need not to spend the time going into the decisions that have been written on the subject as quite candidly and expressly stated in subsequent decisions that unconditional, that unconstitutional conditions may not be imposed upon public employment anymore than it can be on any other public right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.955" offset="6775202">In the doctrine that if you don't like what you have to do in order to become employed by the state, you can go elsewhere is no longer we think the law as expressed in a number of cases decided subsequent to Adler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.438" offset="6821073">One of which of course Elfbrandt and other which is the case decided from Oregon on the same subject the Baggett and Bullitt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.552" offset="6869556">In addition to which in other areas, it has been quite clear that the Court has apparently taken this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.473" offset="6901217">But more importantly than that and we have attempted to analyze the complex questions that are presented by the Section 105 requirements and we do that starting at page 35 through 37 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.879" offset="6990869">The requirements imposed by Section 105 in New York State Civil Service law just as much now as I work for the time of Adler though not brief nor argued before this Court as our research indicates when Adler was argued, the requirements of 105 are so vague, are so contradictory and indeed are so overreaching in our view that they cannot add by themselves constitutionally be sustained for instance and I won't go into all of the various considerations that are present in Section 105 but it appears that merely embracing the doctrine, the Marx's if you will, the government should be overthrown by force or violence is a ground for disqualifying a person from public employment not by doing of an act but the embracing of a doctrine and this is as clear as clear can be from the provisions of Section 105 if one carefully reads and analyzes them an I refer to the provisions of Section subdivision 1(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.845" offset="7270797">Section 1(b) of -- subdivision 1(b) of the Civil Service Law Section 105 also makes it unlawful to print, publish, edit, issue or sell any book in which the doctrine is contained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.151" offset="7315937">Well, at the same time advocating or embracing that is to say having the belief of the duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.499" offset="7341328">Now, we say for a variety of reasons the whole section is unable to be sustained constitutionally based upon present standards of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.001" offset="7379362">I would turn now to the argument that we think is a key to the decision of which -- when it is made in this case and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.701" offset="7418128">The state has taken the position very proudly that unlike other loyalty complexes from other states, New York State has provided the optimum of due process because all that New York State says is that the person who has been or is a member of the subversive organization, in this case the Communist Party, is only prima facie disqualified from either becoming employed or retaining employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.113" offset="7527842">And by virtue of those two words Your Honors, the state claims that there's nothing wrong with the entire system provided for under Section 3022.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.958" offset="7567235">We claim that this doctrine in a sense imposes an impossible burden upon the persons involved who if some of them were to concede or admit that they are members of the Communist Party could over -- only overcome this burden in the words of the United States -- of the New York State Court of Appeals and one of the three cases which became known as Adler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.611" offset="7657827">They can only overcome it in the following fashion, (a) by proving that the organization is not subversive an impossible burden in any hearing because they don't have acknowledgment against the forces of the state which has already proved this to its own satisfaction, the ability of the individual to prove that it is not subversive as an impossible burden or (b) denying membership or (c) denying knowledge of the aims and goals of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.665" offset="7766079">According to the Lederman decision, one of the three cases involved in Adler, these are the three things that are necessary to overcome the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.461" offset="7793246">There is absolutely had been no consideration given to the facts as evidence by the Elfbrandt decision, the Aptheker decision, the Scales decision the Noto decision of this Court that innocent knowing membership cannot be and should not be the grounds for disqualifying anything neither employment as a teacher Elfbrandt nor ability to obtain a passport, Aptheker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.002" offset="7891362">The State of New York has said in its right in the decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1962.501" offset="7953324">It must take activity in pursuance of the unlawful aims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.015" offset="7967431">The State of New York doesn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.753" offset="7974431">It says that you -- to overcome this presumption, you have to prove that the organization wasn't subversive that you were a member of it but that you didn't know its aims and to neglects completely to consider what is now the law as we see it in terms of the rights that have been created by these other decisions that innocent knowing membership cannot be the grounds for disqualification which is the Elfbrandt decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.042" offset="8059591">Now, we say that the so called doctrine of rational connection in this field which has been used to justify the upholding of prima facie presumptions if you will and shifting the burdens to the person seeking employment as a doctrine which not only should not be applied to the field where the First Amendment rights of speech or association that are involved but indeed there is no rational connection between what has being done by the state here and what we claim as the fact by virtue of the fact that the state has never demonstrated that anything involving membership in any organization is the equivalent of disqualifying or should be the equivalent of disqualifying a person from teaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.144" offset="8255927">Furthermore, it is our claim, as I mentioned at the outset that the -- under the Brown decision, the effect of the state legislature in 1958 now said that members of the Communist Party are ineligible to all office in the state constitutes a bill of attainder and as such it is constitutionally defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.369" offset="8344848">While it is true that the Court in Adler upheld the proposition that an administrative agency could make a finding, it did it at a time before it was determined how it was going to be done and what manner of means are going to be used as Justice Frankfurter stated in his dissent before the statute had anything but its bare bones on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.882" offset="8422902">But in any event when the legislature in 1958 said legislatively no person who is a member of the Communist Party shall be eligible or that is to say membership shall be prima facie evidence of ineligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.094" offset="8475773">The legislature said as did the Congress in Brown against the United States that this means a person is ineligible to be employed in the state university.</text>

            <text syncTime="2117.333" offset="8572740">I represent the Attorney General of the State of New York appearing in support of the constitutionality of the statutes which are here challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.495" offset="8609311">Mr. Crary, the state university counsel will argue the case on behalf of the state university and the procedures adopted by it to implement these statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.801" offset="8654555">It is the position of the state in this case that the constitutionality of these statutes, the Feinberg Law that is Education Law Section 3022 has been upheld by this Court in the Adler case and that there have been no changes in the law since that case which would warrant a different decision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.351" offset="8756746">The Feinberg Law was first enacted in 1949 to eliminate from the states public school system as teachers, persons willfully and deliberately advocating the overthrow of the government by force or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.150" offset="8831979">Such persons were already ineligible for service in the public -- in the state employment but the Feinberg Law was intended to implement the disqualification under Civil Service Section 12-a which had been on the book since 1939 by providing procedures whereby the public school teachers and the Board of Regents would implement Section 12-a of the Civil Service Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.756" offset="8954441">The only change in the Feinberg Law since 1949 and since the Adler case has been the fact that now instead of just public school teachers being covered employees of the state university institutions of higher education of the state had been covered in and a requirement has been added that the Board of Regents report annually to the legislature in the effectiveness of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.808" offset="9086621">Civil Service Law Section 12-a has been amended once since the Adler case, that was in 1958 when they added to Section 12-a, a provision that membership in the Communist Party would be prima facie evidence of disqualification for state service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.851" offset="9178781">The only other change in Section 12-a is that in a general recodification of the Civil Service Law in 1958, Section 12-a of the Civil Service Law was renumbered as subdivisions 1 and 2 of Section 105 of that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.950" offset="9263208">Appellants in an attempt to avoid the ruling in the Adler case seek to make this case a challenge to the constitutionality of every statute ever enacted in the State of New York having to do with subversive activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.792" offset="9326529">For example, they challenge the language of Section 160 and 161 of the Penal Law relating to criminal anarchy but this is not a prosecution for criminal anarchy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.058" offset="9379610">What's more, those sections have been repealed by a general revision of the New York State Penal Law and effective in 1967 they will no longer be the law of New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.814" offset="9430601">Appellants also challenged the language of Civil Service Law Section 105 subdivision 3 relating to removal from public office for sedition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.034" offset="9479502">But this is not a charge of sedition and these persons have not been charged with treasonable or seditious acts or words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.663" offset="9526000">Section -- Subdivision 3 of Section 105 was formally subdivision, was formally Section 23-a of the Civil Service Law has been on the books a long time was on the books when the Adler case was decided and is not new to the law of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.551" offset="9597576">The Feinberg Law and the rules of the Board of Regents however continue to refer only to Civil Service Section 12-a or subdivisions 1 and 2 of Civil Service Law Section 105.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.689" offset="9658180">These relate only to the disqualification of persons for service in the state service for advocating deliberately and willfully the overthrow of the government by force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.363" offset="9720874">We are concerned here only with the hiring of personnel of the State University of New York and whether they are qualified or not and we contend that subdivisions 1 and 2 of that section are the only ones with which we are here concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.931" offset="9787120">Thus, our inquiry is only whether a state statute may disqualify a person for employment in a state college if he deliberately and willfully advocates the overthrow of our government by force and violence which is all that the Feinberg Law in Section 12-a do as far as these persons are concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="2463.845" offset="9958797">On page 16 of my brief in a footnote, you will see a reference to the fact that these -- there has been a general revision of the Penal Law of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.405" offset="10008952">Sections 160 and 161 have been repealed effective in 1967 and there will be a new provision relating to criminal anarchy with an entirely different definition as of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.308" offset="10060570">The definition is in the footnote on the bottom of page 16 of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.253" offset="10084394">For this reason, I feel that in interpreting, I don't feel that subdivision 3 of Section 105 of the Civil Service Law is pertinent but certainly even if it is pertinent, it seems to me since it relates to the removal of the persons for sedition, it would be something which this Court would abstain from deciding under the course of New York have interpreted these new Sections and it would certainly seem premature here where no such question is involved in the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.477" offset="10233292">As I say -- said, all we are concern with is an inquiry as to whether a state statute may disqualify a person for employment if he deliberately and willfully advocates the overthrow of the government by force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.819" offset="10306644">This is exactly the same question which was decided in the Adler case where this Court held that a person may be denied the privilege of working for the school system of the state of New York if he advocates unlawful overthrow of the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3092.477" offset="12473240">It is a corporation which has existed since 1784 which is the head of New York Education Department under the New York constitution and which in that capacity have supervisory and regulatory authority overall education public, private, elementary, secondary and higher in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.540" offset="12565504">The State University of New York on the other hand is a corporation created in the education department.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.097" offset="12591731">A public corporation in the year 1948 for the purpose of administering state operated and supported higher education in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.360" offset="12636766">It is the Board of Trustees of that corporation which I represent and which administered these statutes in the manner which had brought this case to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.664" offset="12694026">The -- I also represent administrative officers of the university including its new president, Samuel B. Gould who took off as of 1964 after this case had risen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.610" offset="12749824">I apologize for my cold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.312" offset="12768632">My concern is to -- we rely upon the Attorney General's position, who has the duty of defending the validity of New York statutes and we rely upon and support the position which the Attorney General has taken in this case in support of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.640" offset="12841984">My concern here is to attempt to demonstrate to the Court that the university in carrying out the duties which became imposed upon it by virtue of those statutes has carried them out in accordance with their valid purpose and without imposing, super imposing upon them any requirements which in and of themselves could be construed as being beyond the needs of the statutes or in any way unreasonable or violated of personal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.688" offset="12978134">In 1953 after this Court's decision in Adler, the Board of Regents proceeded as the statute required it to do to hold hearings upon others and to make listings of those organizations which you'd found to be subversive within the meaning of the New York statute then 12-a of the Civil Service Law now Section 105 because the only thing which the Feinberg Law did was to implement that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.380" offset="13116897">The Feinberg Law itself did not make any definition of subversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.091" offset="13143751">It merely provided a procedure for implementing that disqualification for employment by the State of New York which had long been contained of Section 12-a of the Civil Service Law and it did interest this Court knows from its consideration in the Adler case by providing or upon notice in hearing listing of organizations found to support those illegal objectives of force to overthrow the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.935" offset="13271124">After the hearing, the listing -- the organizations listed were two, the Communist Party of the State of New York and the Communist Party of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.170" offset="13312084">The regents duly listed them, promulgated them, put it in their circular in which the Feinberg Law was explained to the schools to which it applied and thereafter the presumption which Adler had said was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.292" offset="13384495">It was proper to infer the fact from the facts found, the ultimate fact from the facts found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.944" offset="13407169">Thereafter there was a presumption under the New York statute that those organizations -- that member -- knowing membership in those organizations disqualified – this knowing membership disqualified for employment in the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.758" offset="13498389">Now in as much to answer one of Your Honors question, in as much as all the Feinberg Law does is implement the Civil Service Law and the Civil Service Law itself requires knowing advocacy by the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.078" offset="13575711">My own feeling and I think the university's construction of the statute has not been that mere membership susceptible of being innocent is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.549" offset="13625553">It must be a membership which presumptively supports the objective, the illegal objectives of the party but in which the member individually shares because that's what the Civil Service Law dis -- that's the disqualification of the Civil Service Law individual advocacy of the violence or otherwise unlawful overthrow of government.</text>
