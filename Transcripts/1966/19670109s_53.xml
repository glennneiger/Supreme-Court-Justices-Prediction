            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">I am authorized to announce the opinion and judgment of The Court in number 53, National Labor Relations Board petitioner and C &amp; C Plywood Corp. the case which we brought here on certiorari the United States Court of Appeals to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.025" offset="80039">The respondent employer the Plywood Corp. was brought before the National Labor Relations Board to answer a complaint that if inauguration of a premium pay plan during the term of a collective bargaining agreement without prior consultation with the Union representing its employees violated the duties imposed by Section 8(a)(5) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.670" offset="190589">The Board issued a cease-and-desist order and rejected the claim and respondent's action was authorized by the collective agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.722" offset="222877">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit refused however to enforce the Board's order, The Court reasoned that a provision and the agreement, a collective bargaining agreement between the Union and the employer which arguably allow the employer to institute the premium pay plan absolutely divested the Board of Jurisdiction to entertain the Union's unfair labor practice charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.470" offset="333845">We granted certiorari to consider what seems to us a substantial question of federal labor law.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.086" offset="360281">So the reason said out in some detail and a written opinion which has been filed with a clerk, we reverse the judgment and remand the case for the Court of Appeals for enforcement of the Board's order.</text>
