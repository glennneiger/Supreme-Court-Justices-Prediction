            <text syncTime="49.728" offset="198844">It is the contention of the appellant, Mr. James Sailors and others individual plaintiffs of this case that the constitutional principle of Reynolds versus Sims companion cases related thereto extends to the county level of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.570" offset="314201">And on that basis and consistent with those decisions any logic and in some policy that the Equal Protection Clause extends no less to the local level than it does to the state level.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.409" offset="409600">The facts involved in this matter as far as James Sailors and his people related individual plaintiffs are concerned or spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.618" offset="478459">Under the 1960 Census, Kent County, the second largest populous county in the State of Michigan, in Western Michigan had a population of some 363,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.044" offset="556095">The City of Grand Rapids which also comprises the Grand Rapids School District has a population of 201,000 of those 363,000 or some 55%, that after World War II as in all communities, large communities, the flight to suburbia the core cities became surrounded with the young afluent populations who generally and before that time had been living in the city to help solve the city's problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.650" offset="774583">And the city itself became the receptacle for large numbers of poor culturally deprived people.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.001" offset="827977">It is the contention of the plaintiff that in order to preserve its tax base, the plaintiff as a citizen of the school district, the City of Grand Rapids, and others within that school district made various annexations surrounding and this is rised to the particular controversy involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.743" offset="974890">Now, there's a peculiar system set up as an extension of state government into the county level.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.146" offset="1020552">Part of county Government is taken cared of by a Board of Supervisors that handles the ditches, the roads, and matters of that type.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.025" offset="1072065">And another part of state government delegated to the county level provides for a county board of education.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.226" offset="1112816">Now, this is an all powerful important body.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.797" offset="1143118">In the City of Michigan under the appropriate acts, this board is composed of five people, the county board in each of the counties of the state, five members and each two years biannually.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.318" offset="1229218">Notice goes out to each of the school districts in the county, the individual school districts in the county of which at the time of the origin of this case there was some 40 to 50 to come at a common place and each representative of each of these school districts may then cast its ballot, its ballot for a member or two members for the exception of the third time around of the county board.</text>

            <label>Mr. Wendell A. Miles</label>
            <text syncTime="407.692" offset="1630668">For instance as a resident of the City of Grand Rapids with some 201,000 other people, I am allowed to vote for the nine members of my school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.854" offset="1699318">And that 201,000 people school district representing 55% of the population of the whole county is allowed one vote as it casts its vote for a member of the county board.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.599" offset="1786358">If I was a member of an area known as Nelson Center, I would be coming from an area of 100 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.322" offset="1837244">I would be casting my vote for the school board which reflects my view, my thought at the next county school board election.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.853" offset="1887399">And as a person from Nelson Center, my vote is cast for a member of the county school board equally to and alongside of that member of the City of Grand Rapids School District that has 201,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.122" offset="1964408">Thus we have asserted that the ratio of imbalance and the county school board for the County of Kent now known as the intermediate school board was at the time of the election of the people that took action on this case some 2000 to one between the Grand Rapids School District and Nelson Center.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.708" offset="2082795">That has now been corrected all the way to 900 to 1 as we understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.632" offset="2102439">You say that it still a hopeless imbalance.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.463" offset="2121770">Now, the State of Michigan has delegated educational functions on the county level, and these are extremely important to every person in the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.947" offset="2183732">The county board is stripped down of all of its labels is a legislative body.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.961" offset="2215811">It sets policy for the entire county.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.578" offset="2234305">It has the power to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.435" offset="2245695">It has the power to levy taxes on everybody of the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.880" offset="2267429">And at the time of the creation or voting for the constituent board that existed at the time of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.596" offset="2298358">In this case, 2% of the people in Kent County could control the county board which would determine what taxes would be laid upon all of the people of the county for various functions special education, bonding.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.994" offset="2399922">Furthermore, the county board is empowered to set up a separate school for juvenile delinquents working with the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.151" offset="2448509">It's a policymaking board what position should the county board take with reference to juvenile delinqeuncy in the county of education of youth.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.941" offset="2491664">What position should it take as to what taxes should go for special education or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.808" offset="2519144">Now, another peculiar twist is that the constituent assembly, and by the constituent assembly we say that this one representative of each school district whether it be the one representing 201,000 or 100 people has the ultimate power under the Act, this constituent assembly, the ultimate veto power on the amount of taxes that will be levied by this county board.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.963" offset="2663758">Now, we assert and claim that this is nothing more than a sophisticated method of depriving the people of equal representation and although more so in this case because it has the power to tax, because it has the power to bond, because it imposes obligations on people, not school districts, not on stamps, but on everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.078" offset="2808268">It may have and does have the power to oppose the same tax on an elector, a person who lives in the Grand Rapids School District whether 201,000 people as it has for Nelson Center that has 100 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.989" offset="2895935">And we submit that with this all powerful power to tax, that with this all powerful policymaking legislative body which it is in determining policy in the County of Kent that it must be under logic commonsense because it is the contention of the appellant, James Sailors and others in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3285.177" offset="13140637">Well, its powers since 1935 have been somewhat expanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.221" offset="13164878">When this case first started, they do not have the power to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.639" offset="13178462">What they had to do once they submit a budget to what we call the allocation board to be divided within the 15 mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.414" offset="13213571">Recently, primarily because of this great thing that come to Michigan this county special education program for handicapped children which preceded federal grants and developments in that respect in the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.619" offset="13286400">Now, that's adopted by the counties by referendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.682" offset="13302700">Now, because of that, they were given the tax power as I believe and the power to bond for the purpose of building facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.031" offset="13348049">But their powers Mr. Chief Justice are limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.539" offset="13362155">The bonding power is to the specific phases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.024" offset="13383993">Originally they took the place of a county superintendent who was a politician run for office on a partisan ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.334" offset="13421296">Then the county superintendent schools is now and I used to have historically in every state I believe is now appointed by the county board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.583" offset="13462256">That was one of the purposes of it then they use to help the rural school districts, and the teachers they would help in their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.652" offset="13502589">I think that they still do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.255" offset="13517009">They worked and originally intended to help actually the rural school districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.355" offset="13549401">And now it is expanded until it's true they do have the power to tax for very limited purposes are not broad purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.890" offset="13583464">They have -- and the power to bond is a limited power to only a bond for a certain type of facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.830" offset="13619304">That generally Mr. Chief Justice is their power.</text>

            <text syncTime="3736.378" offset="14945489">All of the cases from the government's point of view involved one overwriting and submitting an issue and that is simply stated whether the equal population requirement of Reynolds versus Sims and other cases that relate to state legislative apportionment also apply at the local level of government.</text>

            <text syncTime="4108.587" offset="16434260">Section 1253 says that direct appeal from a three-judge court's decision granting or denying an injunction lies that the case was the one required to be heard by three judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.904" offset="16491520">Now, in our view the basic jurisdictional statute with three-judge courts 2281, has been construed by this Court as relating only to situations that involved statutes of general statewide application.</text>
            <text syncTime="4141.385" offset="16565499">And we have difficulty although arguments to the contrary are made in the Suffolk County case and in the Alabama case concluding that on the basis of that construction of 2281 statutes of general statewide application that either of the Suffolk County Charter or the specific statute relating to Houston County, Alabama fit within that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.183" offset="16672705">Arguments are made to the contrary and I assume will be made by the -- for the parties but we have -- we've raised this question and as to the other two cases that we feel jurisdiction is appropriate, we think that in response to the Court's question in Number 724, that the answer to that question of whether a three-judge court should have been convened is no, it should not have been convened as the Court undoubtedly know that it was initially convened and then Circuit Judge Bryan wrote an opinion determining that the matter was local in nature and the three-judge court was not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="4204.825" offset="16819200">We feel that the procedure there was proper, the Fourth Circuit has jurisdiction and the case is properly here on appeal from the Fourth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="4225.945" offset="16903732">It seems to us that as an initial matter, this simply close logically from the basic constitutional underpinnings of Reynolds.</text>

            <text syncTime="4238.445" offset="16953678">It seems to us also that sound policy considerations argue for this result as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="4684.228" offset="18736901">But Reynolds, of course, construed the Equal Protection Clause insofar as the individual voter's right is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4690.397" offset="18761561">And it's the same individual voter in the -- in the local election in the -- as it is in the state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="4719.801" offset="18879112">I think that's right but I -- but -- but Reynolds, he asked about proportional representation schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4724.360" offset="18897398">And I don't think that Reynolds speaks necessarily proportional representation schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4729.368" offset="18917460">Illinois for instance has had an arrangement in which you had something like proportional representation scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="4735.215" offset="18940761">I don't think that was drawn out by the -- by the lower court or by this Court in reviewing that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4743.978" offset="18975869">In our view where members of these local bodies are appointed instead of elected or whether they're elected at large rather than from districts, we feel that the equal protection -- equal population principle announced in Reynolds would be inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4760.589" offset="19042325">All of the four bodies in our view that are involved here fit within the category of those covered by the principle, and we submit that includes the city council in Number 724 where at large elections are held but unequally populated residence districts are set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4778.050" offset="19112124">And it includes also the School Board in Number 430 despite the difficulties with the two-step election scheme that is presented there.</text>

            <text syncTime="4855.258" offset="19420996">It's clear that to some extent, the original -- the original city council that was set up here was not under the seven-four plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4862.402" offset="19449522">It took the six sitting former supervisors and put them on the council and the five city council members of Virginia Beach, and put them on the council.</text>
            <text syncTime="4872.587" offset="19490273">It's clear that there -- there was a relationship between the adoption of that scheme and an attempt to get both of the former bodies to go along with.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.637" offset="19530501">But I'm not sure that it wouldn't go ahead without that because the overwriting concerns seem to be avoiding annexation by the City of Norfolk.</text>

            <text syncTime="4914.929" offset="19659651">Some suggestions have made that several per curiam indicate the Court feels that the question of local apportionment is one that the Court is not going to get involved in.</text>
