            <text syncTime="35.779" offset="246471">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.391" offset="260890">This is the third time this case has been before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.315" offset="280639">The plan reviewed today represents the eight opportunity, the Florida legislature has had in the last four years to adopt a constitutional apportionment plan not counting numerous opportunities before that.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.801" offset="346572">This case was filed in March 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.311" offset="364648">In 1964, this Court reversed the District Court's dismissal of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.533" offset="389517">On February 25th of this year, this Court again reversed the District Court which had given the legislature until 1969 to convene a validly apportion of the legislature and remanded to the District Court so that a valid reapportionment plan could be made effective for the 1966 elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.740" offset="482304">This is an appeal from the latest decision of the District Court which held the deviations in the last Florida legislative plan adopted March 10th did not discriminate to use the lower court's language to any great extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.309" offset="552626">We are here for the third time because we believe the standards of your reapportionment cases have been disregarded by the District Court for the third time.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.159" offset="599960">The Florida plan is not an honest and good faith effort to construct districts in both houses of the legislature as nearly equal in population as it's practicable with only such minimal departures as necessity demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.032" offset="667460">It is not a plan under which all votes are counted equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.454" offset="689194">The current plan provides 48 senators and 117 representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.026" offset="715525">The court below found that the senate districts ranged from 15.9% overrepresented to 10.56% underrepresented or a deferential in the senate between the largest district and the smallest district of over 30%.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.167" offset="792012">In the House, the court found that the district's range from 18.28% overrepresented to 15.27% underrepresented or a deferential between the largest and the smallest districts of over 41%.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.701" offset="866200">Now, in plain language this means that three votes in the most overrepresented senate district will have the weight of four votes in the most underrepresented senate district.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.745" offset="914369">And that four votes in the most overrepresented house district will have the weight of five and a half votes in the most underrepresented house district.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.516" offset="961390">Standing by themselves alone, we think these variances are too great to pass the constitutional test laid down by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.127" offset="999842">However, when we couple list statistics with an inquiry to see if this was an honest in good faith attempt to construct districts as nearly equal in population as practicable, we come upon some rather startling facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.842" offset="1070791">This plan was adopted by an experienced legislature in direct derogation of the reapportionment standards which had been clearly articulated to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.100" offset="1119796">First, by this Court in its 1964 decision, secondly, by our lower court in its 1965 decision striking down a legislative plan in which that court stated and I quote from that decision, “only such minimal departures as necessity demands will be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.120" offset="1207881">Variations are to be sanctioned only when they cannot be avoided.”</text>
            <text syncTime="281.575" offset="1229720">Thirdly, by my Brother counsel, the Attorney General in a document which he distributed to every member of this legislature before the legislature began to sit, entitled “Criteria and Guidelines” for reapportionment as established by the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.503" offset="1297429">In that document, he told each member of the legislature the following; the allowable mathematical percentage variants differs in some of the Supreme Court decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.644" offset="1345912">However, a study of these decisions reveals that a percentage variants of more than 15% would be difficult to sustain as complying with one man, one vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.121" offset="1395858">And lastly, the legislature had before it the very plan which appellants had filed in this proceeding at the request of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.112" offset="1435773">The plan which had the same none population characteristics, the integrity of county lines and the contiguity of the districts and yet in the plans submitted by appellants which the legislature had before it for consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.113" offset="1495855">There was less than a 3.5% variance.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.476" offset="1517275">Now, with all of that guidance, what do we find that the legislature adopted?</text>
            <text syncTime="359.416" offset="1540995">A plan with variances well in excess of 15% and a plan that manifest a clear pattern of discrimination against the more populous counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.715" offset="1590209">The only counties underrepresented in the Senate by 10% or more are two of the most populous counties in the state, Duval and Palm Beach which ranked second and seventh in the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="460.754" offset="1946415">I think certainly not more than 3% or 4% would be the minimal tolerances and then only if it were shown that those tolerances could not have been avoided in the plan which was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.594" offset="2005765">Those two counties which are underrepresented by more than 10% in this plan contained 14% of the state's population or in other words, one out of every seven people in Florida lives in those populous underrepresented counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.103" offset="2083819">In addition, one of those two is also underrepresented in the House plan by almost 8%.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.934" offset="2111091">So, there is accumulative effect of discrimination that the court pointed out in the Lucas effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.863" offset="2142856">Now, what do we find on the other side who is the most overrepresented in the Senate?</text>
            <text syncTime="515.284" offset="2164485">Three of the least populous counties by over 15% in the House the same pattern of discrimination exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.436" offset="2205132">The majority of the overrepresented districts consist of the less populous counties with a little manatee leading the list with 18.3% overrepresented whereas the eight largest county in the state is 15.3% underrepresented.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.868" offset="2290813">We have given several other examples in our brief of this pattern of discrimination against the populous counties which we find in this plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.547" offset="2329579">Now, the lower court and the Attorney General passed this discrimination off in a very cavalier way without making any effort to explain the reason for this discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.678" offset="2374092">The lower court concedes in its decision the deviation exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.728" offset="2394258">We submit the burden is on the Attorney General to justify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.120" offset="2411813">These variations are not ones which in the language of the court's opinion could not be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.273" offset="2440443">They cannot be justified on any desire not to split county lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.991" offset="2463326">For example, in the plan, we find in one district which would have been ideally apportioned, the legislature purposely malapportioned it.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.958" offset="2499166">The legislature clearly was not concerned here with breaking county lines but with breaking hearts, hearts of the legislators who seeks -- should have been reapportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.233" offset="2548276">We have a curious philosophy that seems to prevail in the Florida legislature and that is that the legislative seats belong to the individual legislatures who hold them not to the people who elected them.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.167" offset="2608044">One more fact clearly indicates a lack of good faith in the attempt which the legislature made and that is the size of the plan examined today.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.226" offset="2652244">This is the largest legislature in the history of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.759" offset="2670425">Since the legislature sometime ago began tinkering with the size of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.912" offset="2691009">The Senate has crept from its original size of 32 to 48 and the House from 68 members to a 117 members.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.328" offset="2732701">Reapportionment in Florida has come to me not reallocation of existing seats but the addition of new seats in playing unvarnished ad hock personal legislation to keep the legislators there who no longer belong there under the latest federal census.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.993" offset="2807306">The personal nature of the present plan if illustrated by the grand fathering of three of the Senators and providing a residence requirement whereby the people are denied the right to vote for a candidate who resides in their district to ensure the election of a favorite senator from the less populous and different district.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.073" offset="2883688">If this Court's standards are to be avoided by such patently bad faith attempts, the importance of reapportionment in the revitalization of our state legislatures will be lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.225" offset="2932276">We submit that legislative packing is not good faith legislative reappointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.862" offset="2958817">That is why in the plan we submitted we started with the last constitutionally valid plan approved by the people of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.936" offset="2995075">The plan which the legislature has adopted, they have been very careful not to submit to the vote of the people.</text>

            <text syncTime="921.900" offset="3790973">Appellants plan shows that these wide variances cannot be justified by a desire not to split county line or to avoid none contiguous districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.462" offset="3837262">We think the Attorney General should tell the court today what justification there is for these wide variances in the Florida plan and explain for what reason these variances exist in the legislative plan when they do not exist in the plan submitted to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.036" offset="3907480">Where the variances are as great as they are in the Florida plan, the burden is on the Attorney General to justify their constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.605" offset="3953768">We believe that the Florida experience indicates the need for this Court to reaffirm that there is no maximum permissible deviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.604" offset="3997759">That the court's reapportionment formula is not algebra but that only such variances from the one man, one vote rule will be tolerated as cannot be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.221" offset="4048227">Since the reapportionment cases, the lower courts have gone in two directions.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.065" offset="4067662">One group has taken its obligation seriously and has attempted to determine how close a reapportionment plan can come to meeting exactly the reapportionment standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.098" offset="4115728">That is that each vote should be counted equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.876" offset="4130879">They have compared the enacted legislative plan with the one suggested as the best possible and if there is no justification for the variances in the enacted plan they have judicially crafted it or it enacted a better plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.560" offset="4197648">Another group has taken the opposite approach to see how far the legislature can deviate for maximum equality without transgressing constitutional limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.579" offset="4241638">This group accords a presumption of validity to the act of an invidiously discriminatory body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.965" offset="4271208">If this Court is going to allow its reapportionment decisions to be diluted by this maximum permissible deviation school we believe it will have entered the political picket and come out with nothing but a thorn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.084" offset="4335679">In its February decision this year, this Court directed that a valid reapportionment plan should be made effective in Florida for the 1966 alleged elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.734" offset="4386356">We believe that the legislature and the District Court fail to carry out this mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.855" offset="4410807">In the language of Reynolds and Simms if there has ever been a case in which the legislature has failed to reapportion according to federal constitutional requisites after having had an adequate opportunity to do so and therefore judicial relief becomes appropriate this is that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.539" offset="4489488">But the Florida legislature does not meet until April 4th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.138" offset="4507878">The adoption of a new constitution for the state of Florida it's one of its prime announced objectives of the new legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.019" offset="4543404">We submit proper judicial relief would be to place into effect appellant's plan where the maximum deviation is less than 3.5% in time to be effective for the 1967 session of the Florida legislature and before the adoption of a new constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1231.942" offset="5031163">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.029" offset="5051538">In times passed when I have not agreed that the product of the Florida legislature was a good faith attempt to meet the guidelines laid down by this Court I have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.160" offset="5107963">On this occasion, as we come before the court once again, it is my position that this product of the Florida legislature which is now before the court does represent a bona fide good faith effort on the part of this legislature to construct a rational plan of apportionment based upon population as the point of departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.703" offset="5218200">And in my reply here to my Brother Mr. Paul and I should like to touch upon these points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.552" offset="5249546">First of all, I would like to contend that his standing here as an appellant is not in best posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.386" offset="5288939">Secondly that this plan is within the guidelines which the legislature of Florida understood and it was a reasonable understanding I think of what the guidelines were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.719" offset="5334288">Thirdly, that there is no pattern of invidious discrimination in this plan which is now before the court and finally as I said this is a representive -- representative of the good faith of this legislature in adopting a population based reapportionment plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.150" offset="5407953">Now, as to the appellants Mr. Swann or Judge Swann as he is now and Dade County, the most populous county in Florida which I too, I'm a resident and citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.383" offset="5456854">In this plan, Dade County and the House of Representative has an almost perfect break on the mean legislative House district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.172" offset="5504084">I believe they're underrepresented by about 0.43 in their House of Representative districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.848" offset="5534804">They are underrepresented by 5% plus in the Senate and so I say that so far as the litigants here, the appellants are complaining, their complains are de minimus departures from the mean average in both the House and the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.069" offset="5619649">And that they're standing to complain is not in its good posture as it has been in other trips to this Court on which occasions I was trying to agree with them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2602.298" offset="10512593">If there is to be a flexibility but not as much as we have in those in this plan tell us what it is and give us the opportunity to meet at our next session with this newly elected legislature which is the greatest population base legislature in history of our state and I think there will be a compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.383" offset="10612903">I don't agree of course with my friend and Brother Mr. Paul in his lopsided view of the urban versus rural discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.908" offset="10655013">I note in his brief on page 22 I think it is, he makes a statement that no single urban county is overrepresented in both houses while at least five rural counties are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.464" offset="10705272">I would submit that -- let's take three, Volusia County that's where the Daytona Beach is, not exactly a rural place overrepresented in both houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.994" offset="10763368">Pinellas, not St. Petersburg, not exactly a rural county, overrepresented in both houses and Brevard where Kate Kennedy is located and that too is the situation and that is taking Sarasota County where the culture and art center of Florida not exactly a rural county, it's the 12th largest county in Florida, overrepresented in both houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.954" offset="10883218">So, three out of 12 of the urban counties overrepresented in both houses and as Mr. Paul says five rural counties, overrepresented in both houses there are 67 counties leaving by his definition there 55 of them rural and five out of 55 being overrepresented in both houses as compared to three out of 12 urban counties overrepresented in both counties I think is a good record on the ballots.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.645" offset="11001919">So, may it please the Court, I submit that this plan under consideration by the court is a plan which is rational, it lacks invidious discrimination, it does not gerrymander and lead the three urban counties I've just mentioned went republic in the last election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.518" offset="11081435">So, it's not gerrymandered for political advantage, it is a not gerrymandered for racial disadvantage or discrimination in any way and comes close enough to the mathematical guidelines that we've understood that I submit it is a plan that meets the constitutional standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2785.909" offset="11247052">I must confess that he was making that argument, I was reminded a little of the line competes, what mad, what hot, what fevered pursued is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.581" offset="11281742">I think clearly that by virtue of the plan that we have filed in shown that appellant Swann has the right to a constitutionally apportioned legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.729" offset="11342242">Under our plan, the appellant would be much more accurately represented than under the plan adopted by the legislature and the Attorney General makes the error several times in his briefs that saying the date is adequately represented and the Senate date is underrepresented in the legislative plan to the extent of 5.9%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.822" offset="11422699">I think the important point to that made by Mr. Justice Douglas and that is that every other intervener who has attempted to intervene in these proceedings to present their particular underrepresentation problems has been denied, leaved to intervene on the ground that this appellant was expressing the position of all the under represented voters in the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.908" offset="11507022">For example, Senator McHugh from Jacksonville, Duval County which is badly underrepresented in this plan is sought to intervene on several occasions and he has been denied his right to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.985" offset="11555297">Of course the purpose of the rule, the standing to sue is to insure that there's an adversary proceeding or a case or a controversy and I think that has clearly been met here and I think that without question that we do have standing in this proceeding.</text>
