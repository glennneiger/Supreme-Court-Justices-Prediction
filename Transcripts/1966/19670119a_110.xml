            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="49.311" offset="300596">When Congress Congress enacted legislation against product boycotts, it had a specific evil in mind namely employer refusals to handle the products of another employer who was involved in a labor dispute or who was nonunion or who was otherwise disfavored, otherwise disfavored by the union representing those particular employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.050" offset="395577">And that this was a device to exert to a neutral employer pressure, pressure upon the employer disfavored by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.711" offset="434239">Now in determining whether or not refusals to handle products coming from another employer, whether that was refusals are a violation of the statutes or whether or not we must look in the light of the purpose of Congress, we must look to the objective of the employees or the union that's directing them to refuse to handle the products coming from another employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.865" offset="534862">Now, let me explain my meaning with two illustrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.719" offset="558268">Supposed for example that you have my -- employer A, employer A buys doors from manufacturer B.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.119" offset="591809">The employees of employer A are union.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.771" offset="602467">Those of employer B are nonunion.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.551" offset="613543">The employees of A refuse to install the doors coming from B because B's doors do not bear the union label and B, his employees are nonunion.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.235" offset="668296">That was the situation under Sand Door Case which was before this Court several years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.590" offset="689716">Now let me give a second illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.040" offset="707584">Employer A under his contract with this collective bargaining agreement with his employees is required and has traditionally given them certain work to be done on doors, the finishing of unfinished doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.850" offset="770800">Now employer A decides that he is going to buy finished doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.336" offset="788668">And when these finished doors come to him, his employees refused to install those doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.769" offset="814477">The reason that they are refusing to install those doors is because the employer in violation of his agreement not to assign the finishing work to someone else, to preserve it for them as -- deprive them of work which they have traditionally been performing and work which under their contract they're entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.175" offset="900054">Now essentially, that is the case before this Court involving the employer of the contract to Frouge.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.791" offset="930565">That is not a secondary boycott situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.805" offset="946552">All that the two, the two examples which I've given can be loosely called as product boycotts.</text>

            <text syncTime="235.139" offset="1043937">I'm speaking of the product boycotts.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.575" offset="1053654">As I said, the two illustrations which I've given to the Court, they are enti -- although in the sense they can be said to involve product boycotts.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.101" offset="1087822">Product boycotts, they are analytically different because the object of the employees who are refusing to handle the products are entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.747" offset="1130350">And the difference in their object makes for wholly different results under the statute a result which should not be blurred by simply imposing upon them the label, product boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.176" offset="1180087">In the first case that I gave, in the first case I gave where the employees of the union re -- union employer A refused to handle the doors coming from a nonunion source, there the employees have no dispute whether own employer over the terms or conditions of their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.663" offset="1254066">Their dispute is with the manufacturer B who is nonunion.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.278" offset="1268485">And his doors do not bear a union label.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.198" offset="1280188">When they refuse to perform services for employer A, their own employer, and install these doors, they are seeking to exert secondary pressure upon B, the disfavored employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.889" offset="1330970">That was I said was a situation before this Court in the Sand Door Case in which the Court held that this was a violation of the secondary boycott provisions of the stat -- of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.836" offset="1374751">Now, in the second example which I gave, which should I say is essentially the case before this Court involving in.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.566" offset="1401605">And in the Frouge incidence -- in the Frouge incident, in the second case, the employees of employer A, they're not concerned with the manufacture of the doors or the conditions under which those doors are manufactured.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.229" offset="1464299">Their concern is solely with res -- solely over the loss of their work which they have traditionally been performing for their employer which under their agreement, he's agreed to give to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.826" offset="1514663">Their dispute, the target of their action is their immediate employer over their own immediate work opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.252" offset="1552384">That is not a secondary boycott at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1914.474" offset="7761272">Let me address myself to that question and I think I know what may be troubling the Court there because there seems to be some apparent inconsistency between the board saying in the case of Frouge, it was permissible legitimate primary activity but in the case of the other employer it was secondary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.445" offset="7845177">Now let's see if I can explain that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.531" offset="7857507">All of these contractors here were parties to the collective bargaining agreement that effect of which was to bar them from subcontracting the finishing of -- the finishing work on doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.529" offset="7921455">Three of these employers -- three of these contractors, I'm sorry, I moved away from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.577" offset="7945697">Three of these contractors here who are parties to this agreement here, they ignored their agreement and the accepted specifications from the project owners and those specifications called for finished doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.849" offset="8002748">The fourth contractor, Frouge, the fourth contractor, his specifications did not require him to use those doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.573" offset="8037648">Now with respect with to the three employers who in this regard of their own collective bargaining agreement or whatever obligations they may have owed to their employees under that agreement in disregard of that, they have taken as I say a contract which is now taking the work out of their hands, and of course their employers have been denied of certain work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.650" offset="8113925">Now in that case, the board held that this was secondary activity because the control, the control over the dispute had passed from those contractors to the project owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.210" offset="8168260">That in that particular context the board then deemed the union's refusal to install the doors as being direct at least impart, that had been directed at least to impart to neutral employers namely the project owners.</text>

            <text syncTime="2639.942" offset="10663163">Now first, I'd like to suggest that we must remember that in this case, this union boycott on all four jobs prevented the use of prefabricated doors and Rule 17 prevented the use of prefabricated doors in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.376" offset="10716871">Now let's look at this control theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="2702.668" offset="10914043">Whatever trust control had, where did it point?</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.145" offset="10927940">It pointed only to the con -- project owner on the three jobs where the doors were specified.</text>

            <text syncTime="2716.935" offset="10971094">But what did the board claim?</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.586" offset="10977677">That the objective was not only the owners but the manufacturers and the distributors of the door, there it saw irrespective of controller on the three jobs where violations were found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.239" offset="11020309">There was found a boycott objective against doors and the manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.557" offset="11037550">And so with Frouge, it was identically the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.503" offset="11049357">Whatever trust control had pointing at Frouge, was purely incidental because on that case the boycott objective was precisely the same.</text>
