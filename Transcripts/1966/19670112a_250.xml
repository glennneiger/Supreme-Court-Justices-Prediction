            <text syncTime="2001.070" offset="8107656">Now, the Attorney General in response to all of these about the hair offers two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.982" offset="8131271">One point is a formal one that no request was made by the accused counsel of -- for the evidence we claim was suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.075" offset="8183724">This, we are submitting to Your Honors, that the Brady against Maryland cannot be read as requiring such a request and we have cited the case, U.S. versus Wilkins decided by Judge Thurgood Marshall which reviews all the authorities on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.842" offset="8258748">Incidentally, this point was very similar to the point that bothered the Court before the Jencks case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.587" offset="8289677">It was very much the same point that a report was available to contradict and the question was raised and the point was made in Mr. Justice Brennan's opinion in the Jencks case that how could anyone be expected to know the contents of report they hadn't seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.904" offset="8363029">The other point that the Attorney General makes is that the accused himself somehow knew because of this colloquy that took place during the 52-hour detention period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.147" offset="8427917">Note, the Attorney General is in the awkward position of claiming that the accused -- a statement they made to the accused that hairs matched is to be treated as fulfillment of their obligation under the Constitution to disclose that the hairs did not match.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.258" offset="8504404">Now, there was no disclosure at all that the hair within the child's vagina didn't match the accused hair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.257" offset="8540348">There was simply some general garble conversation during this long detention period about hairs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2192.883" offset="8874924">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.165" offset="8892061">The contentions of the petitioner in this case can be basically summarized into two broad categories, one, the lack of access to certain information, and secondly, the validity of the admission of his confession at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.550" offset="8969592">Concerning first, the issue of the defense's access to information perhaps their most significant issue is that of the finding of the hair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.196" offset="9024136">Now, with respect to this issue, it is important to first determine what was revealed and what was not revealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.003" offset="9067395">At the District Court, when the petitioner testified, he testified that when in those same proceedings he had heard the state's attorney testify as to the result of this examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.082" offset="9111698">This was the first he had ever heard about that hair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.937" offset="9127163">However, this conclusion is cast into doubt by his testimony at the trial itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.440" offset="9157151">Now, I'm talking about the chambers testimony that he gave when the question of his -- the admissibility of his confession first arose for the determination by the Court before it was submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.471" offset="9221308">At that time, he testified that in effect he testified, “They took some pubic hairs from me.</text>
