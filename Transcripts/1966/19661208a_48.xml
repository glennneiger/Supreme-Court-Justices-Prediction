            <text syncTime="1603.047" offset="6515545">The usher of the case here presents two problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.480" offset="6533308">One, did the petitioner raise the federal question that he is urging before Your Honors now at -- in the appropriate time?</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.947" offset="6567163">Secondly, if he did not, is there any merit to the points that he does raise?</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.053" offset="6587538">I should point out to the court that we are urging that in our brief that he did not raise the federal questions in the appropriate time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.544" offset="6625573">I should point out that in the opposition for petition for certiorari where we should have raised this point, our point was not raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.455" offset="6653158">We were not counsel at that stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.946" offset="6659114">When we came in we thought that this was a jurisdictional problem and we do raise it at this late stage of the game.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.242" offset="6680325">We do think it's appropriate for the court to consider this time on behalf of the respondent we apologize for not raising it to you at the time when a petition for certiorari was before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.782" offset="6722539">The facts are very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.593" offset="6729749">At the trial the case was tried on the assumption that this was the case of ordinary negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.725" offset="6758275">When judgment was entered for the plaintiff and it was convened for the court, I'll refer to the parties, this plaintiff and the defendant because they then interchange our position when they'd come to the Michigan Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.596" offset="6809788">But when judgment was -- for the plaintiff the defendant appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.710" offset="6834239">In the Michigan Supreme Court for the first time it called attention to Act 201.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.165" offset="6852002">Act 201 on the face of it deprives the court below of jurisdiction that provides that there's no cause of action shall arise when people are upon the lands of another for the purpose of hunting, fishing or trapping unless there's either compensation paid or unless the occupier of the land is guilty of gross negligence or wanton and willful misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.909" offset="6930996">In the brief before the Michigan Supreme Court the question was specifically raised and we have incorporated as an Appendix A to our brief in this Court the portion of our brief raising this point in the portion of the plaintiff's brief and required thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.020" offset="7003408">We specifically raised the question, whether the Court of Appeal -- whether the Supreme Court could consider Act 201 as dispositive even though it had not been raised in the court below?</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.671" offset="7054085">We raises the question, we brief to point -- we specifically pointed out that under the cases that we cited that while normally it look -- the -- an appellate court would not consider a point for the first time when raised there when it had not been raised below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.533" offset="7109465">That it was a matter -- that the court could consider and that if it were a case like the instant one where there was a statute which removed the cause of action as one that court should consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.394" offset="7152933">More or less we point that moreover we pointed out that as we interpreted the statute it was not a matter of defense for the defendant to raise but was a matter of the cause of action of the plaintiff and therefore it was something that the plaintiff should have addressed himself to.</text>

            <text syncTime="2360.489" offset="9545331">The cases are very clear that where the State Supreme Court refuses to write an opinion but just disposes a petition for rehearing without an opinion that the fact that the petitioner raises at that stage is too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.735" offset="9598307">There's a second line of a case that we are -- where it create an exception, there are the case of Saunders v. Shaw and the Brinkerhoff case that we cite.</text>

            <text syncTime="2401.647" offset="9710007">It's almost a case of entrapment or almost of sandbagging to use a colloquial expression.</text>

            <text syncTime="2429.734" offset="9822333">Now, it so happen that prior to the Brinkerhoff in the lower court, the decisions of that same Supreme Court have held that the administrative remedies were not in fact available to a taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.831" offset="9870712">The Supreme Court of the State in Brinkerhoff overruled its earlier opinion and said, "We were wrong."</text>

            <text syncTime="2459.055" offset="9939571">There, a taxpayer didn't follow an administrative proceeding that was not available to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.136" offset="9967888">As a matter of fact in Brinkerhoff, the court itself -- this Court made clear that had there not been a prior opinion of the state courts specifically holding that the administrative remedy was not available, in other words had the question been undecided up to that point, then the taxpayer would run the risk of making up his mind of interpreting the state law as to whether the administrative remedy was or was not in fact available to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.363" offset="10064854">And if he guessed wrong on that, the Supreme Court of the State could throw him out for failure to exhaust administrative remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.322" offset="10088678">What the -- what this Court said in Brinkerhoff was that would the -- that where the Lower Supreme Court, whether the Supreme Court of the State have previously -- explicitly held that the remedy was not available it could not and the very opinion reversing that earlier opinion come back and say, "But we were wrong before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.030" offset="10159522">We reversed it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3153.008" offset="12715447">I could've shown three things, one, that David himself owned no traps, couldn't physically even set a trap so he wouldn't -- couldn't be a -- possibly be a trapper and we could cover for ordinary negligence for David.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.843" offset="12798725">And as for James, James owned traps and he was trapping.</text>

            <text syncTime="3187.494" offset="12853373">But in any event I could have gone ahead and even claimed as far as James is concern, gross negligence, namely that that they had such dangerous condition, they knew that many people came upon their land, a couple of (Inaudible) sign of warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.063" offset="12911574">They could've prevented this in showing that there was really a trap.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.122" offset="12923904">I should've -- had that opportunity, but again this illustrates that really equal protection is denied to this children because why should two children, David and James, why should David go on the land and be able because he's not trapping but going along with his brother, recover for ordinary negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.925" offset="12995062">And his brother, who has a trap and is going to set a trap on that land have to prove gross negligence.</text>
