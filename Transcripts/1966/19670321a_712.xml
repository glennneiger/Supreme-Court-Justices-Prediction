            <text syncTime="49.652" offset="301955">This case, likely, the case that had just been concluded, involves the housing rights of the disadvantaged citizens in our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.372" offset="344900">However, this case which is here on certiorari from the Supreme Court of North Carolina involves no issue of state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.077" offset="383666">It is conceded that the respondent, Housing Authority of the City of Durham, is an agency of the State operating under State statutes and operating a low-income public housing project under a contract with the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.586" offset="465690">The question presented here is also not one directly involving any racial discrimination claim, but rather the more general one of whether a public housing authority may terminate a tenant's housing benefits, entirely arbritrarily, without giving any reason, without being accountable at all for what it does.</text>

            <text syncTime="126.674" offset="610095">Your Honor's question relates to our reply brief and to the regulation adopted on February 7th after our briefs were filed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.082" offset="663698">In the first part of our reply brief, we have set forth an argument which we think, would support the decision by this Court, reversing the decision below and setting aside this eviction on non-constitutional ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.244" offset="760351">However, we urge that the Court consider the constitutional questions and exercise its discretion to decide them for several important reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.370" offset="812805">We think that first, it is vital and most important that the -- this Court may claim that the rights of public housing tenants under the -- are protected under the Constitution that -- that public housing tenants have rights which the Court will protect and which the Public Housing Authority must respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.497" offset="957315">It's -- it's no accident, I think, that 30 years have gone by since this Federal Housing Program was first adopted, and this is the first case to come to this Court where the tenants were in a position to assert rights against the Public Housing Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.089" offset="1027741">And that's because these are people who don't have the money to litigate cases and who will rarely have the opportunity to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.661" offset="1065984">So it's most important that if their constitutional rights are going to be protected, they're going to have to be protected by the administrative agencies, and the way that the administrative agencies can be stimulated to act is through a judicial decision, that February 7th Regulation represents that.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.079" offset="1139649">It was only after this Court had granted certiorari that the longstanding policy was reversed so that --</text>

            <text syncTime="419.222" offset="1780276">Well, now -- now, we're getting, Mr. Justice Douglas, to the area of -- of where the, certainly, regulation is not precise and specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.351" offset="1840776">For example, the regulation doesn't use the word hearing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.996" offset="1867316">It says that it uses the term “private conference” and suggests that tenants be given an opportunity to make such reply or explanation as he may wish.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.616" offset="1945788">Now, if that means what I would call a hearing, that is a rudimentary due process proceeding where the tenant would have the right to know what authority was placed against him were, where he would have some sort of opportunity to probe their -- their case, to find out what facts they relied on and to -- and to challenge them with his own version of the facts, if he contested, assuming he contested them, and would -- and would have the right to have an impartial decision, and to know at the end of the hearing process what ground they rely on for their decision making.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.806" offset="2114644">And I think the circular can be construed by this Court to require it.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.438" offset="2137109">Then the Court might be able to avoid the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.782" offset="2158529">However, I think, as I began this entire discussion by saying as part to Mr. Justice Harlan's first inquiry that we think it important that the Court in these circumstances decide the -- the constitutional issue, the due process issue, and in doing so, might serve some of the same policies that are normally served by avoiding constitutional questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2343.245" offset="9476368">In answer to something Mr. Justice Douglas asked, this is certainly not a First Amendment case.Whatever it is, it's not that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.616" offset="9509804">This issue having been decided, there was a contention about the First Amendment rights, but that the issue was decided by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.376" offset="9544913">The juror and was waived by both parties and has agreed that the judge is to decide the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.070" offset="9571662">The petitioner at that stage of the game was not prevented from introducing any evidence about any reason that she could think of for her eviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.467" offset="9609279">She had available to her discovery procedure -- procedures under state courts to find out if she want to do at that stage, what the reasons or advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.083" offset="9643656">He did not ask to use any of those and -- and confine themselves to this allegation that she was evicted because of the First Amendment right to assemble.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.055" offset="9687542">And then at the same time said she didn't know the reason because they wouldn't tell the reason, and somewhat contradictory is true, but the facts were found against her and the significant thing is that she was not precluded by the trial court from asserting any constitutional right that she might have felt had been violated in that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.269" offset="9772492">And so this case then, I think, presents the question has been suggested that can the government in any level, whether it is the local or state or national inject funds and money, public money into a housing program without at the same time being required by the Constitution to abandon the ordinary and normal rules governing landlord and tenant that are applicable throughout the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.342" offset="9876773">In other words, all those normal procedures of leasing and of renting are so or at least so unusual and outlandish as to -- as to be unconstitutional when the Government has used its physical powers to promote a housing project or any sort of housing program in the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.758" offset="9962454">I'd like to, and I think that that is the essence of this case, is this lease which is not an unusual lease, it's a 30-day lease which is automatically renewable unless a 15-day notice is given to terminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.980" offset="10027342">Is that an inviolate instrument?</text>

            <text syncTime="3761.804" offset="15150582">There are some cases on -- on page 9 of the brief that have to do with instances just of this sort where all that appears was that the tenant was given a notice to -- that the lease would terminate, it would not be renewed without and all, without any other reason being given for the eviction, and that reason was held to be sufficient about those state course.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.542" offset="15253504">Now, it's been universally held that where a reason was given and that that reason was an unconstitutional reason, then the eviction wouldn't stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.624" offset="15293837">But it's also been held universally wherever the question has arisen that where there's no reason given, then there was no constitutional requirement that the -- the notice that they're going to terminate the lease contain some reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="3842.624" offset="15473873">So, what we say here is that we had a lease that was not arbitrary and not out of line with leases generally in use, among landlords and tenants, that we have here a court proceeding that was in no way arbitrary, and that she had full opportunity during the court proceeding to present evidence on any issue of constitutionality that she saw fit to present it on, that she did in fact do so, that issue or fact was decided against her, and therefore there is no constitutional issue left in this case before this Court.</text>
