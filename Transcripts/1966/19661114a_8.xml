            <label>Mr. Kevin T. Maroney</label>
            <text syncTime="12.852" offset="154728">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.012" offset="175417">This is a criminal case which arose in the United States District Court, the Western District of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.526" offset="205511">The indictment in the case charged the appellee with unlawfully from November 1962 to the date of the indictment, engaging in employment in a defense facility designated as such by the Secretary of Defense, while at the same time, being a member of the Communist Party, a Communist Action Organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.192" offset="300178">The defendant having knowledge of the designation of the defense facility and also having knowledge of the Communist Parties having them finally found to be a Communist Action Organization within the meaning of the statute the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.817" offset="378650">I'm going to the statute in more detail in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.463" offset="401220">On appellees motion to dismiss in the District Court, the trial judge relying on this Court's opinions in the Scales case, Noto case, Brown and Aptheker held that in order for the statute here to be constitutional which post grabs of course, membership in the party while concurrently engaging in employment in a defense facility that the statute would have to be interpreted in such a way as to require active membership, knowledge of the unlawful purposes of the organization, and specific intent to bring about such unlawful purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.612" offset="593795">Based on that construction, the Court dismissed the indictment, and the government filed a Notice of Appeal in the Court of Appeals with Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.749" offset="638412">Subsequently on the basis of the direct appeal statute and following our unopposed motion in the Ninth Circuit, that Court certified the case to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.584" offset="713749">The pertinent parts of the statute, the Subversive Activities Control Act which are involved in the appeal are set forth in our brief beginning at page 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.519" offset="761396">First of all the term Communist Action Organization is defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.324" offset="776652">Of course, the Court is fully familiar with the definition which was involved in the Communist Party Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.604" offset="813746">The term “facility” as used in the statute, means any plant, factory, or other manufacturing, producing, or service establishment, airport facility, vessel pier, waterfront facility, mine, railroad, public utility, laboratory, station, or other establishments or facility, or any part, division or department of any of the foregoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.885" offset="910921">The term “defense facility”, as defined in the statute, means a facility designated by the Secretary of Defense, pursuant to Section 5 (D).</text>
            <text syncTime="214.359" offset="960763">Section 5 (D) authorizes the Secretary of Defense to designate facilities with respect to the operation of which he finds and determines that the Security of the United States requires the application of the provision of subsection (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="232.525" offset="1033488">Subsection (a) Section 5 (a) which was the basis for the indictment in this case, provides that when a Communist Organization is registered or there is an effect to final order of the board requiring registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.107" offset="1111751">It shall be unlawful in the particular part we're here concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.869" offset="1130872">For any member of such organization, with knowledge or a notice that such organization is so registered or that there is an effect to final order of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.981" offset="1171310">It's unlawful for such a member, subsection (b), if such organization is a Communist Action Organization as it is here, to engage in any employment in any defense facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.546" offset="1253543">Now, I might also point out before going further that the Section 5 (D), as it was originally enacted in 1950, required that the Secretary of Defense promulgate a list of defense facilities which had been designated by him for purposes of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.110" offset="1367855">Statute of course, was passed in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.095" offset="1375796">This section did not become operative, meaningfully operative until 1961 when the final -- when the order against the Communist Party to register as a Communist Action Organization became final.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.494" offset="1445386">After that order did become final in October 1961, the Defense Department based on its determination that the publication of a master list of defense facilities would be very highly undesirable since such a master list of our strategic and vital facilities could be used as a guidebook for sabotage or espionage operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.873" offset="1578820">Because of that determination, the Executive Branch recommended to Congress and Congress adopted an amendment which provided the procedure which is contained in present Section 5 (D).</text>
            <text syncTime="384.701" offset="1642141">That is instead of a publication of a list in the federal register, the Secretary advises the defense facility and there is the requirement that such determination be posted conspicuously in the defense facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.635" offset="1713925">This posting requirement is contemplated to be done in such a way as to ensure that actual notice of the designation and of the status of the Communist Party will be brought home to each employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.514" offset="1805458">We have outlined in our brief the background to the Internal Security Act and the concern which was shown by Congress for the adequacy of the existing loyalty security procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.539" offset="1893543">We submit that the manner in which the District Court contrude this statute defeats the intent of Congress in enacting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.661" offset="1942026">As construed by the District Court and in the words of Judge Wyzanski in the vendor case, regards the arsenal, only against those and who satchels, bombs have already been found.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.343" offset="1996779">We submit that it was the intent of Congress to bar those whose loyalty is in doubt and not those of proven disloyalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.506" offset="2057383">The question of the adequacy of existing loyalty security program was really presented to Congress when it was considering various bills which led to the enactment of the Internal Security Act in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.220" offset="2128227">One bill which was submitted and being considered by Congress would have imposed penalties on any federal employee or person employed in the performance of any national defense project, who became or remained a member of the Communist Party while so employed, or a member of any other organization designated by the attorney general.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.505" offset="2229373">The Department of Justice opposed that legislation on the basis that it would constitute a bill of attainder that the bill contained no legislative findings, and in any event that the existing procedures concerning the control of the industrial personal security program were adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.712" offset="2330206">Congress met the first two objections by defining the class more narrowly than by reference to the Communist Party or to any other organization designated by the attorney general, defining the class as a Communist Action Organization within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.259" offset="2400423">And in addition, the bill which was adopted contained extensive legislative findings to support the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.857" offset="2446817">So that despite the objections voiced by the Department of Justice concerning the adequacy of existing loyalty security procedures in the industrial security field Congress --</text>

            <text syncTime="638.997" offset="2659349">Congress did not use or did not make it applicable to members of the Communist Party by name or any other organization thus to any body attorney general.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.763" offset="2714415">It made it applicable to members of a Communist Action Organization within a meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.748" offset="2742314">Of course, Congress set forth in the statute the general definition of Communist Action Organization as being any organization within the United States that is dominated and controlled by the Soviet Union, the leader of the International Communist movement, and which is operated primarily to advance the objectives of the International Communist movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.723" offset="2846281">So that its objective standard was to establish as to what is a Communist Action Organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.196" offset="2876165">Any member who is a member of – any person who is a member of such organization is under the section disqualified from engaging in defense facility employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="722.546" offset="2993507">I wondered about that as I look at the language in that.</text>

            <text syncTime="731.197" offset="3028198">I think that the Subversive Activity's control board in making its findings in the Communist Party case, made the determination that the foreign government controlling the International Communist movement which is referred to in the Internal Security Act is in fact the Soviet Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.520" offset="3113462">This Court in reviewing those findings agreed that it was the Soviet Union, that the Soviet Union was the foreign country referred to in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="927.136" offset="3811871">Despite the disagreement between the executive and the legislative branch, as to the adequacy of the then existing security programs as I indicated earlier, Congress was of the contrary view and clearly intended by the statute to extend the coverage to employees of defense facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.922" offset="3927019">Now, at that time and today of course, there is an industrial personnel security program which does cover employees of private contractors who are working on classified government information under government contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.651" offset="4001938">But that security program does not cover or did not cover 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.260" offset="4032449">Employees of important defense facilities which were vital to our defense effort, who we're not engaged in working on government contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.293" offset="4088560">And this provision was designed to extend the security program to cover that open space.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.678" offset="4126072">Certainly, there was no disagreement between the Executive Branch and the Legislative Branch on the substantial dangers from the possibility of espionage and sabotage wherein members of Communist organizations we're concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.319" offset="4200678">President Truman, although he vetoed the entire Act and specifically referred to this section in his veto message had this to say and except within our brief of page 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.952" offset="4291166">He said the dangers of communism come not from normal political activity but from espionage and sabotage in the building up of an organization, dedicated to the destruction of our government by violent means.</text>

            <text syncTime="2772.424" offset="11193031">You know, that facility was engaged that time in a classified military project working on these two destroyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.678" offset="11254053">Now, the District Court relied on four cases to make the determination that these elements of activity and knowledge of unlawful purposes and specific intents should be read into the statute in order to hold it to be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.266" offset="11336391">The Scales case and Noto case I think are clearly inapposite since they -- those were prosecutions which, under a statute, which made membership in an organization advocating overthrow, a criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.233" offset="11408280">It was a direct prohibition against membership in such organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.849" offset="11430745">And since it was a direct partial abridgement of First Amendment activities, this Court felt it reasonable to include and to read in the elements of activity and knowledge of unlawful purposes and specific intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.480" offset="11509321">Here, of course, it is not Congress' desire and it was not ongress' purpose in passing the statute to punish membership in a Communist-action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.109" offset="11547773">The purpose of this statute is strictly prophylactic purpose, and it punishes only the combination of the element of membership in a Communist-action organization while at the same time being an employee of a defense facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.526" offset="11613497">And in that respect, we think that it's quite similar to the Banking Act provision which this Court upheld in Board of Governors v. Agnew which was, of course, basically a conflict of interest statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3475.900" offset="14006941">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.925" offset="14023032">I'd like to make it perfectly clear that the outset, something that I think Mr. Maroney said, but -- is at the heart of this case and that is that this statute Section 5 (a) (1) (D) makes it a crime for a person to work in a facility that the Secretary of Defense has designated as a defense facility solely because of the bare fact that he holds membership in a Communist-action organization that has been designated as such by the Secretary of Defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.325" offset="14168691">Now, Judge Lindberg, the District Judge thought and I think quite properly that the statute of this time applies in the face of this Court's decisions in the Scales case and more pertinently in the Aptheker case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.291" offset="14240580">And in order to get around what he considered to be that constitutional infirmity in reluctant to declare a federal statute unconstitutional, he reinterpreted the statute by reading into it elements that the statute doesn't have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.005" offset="14299408">That is to say the element of knowledge on the part of the accused that the organization of which he is a member has an unlawful purpose, an intent to effectuate that purpose and activity looking to that entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.639" offset="14357922">And it's so construed, he said, the statute might be constitutional and he therefore dismissed the indictment because it doesn't contain these allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.296" offset="14396583">Now, we agree with the government that the District Court was wrong in its interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.681" offset="14418108">The statute doesn't bear the construction, but Judge Lindberg gave it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.713" offset="14442245">And on that question, it's your decision in Aptheker's controlling, that the Aptheker said that's exactly the same thing about Section 6 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.688" offset="14478085">Section 6 makes the bare fact of membership in an organization that has been order to register as a Communist-action organization, a disqualification for obtaining a passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.465" offset="14529181">The Court said you can't cure this statute by reading the elements of knowledge and intent and activity into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.184" offset="14580067">And that decision with respect to Section 6, I submit, is applicable with equal force to the section we have here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.771" offset="14614444">Now, in the absence of these elements, knowledge -- guilty knowledge activity and intent, I submit that the section is unconstitutional in the first place because it violates the due process principle that the government may not arbitrarily and unreasonably interfere with the right of an individual to hold specified private employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.603" offset="14717785">Mr. Maroney defends the statute as a reasonable measure in the interest of protecting the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.321" offset="14756655">But if the government had deliberately setout to find a case which would most strikingly illustrate the fallacy of that claim, it couldn't have done better than to pick this one.</text>

            <text syncTime="3689.457" offset="14861249">To send Robel to prison, under this indictment, would not only deprive him of his personal liberty, and Todd, a good machinist, that it would chip away at the freedom of every American and for no conceivable or discernable purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.706" offset="14938154">Because Robel and others like him who as the government's brief concedes and I quote from it, “Would never consider committing either espionage or sabotage, post no conceivable threat to our national security”, or would there conviction and sentenced under this statute served any legitimate governmental interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.602" offset="15025821">The invalidity of this indiscriminate restraint of the right to work is established by the decision in Aptheker which invalidated the similar indiscriminate restriction of Section 6 of the Act on the right to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.893" offset="15090918">And I must say that I consider it a real feat on Mr. Maroney's part to have talked about this case for 55 minutes before he mentioned the Aptheker case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.781" offset="15138461">Because the two are, from a legal point of view on this question is like this two-piece in a pod, Section 5 like Section 6 applies to members who do not know that the Communist Party has any unlawful purpose and who believed that the finding of the Subversive Activities Control Board that the Communist Party is a Soviet agent, he spoke on truthful and unwarranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.415" offset="15252982">The section is therefore invalid because in Aptheker's words, and I quote from it, it sweeps within its prohibition both knowing and unknowing members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.790" offset="15298539">Furthermore, Section 5 like Section 6, again to quote Aptheker, also renders a relevant, the member's degree of activity in the organization and his commitment to its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.998" offset="15363323">Furthermore, Section 5 as Aptheker said of Section 6, excludes consideration of additional relevant factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.508" offset="15397386">It applies to every job in an establishment that's been designated as a defense facility even to jobs which from a security point of view are completely insensitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.442" offset="15445138">And it applies to all members of the organization who hold these jobs, even though in doing so, they are motivated by nothing more dangerous than the common desire of all us to earn a living.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.711" offset="15502190">Section 6 like -- or Section 5 like Section 6, therefore, is an extreme example of the imputation of guilt from associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.958" offset="15539179">It established an irrebuttable presumption that every member of the Communist Party merely because of the fact of his membership is likely to endanger the national defense every time he has given access to a defense facility, to the premises of the defense facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.093" offset="15611695">This presumption is invalid because as Aptheker stated and again I quote, “it is supported only by a tenuous relationship between the bare fact or organizational membership and the activity Congress sought to prescribe.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.473" offset="15673240">Furthermore, as in the case of Section 6, Congress could have accomplished it's objectives by less drastic because more discriminating means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.387" offset="15712946">These are exemplified, these means, in the first place by the industrial security program that Mr. Maroney mentioned a program administered by the Department of Defense and presently applicable to the employees of the defense contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.158" offset="15775953">Congress could of course, very readily have extended it, if it wanted too, to all employees of defense facilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="3950.221" offset="15904266">But I'll come to that in just one moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3952.739" offset="15914297">This industrial security program and its predecessors date back to World War II and there is nothing to indicate and Mr. Maroney said nothing to indicate that the program hasn't proved entirely adequate as an internal security measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.610" offset="15981798">The program is less drastic than Section 5 (a) (1) (D) in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.698" offset="16006144">First, it makes membership in a Communist organization, only one factor to be considered in connection with all of the surrounding circumstances in determining whether an employee is a security risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3989.290" offset="16060583">And second, persons are denied security -- who are denied security clearance, aren't barred from all employment in the plant, they are only barred, from access to classified information and to jobs of course, which require such access.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.291" offset="16132577">This approach reflects the common sense view that there is no danger in applying a security risk in a job that's completely insensitive.</text>

            <text syncTime="4050.558" offset="16305612">But as Mr. Maroney told us, he's fired, removed from these -- from a sensitive work that's going out in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4056.312" offset="16328600">He doesn't have access to the parts of the shipyard where they're building destroyers or engaging in other sensitive activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="4069.347" offset="16380740">And I call your attention Mr. Justice Fortas to Cole versus Young in which the Court, because of this consideration, interpreted the security statute -- or not the security statute, in that case with the President's Executive Order, as applying only to security sensitive jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4088.394" offset="16456913">The 1957 Report of the Commission on Government Security, similarly to the industrial security program, opposed the exclusion of security risks from non-sensitive employment, labeling such a measure, and I quote, “objectionable and unnecessary.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4319.201" offset="17380185">Now, he stated and answered I think to a question from the Chief Justice that this statute cures the objection that the Department then found to that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.395" offset="17428982">Of course, this statute doesn't cure the Department's objection, the Department changed its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.216" offset="17464195">The letter from the Department to the Committee of Congress which was considering that measure is quoted at page 513 of the Aptheker case and here's what acting Attorney General Ford said to that bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.052" offset="17523545">“The bill would brand the member of a listed organization a felon, no matter how innocent his membership; the loyalty program enables the member to respond to charges against him and to show, in a manner consistent with American concepts of fairness and justice, that his membership is innocent and does not reflect on his loyalty."</text>
            <text syncTime="4374.470" offset="17601285">Now that's exactly the kind of a showing that this statute denies to Robel in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4384.505" offset="17641409">There is no substance to the government's attempts to distinguish this case from Aptheker and let me address myself to the distinctions that the government urges in its brief, since Mr. Maroney spoke only very briefly on the question during his portion of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4406.269" offset="17728449">First, the government says that Section 6 is broader than Section 5 (a) (1) (D), the section were dealing with here because Section 6 supplies to Communist-fund organizations while this section applies only to member of Communist-action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4424.207" offset="17800234">But Aptheker, invalidated Section 6 as applied to members of the Communist Party and to leading members of the Communist Party or persons characterized as top-ranking party leaders at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.397" offset="17860942">Second, the government says that the right to travel is more basic than the right to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="4445.532" offset="17885497">This belies what it said in its brief in Aptheker case that the denial of passports and I quote “is a considerably milder disability than the loss of employment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4455.930" offset="17927084">Of course both rights are basic.Section 5 and Section 6 are, and they were intended to be complementary and together to make life intolerable for Communists.</text>
            <text syncTime="4467.544" offset="17973582">As Justice Black put it in his dissent in the Party Registration case and I quote, “The Act makes it extremely difficult for a member of the Communist Party to live in this country and at the same time, makes it a crime for him to try and get a passport to get out”.</text>
            <text syncTime="4484.698" offset="18042128">Furthermore, this Court in Wieman versus Updegraff and on the last term in Elfbrandt versus Russell, applied the rule invoked in Aptheker to invalidate a statute making membership in a Communist organization, a disqualification for employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4503.264" offset="18116420">The Arizona statute involved in Elfbrandt was narrower than Section 5 because it at least applied only to members having knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4514.995" offset="18163336">The Court nevertheless invalidated the statute because it reached members who did not themselves subscribed to this unlawful purpose or engaged in unlawful organizational activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.494" offset="18213386">The government says this case is distinguishable from Elfbrandt because Elfbrandt involves state employment and less grave public interest or a more grave public interest is at stake here in the case of defense facility employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4543.027" offset="18275453">But certainly, some jobs in state governments, to which Section 5 applies are more security sensitive than many of the non-sensitive jobs to which this statute applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4556.634" offset="18329893">To give you only one example, only last week, up in New York, a member of the New York State police who was a minuteman was arrested, a minuteman who used his job in the New York State Police to filter all arsenal weapons for the use of the minuteman.</text>
            <text syncTime="4576.502" offset="18409409">Elfbrandt invalidated the Arizona statute as to all state employment, sensitive or non-sensitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4583.762" offset="18438457">Because as it's stated at page 17 and I quote, “Those who join an organization but do not share its unlawful purposes and who do not participate in its unlawful activities, surely pose no threat either as citizens or public employees.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.633" offset="18509928">Such persons surely pose no threat, these Elfbrandt words as defense employees either.</text>
            <text syncTime="4610.421" offset="18545037">Next, the government argues that Congress had no less drastic means available than the means used in Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="4620.964" offset="18587251">Says, that are being impractical to apply the screening technique of the industrial security program to defense facilities in view of the greater number of employees involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4634.807" offset="18642631">But -- and here's where the three million figure came from Mr. Chief Justice, the government says in its brief that way back as of 1956, 10 years ago, they had already screened three million employees under the industrial security program.</text>
            <text syncTime="4649.764" offset="18702399">And Mr. Maroney said here this morning that he was advised that the defense facilities designated by the Secretary of Defense involved only about 1% of total employment in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4665.131" offset="18763943">Well, if you take the total figure of 70 million that would give us seven million employees of defense facilities of whom three million had already been screened way back in 1956.</text>

            <text syncTime="4688.223" offset="18856312">At one point in his argument Mr. Justice Brennan, he did said that 1% of the number of facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.470" offset="18877210">Mr. Justice Fortas asked him whether wasn't it true that there were great many more employees involved, and Mr. Maroney said, “No, I think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4702.788" offset="18914513">I've been advised by some of the defense department that the ratio is about the same”.</text>
            <text syncTime="4708.609" offset="18937814">Besides which if practicality is a consideration, a more impractical measure than Section 5 would be hard to imagine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4717.295" offset="18972505">Here it is, 16 years after the Act was passed and Section 5 hasn't yet even got off the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="4723.945" offset="18999150">If our security depended on its effectiveness, we would in pretty bad shape here 16 years after the Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.933" offset="19043140">Finally the government says that the Aptheker was distinguishable because there is less risk in permitting Communists to venture abroad than in allowing them access to a defense facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="4746.046" offset="19087548">This argument conveniently overlooks a lured picture of the travel menace that the government painted for the benefit of the Court in the Aptheker case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4755.183" offset="19124120">But more to the point, the government can't cite a single instance in which a Communist employee of a defense facility was even suspected of espionage or sabotage during the whole 16 years that the Act has been on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="4770.634" offset="19185873">And the only instance it cites prior to the passage of the Act is based on the report of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, and as our brief shows has since been completely discredited.</text>
            <text syncTime="4785.336" offset="19244701">The government also relies on the findings of Congress in Section 2 of the Act that Communist-action organizations seek to accomplish their ultimate political objective by espionage, sabotage, and other unlawful means.</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.525" offset="19305514">But this finding is contradicted by the report of a Board which your company that's ordered, that's the Communist party register under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4811.445" offset="19349191">The report reviewed the party's activities at great length for the full period from its organization in 1919 to 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.043" offset="19387538">It found by way of conclusion that the party operates primarily to advance the objectives of the World Communist movement but it doesn't find a single instance of espionage, sabotage or the use of any other unlawful means in this entire period under review and the report says there of any findings of unlawful party advocacy as it is of a finding of any other unlawful activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4850.019" offset="19503417">At most, the Board found that the party advocated violence only as a abstract and therefore protected political doctrine and this Court so viewed the findings in its 1961 decision upholding the registration order.</text>
            <text syncTime="4868.544" offset="19577501">The decisions in the Aptheker and Wieman cases teach that the scienter required to disqualify a person from employment or travel because of membership in a Communist organization has actual knowledge that the organization has an unlawful purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4888.136" offset="19655868">Mere knowledge of the organization has been officially condemned as insufficient for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4894.852" offset="19682826">But even if the rule were otherwise, a member's knowledge of the registration ordered against the Communist Party couldn't supply the necessary scienter since the order was not accompanied by any finding of any unlawful party purpose of party activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4913.222" offset="19756283">A majority of the Court in the 1961 case held that such a finding of unlawful purpose or activity wasn't essential to the validity of the registration order because as Mr. Justice Frankfurter put it in his opinion, registration is a regulatory rather than a prohibitory statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4935.222" offset="19844263">We disagree with that view for the reasons that Chief Justice stated in his dissenting opinion in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.591" offset="19877700">But however that maybe, the section we have here today, Section 5 (a) (1) (D) is clearly prohibitory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4951.215" offset="19908211">As a result under the logic of your 1961 decision, the findings with respect to the Communist Party are insufficient to support the application of Section 5 (a) (1) (D) to members of the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4966.546" offset="19969546">Both the findings of the board and the showing of the government is made in this case demonstrate that the deprivation of liberty imposed by Section 5 of the Act has no real, rational, reasonable relation to the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.351" offset="20036733">Simply another manifestation of what Senator Fullbright has characterized and I quote “As our morbid preoccupation with the danger of Communist subversion, a disease which has proved so costly to our personal freedom and perhaps more important to our national dignity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5006.068" offset="20127640">The lack of any rational basis for the statute leads the government in its brief to justify it as a war measure and to dismiss the lack of any declaration of war against the Soviet Union as a mere technicality.</text>
            <text syncTime="5022.827" offset="20194722">After reading the President's recent speeches on the necessity of improving Soviet-American relations, I can only conclude that there has been breakdown in communications between the White House and the Department of Justice, on this phase of the case and one wonders what might not have been wiser to appoint it under Secretary of State as Attorney General rather than to have made the Attorney General under Secretary of the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="5108.937" offset="20539120">I turn now to the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5112.737" offset="20554271">By punishing members of a radical or political minority for engaging in specified private employment, Section 5 (a) (1) (D) restrains the freedom of political association which the First Amendment protects.</text>
            <text syncTime="5130.321" offset="20624697">The validity of the section must therefore be judged by First Amendment standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="5136.359" offset="20648835">The applicable standard is that the legislation must be narrowly drawn so as not in the words of Scales versus United States and I quote “to cut deeper into the freedom of association and as necessary to deal with the substance of evils that the Congress has a right to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5155.874" offset="20726888">Both the blunderbuss impacts of Section 5 (a) (1) (D) on its face and its application to members of the Communist Party, an organization which has not been found to engage in unlawful activity invalidates the section under this standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.501" offset="20797419">The government's brief argues that Congress was justified in enacting the section in preference to a narrowly drawn screening program because you and I quote, “it has an immediate interim effect and requires no bulky administrative machinery to carry it into practice.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5192.465" offset="20873279">But as this Court has so often held considerations of administrative convenience and efficiency that might be persuasive in other context can never justify the infringement of First Amendment freedoms.</text>
            <text syncTime="5207.541" offset="20933569">And the interim effect of the section, a feature which the government seems to believe to be so desirable and advantageous is enough alone to invalidate the section because as this Court has said and I think it was in NAACP versus Button.</text>
            <text syncTime="5231.029" offset="21027506">These are -- these First Amendment freedoms are delicate and vulnerable and the fact of sanctions is often sufficient to inhibit their exercise even if the sanctions are not applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="5246.979" offset="21091244">The statute's chilling effect on the First Amendment freedoms of all Americans, Communists and non-Communist was depicted by President Truman in his veto message in which he said after reviewing the effect of a statute, the inevitable -- and I quote, “The inevitable tendency would be to express null obvious uncontroversial subjects.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5272.125" offset="21191868">I'd like now to turn to three questions which haven't been touched on the government's brief and only one of which was touched on in request of Mr. Maroney's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5287.685" offset="21254144">The first of these involves a question of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5292.581" offset="21273684">It is that the indictment is defective because it alleges only if the Communist Party has been ordered to register as a Communist-action organization but not that the Communist Party is in fact such an organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5306.230" offset="21328332">And I think Mr. Maroney inadvertently misdescribed the indictment when I was opening remarks and said the indictment charges that the Communist Party is a Communist-action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5315.876" offset="21366888">There is no such allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5317.673" offset="21374098">The only allegation is that it's been harder to register as a Communist-action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5322.894" offset="21394996">His latter allegation that is to say the fact, the allegation that the party is a Communist-action organization was omitted because the government interpret Section 5 (a) (1) (D) as making the registration order against the Communist Party conclusive as to its character for the purposes of a prosecution under the section.</text>
            <text syncTime="5346.262" offset="21488410">This interpretation is contrary to the text of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5350.688" offset="21506173">The introductory clause of Section 5 provides, and I quote, “When a Communist organization” and I interject to say that means under the statute either a Communist action or a Communist front organization, “When a Communist organization is registered or there is in effect a final order requiring such organization to register then it becomes unlawful for the members to do certain things.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5379.259" offset="21620381">Section 5 (a) (1) (D), the subsection of that section which is immediately involved here provides and I quote, “If such organization referring back to a Communist action or Communist fund organization that has been ordered to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="5394.857" offset="21682761">If such organization is a Communist-action organization then it is unlawful for the members to hold defense facility employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5406.210" offset="21728214">I think it's clear from this wording that Section 5 is applicable to the members of an organization which both is a Communist organization or in the case of Section 5 (a) (1) (D), a Communist-action organization and which is either registered or been ordered to register as such an organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5426.161" offset="21808044">In other words, Congress in this section made the existence of the fact and not only of the Board's finding as to the fact an element of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5438.379" offset="21856841">The wording of other criminal provisions of the Act cited in our brief showed that this result was deliberate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5447.497" offset="21893308">Or one of them unlike Section 5 (a) (1) (D) and Section 6 (a) makes the fact as well as the findings an element of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5458.362" offset="21936776">Others like Section 6 (b) of the act, Section 10, Section 15 (a) clearly predicates the criminal liability only on the existence of a registration order and the finding by the board that the organization is that a Communist organization and not on its actual character.</text>
            <text syncTime="5477.446" offset="22013158">The construction of Section 5 in accordance with its text as I've indicated it is required by the rule of strict construction of criminal statutes and as compelled, we think by three constitutional considerations that I'd like to indicate very briefly here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5496.100" offset="22087764">First, the government's construction of the section denies appellee procedural due process because it precludes him from challenging in the criminal proceedings the validity of the Board's 1953 determination that the Communist Party was a Communist-action organization, a determination made in a proceeding to which it was not a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="5518.856" offset="22178774">Moreover, even if it could be said that the appellee is bound by the Board's determination taken in his absence could still be entitled to litigate the current character of the organization or the current validity of the Board's determination which is now 13 years old and as the Chief Justice pointed out in his dissenting opinion in the 1961 case is based on evidence that's far more than 13 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="5551.574" offset="22309700">We -- our position is that the appellee is not accorded due process by Section 13 of the Act which permits a registered organization to apply periodically to the board for a redetermination of the status.</text>
            <text syncTime="5568.169" offset="22376051">In the first place, this procedural is available only to organizations and not to individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5573.764" offset="22398412">Therefore, it's not available to the appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5576.685" offset="22410115">Furthermore, it's not available to the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="5579.911" offset="22422967">Because under Section 13, an organization must first register in a Communist-action organization before it can apply to the Board for a redetermination of its status.</text>
            <text syncTime="5592.608" offset="22473853">Now, the Communist Party hasn't registered under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5596.443" offset="22489109">It's still litigating the constitutionality of enforcement of that provision against it under the questions that are litigating the questions which is quite held premature in the 1961 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5614.308" offset="22560580">Obviously, it's got a right, a constitutional right to have those questions determined and the appellee can't be denied these constitutional rights because the Communist party is asserting its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="5628.221" offset="22616273">The government's interpretation of the section would also invalidate it as a bill of attainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="5633.737" offset="22638320">In the 1961 case, a majority of the Court held that the Act's registration requirement didn't obtain the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5643.043" offset="22675519">This conclusion was based on the few that Section 13 would permit the party to secure a periodically determination of its status and hence that observance of the obligations, have registration and impales is made to turn on what the Court in its opinion called and I quote, “Continuously contemporaneous fact in this effect.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5667.903" offset="22774993">But as I have shown the party can't secure a redetermination of its status so long as it resists the effort to enforce the registration requirement against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5679.808" offset="22822640">Nor paradoxically will that ever be able to secure a redetermination of it's status, if it's successful in the pending litigation and the registration order is found to be constitutionally unenforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5694.848" offset="22882722">In any event, a Section 13 proceeding isn't available to the appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5700.213" offset="22904247">Under the government's interpretation of the statute therefore which doesn't give the appellee to the right to contest the validity of the determination on the criminal trial, he has no possible escape from the effect of a Board's determination that the Communist Party is a Communist-action organization even if that determination no longer has any validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5725.426" offset="23005080">His position that is the appellee's position today is exactly the same as all of the Communist Party has been named in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5733.419" offset="23037053">The Board's determination that the Communist Party isn't a Communist-action organization, it has that effect as to him and that being so the statute as the government would interpret is invalid under the Court's decision in United States versus Brown.</text>

            <text syncTime="6472.300" offset="25992547">We say that the section is unconstitutional as applied because the registration order against the Communist Party has been invalidated by facts of which this Court can and should take judicial notice showing at the world Communist movement described in Section 2 doesn't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="6492.241" offset="26072377">By definition there can't be a Communist-action organization unless there's a World Communist Movement that meets the Section 2 description.</text>
            <text syncTime="6502.020" offset="26111457">This is so because the definition of a Communist-action organization is tied in with the findings of Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="6508.531" offset="26137475">Section 33 defines a Communist-action organization as an organization which is controlled by the foreign government controlling the World Communist Movement described in Section 2 and which operates to advance the objectives of the movement described in Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="6525.972" offset="26207274">Section 2 finds that there exists a World Communist Movement made up of Communist-action organizations which are not free and independent but are national sections of the World Communist Movement and are controlled by and subject to the discipline of the Communist dictatorship of an unnamed foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="6545.918" offset="26287000">The Board found that this country was the Soviet Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="6549.605" offset="26301837">Now on affirming the Board's order against the Communist Party, the Court in its 1961 decision held that the characteristics of the World Communist Movement and the source of its control as found in Section 2 are not subject to proof or disproof in the registration proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="6569.736" offset="26382294">It regarded the finding of the Board that the Soviet Union was the unnamed foreign power referred to in Section 2 as a matter of law - question of law, a matter of statutory construction which it affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6583.696" offset="26438196">The Court recognized that a change in the world situation would invalidate this construction and that the time might come when in its words and I quote, “The board or a reviewing court will be able to say that the World Communist Movement as Congress meant in the term in 1950 no longer exists.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6604.630" offset="26521893">Well, as Mr. Justice Fortas's question implies, the future world situation which the opinion envisaged has materialized.</text>
            <text syncTime="6615.611" offset="26565778">Whatever may have been said about the Section 2 findings in 1950 when they were made, the description of Communism as a monolithic world movement under iron Soviet control dedicated to the overthrow of all free governments by a criminal means applies in the face of the facts of contemporary political life as everybody knows.</text>
            <text syncTime="6639.829" offset="26662640">Yet for the reasons that I've indicated, neither the appellee nor the Communist Party can secure Board consideration of these facts nor could the appellee litigate the issue in this criminal trial since the Court in the 1961 case held the issue as one of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6659.495" offset="26741321">Accordingly, it's incumbent on the Court, this Court, to take judicial notice of the self-evident fact that in the words of your 1961 decision, “The World Communist Movement as Congress meant to term in 1950 no longer exists.”</text>

            <text syncTime="6838.764" offset="27458435">The five categories that we were quoting this morning were from the Defense Department's release that was made at the time these listings were placed into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6854.444" offset="27521128">The similar criteria, frankly identical criteria which were before Congress are set forth at pages 443, 444 of the hearings on HR 9753 which is quoted in our brief -- cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6872.379" offset="27592913">There are very slight changes of a few phrases</text>
            <text syncTime="6875.973" offset="27607228">For example, the first criteria stated to Congress was top secret projects, facilities engaged in top secret projects and then it was explained that that was meant to include top secret, secret and class -- and confidential which is the same really as important classified military projects.</text>

            <text syncTime="6946.359" offset="27888828">We think it's quite clear that Congress did intend the statute have an interim effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6954.218" offset="27920280">The purpose of course was to get these people who insisted on remaining members of the Communist-dominated, foreign-dominated group out of these places where in an emergency situation that they could do substantial damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="6974.453" offset="28001155">If the alternative suggested were adopted, the person who is then a member of an organization such as this could merely continue his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6983.821" offset="28038666">It could be that he would never be found out and he would have nothing to lose by doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="6989.480" offset="28061341">This way, Congress really puts him to making a choice of either remaining in the organization or giving up his defense employment for the purpose of getting him out there if he is going to remain associated with the organization.</text>
