            <text syncTime="6.208" offset="128188">This is a federal estate tax case involving the marital deduction and is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit thus a bequest of property in trust for the benefit of the surviving widow who is to receive a fixed dollar monthly payment out of income in corpus, and he was given a general power of appointment to qualify for the marital deduction where an actuarial table is utilized to determine the value of the specific portion of the cost property within the meaning of Section 2056 (b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, “The will of the decedent bequeath and devise one half of the residue in trust.”</text>
            <text syncTime="57.689" offset="334137">The trustee was directed to pay the widow out of income and corpus the sum of $300 a month until the youngest child reached 18 and $350 a month thereafter for life.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.425" offset="401115">The widow was given a general power of appointment to appoint the -- by will the principle remaining at the time of her death.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="82.692" offset="434134">The entire amount?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="milton_i_baldinger" startTime="83.975" stopTime="652.253">
            <label>Mr. Milton I. Baldinger</label>
            <text syncTime="83.975" offset="439254">Yes, Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.287" offset="448554">The District Court decided that notwithstanding the fact that the corpus was unable up, to the time of the hearing, to produce income of $300 a month, the marital deduction would not be available since income from the trust could have exceeded $300 a month and the surplus would then be required to be accumulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.867" offset="542804">Since the surviving spouse was not specifically entitled to all of the income of the trust corpus, the District Court reasoned that the marital deduction should not be allowed on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.813" offset="590660">But then the District Court moved on to say since they were assuming that the trust could generate more than $300 income that they would apply an actuarial table to determine what the present value of the $300 a month would be and thus could carve out of the trust corpus that part which it would label a specific portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.516" offset="677386">And as to that, the District Court did allow the marital deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.175" offset="700061">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, five to three, reversed the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.663" offset="722004">The Third Circuit majority ruled that the value of the specific portion from which the widow would be entitled to all of the income for life was not acceptably computed.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.783" offset="770487">Nextly, the Court of Appeals, in the number of reasons given, misinterprets the will as we have emphasized in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.618" offset="805804">The statute is silent on the definition of specific portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.644" offset="829942">The Commissioner of the Treasury has adopted regulations wherein it indicates that the specific portion should be stated in a fractional or percentile.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.196" offset="892113">The courts have cast doubt on the regulations or have considered these regulations invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.747" offset="922311">The Third Circuit majority itself cast out upon the regulation because it doesn't adopt it.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.390" offset="948955">It finds that it does unnecessary to determine the validity or invalidity.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.481" offset="969331">The Second Circuit in Gelb, in 298 F.2d clearly takes the position that the regulations are invalid when insisting that the specific portion be a fractional or percentile of the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.723" offset="1038294">In that case, we had the widow entitled to the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.377" offset="1060864">But, there was a child who was entitled under the trust, if the Trustee so determined, to -- up to $5,000 a year for education or maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.899" offset="1111019">The Second Circuit took the position that the value of that $5,000 determined by actuarial tables could be carved out of the trust corpus and the balance therefore could be eligible for the marital deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.115" offset="1171832">The Seventh Circuit in Citizens National Bank of Evansville, 221, in -- which is now No. 1 -- 488 in this Court on a pending petition for writ of certiorari likewise ruled that the regulations were invalid in a case very similar to the one at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.122" offset="1255842">When Congress put the marital deduction section on the books, it is stated in the hearings and even in this Stapf that equalization between common-law citizens and community property citizens was designed.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.201" offset="1332224">I would prefer to suggest that what Congress was aiming for was to cut down the discriminatory gap between decedent's estates of community property states and citizens of the common-law states because we cannot really have two equalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.186" offset="1412159">Only in the classic case where the husband owns the family assets and dies first and following the rules of the road can we have this equalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.269" offset="1464404">In various other situations, one Paul Anderson writing in 54 Michigan Law Review at 1087 points out a number of postulates where there will be substantial inequality between the two property systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.656" offset="1542040">There is no doubt that in a community property state, the spouses own one half of the community property.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.696" offset="1566177">However, we submit that Congress permits in a common-law state a marital deduction if the wife is given a life estate and a power of appointment to her estate or to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.359" offset="1616854">We realize that if a widow only has a life estate with a remainder over to others that such would not qualify for the marital deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.616" offset="1661785">We maintained that a widow, who is entitled to receive $300 a month out of income in corpus and later $350 a month for her life and has the power to appoint to her state or to others, has the key incidence of ownership within the framework of this type of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.500" offset="1745377">We don't have to prove that she has the equivalent to the fee simple because Congress recognizes that she would have a fee simple where she has a life estate with a power to appoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.624" offset="1801906">We maintain that nowhere that Congress adopt a policy of value fluctuations on which the Government lays the foundation of its regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.575" offset="1845687">The Second Circuit in Gelb finds no basis for such.But even if that were in Congress' mind at that time, we say in the case at bar, if the value of the corpus increases; it will be includible in the gross estate of this widow when she passes away.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.569" offset="1929697">Now, actuarial tables have been used on many occasions in determining valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.562" offset="1961671">The Government stresses that in this particular case have we used a capitalization approach we would have had a value in excess of the trust corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.125" offset="1999914">And we take the position that so long as the carving out process takes the lesser, whether it be the capitalization method or the annuity method that that is the amount which should be allowed for the marital deduction and not the hypothetical excess case.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.560" offset="2073579">But we also feel that maybe it proves too much from the Government's point of view and that is if it will take more money to give this widow $300 a month out of income in corpus, then it should follow that she is getting all of the income from the corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.448" offset="2145155">In other words, if this widow is going to be getting $300 a month out of which they have to dipping into the corpus, then it follows that she is getting all of the income of that particular corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.383" offset="2200952">If we move on and say that the $300 will be at least the amount of income, then we know she's getting all of the income from the trust corpus because the balance there or the excess is being accumulated and will be taxable in her estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.879" offset="2270856">Consequently, we take the position that if the $300 is computed, the present value is computed on an actuarial basis that the correct amount will be carved out of the trust corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.344" offset="2328743">The Third Circuit erred, we respectfully submit, in reading the will of this decedent in such a manner as to destroy the marital deduction, and we respectfully submit to the Government's brief, does not even attempt to support the reasoning of the Third Circuit majority opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.768" offset="2410454">For example, the Third Circuit majority opinion took the position that there would be a fund dissolution if we used the annuity basis of actuarial tables of carving out and then says that the testator could not be contemplated.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.116" offset="2479835">We stressed in our brief that the testator said, “Out of income and corpus,” and then went on to say, “The principle remaining at the time of death,” which indicates to us that the testator could have contemplated dipping into the corpus, number one, but also a dissipation.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.359" offset="2560815">Nextly, the Third Circuit opinion stresses the spendthrift trust clauses in the will and even the regulations of the Commissioner of the Treasury clearly provide that such spendthrift trust clauses will not inhibit the marital deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.919" offset="2631032">And nextly, there was stress made upon the time of the death as being the wrong time to determine the valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.165" offset="2668022">And we know that that is the only time that we have to determine the valuation for marital deduction purposes in order to carve out the thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="936.522" offset="3849488">This case turns on whether decedents bequest to his widow a fixed monthly payments from a variable yield of trust constituted the bequest of all the income from a specific portion of the trust as Section 2056 (b) (5) requires if that bequest is to qualify for the marital deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.567" offset="3937677">The key words, we here submit, are all of the income from the specific portion must be given to the widow if the bequest to her is to qualify for the marital deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.109" offset="3987832">The legislative history and the purpose of Section 2056 (b) (5) make it clear that Congress has required that the widow be given all the income from a specific portion or trust property in order to insure that she will have the rights of a virtual owner in that portion, in order to insure that her income will rise and fall with the actual income generated by the trust property, just as owners would.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.019" offset="4091486">The widow must receive the rights of a virtual owner because it follows from Congress' intent to achieve estate tax equality between common-law and community property states that a bequest of trust income to a widow in a common-law state should not be tax-exempt unless the widow receives rights equivalent to those enjoyed by a spouse in a community property state in her share of the community property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.319" offset="4204648">Now, the petitioner here argues that since the value of the widow's right to receive fixed payments can be estimated through an annuity computation based on various arbitrary assumptions, that estimated value that can be considered a qualifying specific portion under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.262" offset="4284374">We submit that whether a bequest in trust qualifies under Section 2056(b) (5) turns not on whether the widow's interest can be valued but on whether the widow has been given the right's equivalent to virtual ownership that are specified in Section 2056(b) (5) including the right to receive all of the income from a most specific portion of the trust property during her lifetime.</text>

            <text syncTime="2173.740" offset="8798333">Congress recognized that the bequest in trust are used very often in common law states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.095" offset="8819754">So Congress provided that if the widow is given, under a trust instrument, all of the income from the trust corpus during her lifetime and the general power of appointment over the entire corpus, the bequest would qualify because the widow had two-key characteristics of virtual ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.773" offset="8890493">Her income would necessarily rise and fall with the income generator by the trust property during her lifetime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.918" offset="8915048">And the value of the property subject to her power of appointment would rise and fall with changes in value of the underlying trust assets.</text>
