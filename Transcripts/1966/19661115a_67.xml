            <label>Mr. John T. McTernan</label>
            <text syncTime="23.895" offset="198928">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.546" offset="217527">Petitioner Travis here stands convicted on two counts, the violation of Title 8, U.S. Code Section 1185 for having deported, the United States for Cuba on two occasions in 1962 without a valid a passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.414" offset="288998">The proof by stipulation was that on neither occasion, the petitioner have and I quote, "A valid United States passport specifically endorsed for travel to Cuba."</text>
            <text syncTime="61.607" offset="349811">There is no proof in this record at all as to whether petitioner had an otherwise operative passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.141" offset="383979">So the evidence shows that she went to Cuba to observe the living and working conditions of the people and the effectuation and implementation of Government programs dealing with health, public health, housing, education, agriculture industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.124" offset="455868">The fact are then in the record that she did so observed and take photographs, represented a copies of which in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.142" offset="487946">And upon her return, she reported upon her observations by way of circular letters to people in this country and by illustrated lectures.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.009" offset="535385">And I assume from the decisions in (Inaudible) that this Court is familiar with the statutory editing in Section 1185 and I will not go into that detail unless I'm asked to sufficing to say that 1185 replaced two earlier statutes which in pertinent respects here were identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.336" offset="620753">There were prior to the 1952 enactment of Section 1185 regulations issued by the Secretary of State and which were adopted by the President after the 1952 statute passed in Proclamation Number 3004 which is set forth on our -- in the appendix to our brief, Appendix F.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.500" offset="733393">And these regulations provided that passports would not be required for countries in the western hemisphere.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.069" offset="775607">In 1961, the so-called excluding Cuba Amendment was adopted, and this as we see it is a three faceted Government Act which involved a regulation, a public notice and a press release.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.558" offset="849586">The regulation is set forth at Appendix B of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.618" offset="865886">It states in terms that it is promulgated under an executive order which in turn was based upon 22 U.S.C.211 (a) is the statute involved in the Zemel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.157" offset="916041">It does not say that it was promulgated under Section 1185.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.825" offset="938715">And the effect of it was to exclude Cuba from the exemption in the earlier regulations pertaining to countries in the western hemisphere.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.341" offset="972779">So that by the face of the regulation alone, taking it by itself, a passport was required in the case of a departure for Cuba just as it were had been required for a departure for France, or Burma, or Cuba and whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.578" offset="1041638">There was nothing in the regulation on itself which required a special endorsement to the passport for Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.900" offset="1078941">Simultaneously, with the promulgation of the amendment was the issuance of the public notice that is set forth in Appendix D to our brief, which declared existing passports invalid for Cuba and provided for the future that passports not be valid for travel to Cuba unless especially endorsed for such travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.528" offset="1173504">The third process of the Government Act at this time was the simultaneous press relief, which explained the Government's action is the result of the Government's inability and I quote, "to extend a normal protective servicing to Americans traveling in -- or visiting in Cuba."</text>
            <text syncTime="288.209" offset="1256260">It advised that the specially required endorsement for passports to Cuba would be granted only to persons, "Whose travel maybe regarded as in the best interest of the United States."</text>
            <text syncTime="304.144" offset="1319999">We take the position in this litigation, if the Court please that the regulations, the public notice and the press release are an integrated scheme to regulate travel by -- to Cuba by way of license to be issued in a total discretion of the Secretary of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.463" offset="1409233">Now, I would like to address myself to our first position namely that the statute does not authorize the imposition of criminal sanctions to enforce area travel ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.821" offset="1470673">On its face of the statute and I now refer to Section 1185, imposes a requirement that citizens hold a valid passports at the time they cross U.S. borders and that is as far as the statute goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.534" offset="1537546">The face of the statute contains no reference to the destination of it's -- of the traveler and imposes no requirement and no sanctions related to the destination of the traveler.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.683" offset="1598151">As applied here, the Government would read the statute as permitting the use of a passport requirement with a purpose of prohibiting travel to areas declared out of bounds by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.351" offset="1652799">And the issue as we see it is whether the statute is to be construed as we think it is written, simply a border control regulation or whether is it be construed as we think the Government would construe it as a travel to regulation, which imposes prohibitions and licenses and dependent upon the destination of the traveler.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.403" offset="1768991">Our position rests on three grounds if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.343" offset="1788740">First on the face of the statute which is I've already pointed out, speaks only to holding a passport when the border is crossed and without any reference to destination at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.111" offset="1843806">The second point of our position here is that the legislative history of the statute discloses a purpose to impose surveillance and control over border crossing specifically and articulately directed to security consideration such as spies, saboteurs and fugitives in justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.963" offset="1935235">And as our legislative history shows, the sponsor of the legislation as one of it -- the other three stages at which it was enacted specifically said that it was not directed and I quote again, "it's the legitimate travel of United States citizen."</text>
            <text syncTime="475.161" offset="2003989">The third ground of our position here is that the history of area restrictions as developed by administrative interpretation and application shows that these restrictions has been consistently regarded as unrelated to the command of Section 1185 as not armed if you will by the sanctions of Section 1185.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.788" offset="2102523">I said consistently, consistently that is until after and I repeat, after the Excluding Cuba regulations was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.170" offset="2148080">Now, it appears in the Government's brief that it concedes our position concerning the face of the statute and it concedes our position concerning the legislative history and I do not discuss this here unless the Court have direct questions to me about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.504" offset="2209416">As I read the Government's brief, it fact -- in fact, it does not deny the facts that we present on administrative construction, although, it would draw from different inferences from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.912" offset="2266990">Concerning administrative construction, I think it's important to observe the dual function of a passport is delineated by this Court in Kent against Dulles.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.319" offset="2304606">There, the court spoke first the function of the passport as a request directed to foreign government for the safe passage of the traveler and secondly, as a means of exit control.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.859" offset="2362807">We think that the history of area restrictions developed by the administrative action of the Department of State has always and explicitly acted with reference to the request for safe passage function alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.901" offset="2426964">Without going into the details of the administrative construction which is set out in our brief, let me summarize it briefly if I may in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.961" offset="2467192">We have presented there all area restrictions which are researched to disclose which were adopted by the department at the time when Section 1185 or one of its identical predecessors was in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.701" offset="2534170">And none of those instances invokes or is related in any way or warns about the sanctions of 1185.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.325" offset="2584639">They are all accounts in request for safe passage terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.224" offset="2604283">There is no reference to or warning about a criminal penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.875" offset="2622882">And this if the Court please, this includes three such instances which occurred after the enactment of the current legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.877" offset="2666872">And I would draw your attention particularly -- although, certainly not exclusively to the 1918 instance which is discussed in our brief, because the Government pays so much attention to what it was doing at the time the original 1918 statute was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.970" offset="2743254">Where the Government had to practice at that time, the department had to practice at that time, of saying where -- to what areas the passport was good for but they -- and one of the areas where it was suppose to be not good was Germany at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.786" offset="2818487">But the Department's explanatory statement said that this doesn't mean that the traveler couldn't go to Germany, it meant that he had to go there on his own responsibility and at his own risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.763" offset="2866448">And then as consistently thereafter, the Government was talking not in terms of a prohibition enforced by criminal sanction but in terms of requesting safe passage.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.189" offset="2920155">Now two instances, both of them after the current statute was passed, require a little more attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.107" offset="2951816">In 1952, the Department of State passed a so-called ban on travel to communist countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.835" offset="2986715">It declared that these passports would not be validated for a certain named communist countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.283" offset="3012524">In its explanatory statement at that time, it is said that the Department emphasizes, this is its own words that this action in no way forbid that also as it claims, travel to these countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.030" offset="3075532">It said that it contemplated that the traveler would inquire of the Government what conditions were in the countries to which he intended to go and if the normal protective or satisfactory protective arrangements existed the travel would be authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.927" offset="3159124">We say, if the Court please, that this is in effect a disclaimer that the court -- the -- that area restrictions were being issued with criminal sanctions to enforce them.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.486" offset="3209279">And indeed, so did the Association of the Bar of the City of New York which termed it an honest admission that the Department lacked criminal powers to enforce area restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.286" offset="3260479">More clear and more explicit by way of disclaimer of criminal sanction is the 1957 incident referred to in our brief where the able chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee directed this question to the Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.349" offset="3320769">What does it mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="805.166" offset="3324008">He said.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.617" offset="3329860">If a passport is stamped not valid for travel to country X and the holder of the passport goes to country X.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.085" offset="3359744">Is he violating the criminal law?</text>
            <text syncTime="816.939" offset="3371133">And the Department asked for a time to study that question and it took two months to study it and then submitted a written reply in which it said, not necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.059" offset="3411571">And then went on to illustrate its meaning by saying that peripheral to the travel itself, there might be criminal risks for the traveler because if he went to such a country, currency exchanges might involve even trading with the Enemy Act Violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.805" offset="3470608">Or he might not be able to get a passport in the future or he might be involved in false statement accusations growing out of his application for the passport that he was using.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.055" offset="3511568">But nowhere, the Court please, nowhere did the court say that kind of travel would violate Section 1185.</text>

            <text syncTime="1494.186" offset="6080136">It simply says that she didn't have a valid passport specifically endorsed for a travel to Cuba which is what the Department's regulations called for to go to Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.992" offset="6123290">In other words, she didn't hold this special license which the Government has said in 1961, it was going to require people going to Cuba.</text>

            <text syncTime="1531.488" offset="6229347">They asked for an amendment of the law which would provide the criminal penalties for persons who go to places which the Department had said they shouldn't go to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.198" offset="6280129">There is also in the administrative interpretation a fact found by District Judge Zavatt in the Laub case which is companion to this one, that notwithstanding six -- approximately 600 known violations of its area of restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.486" offset="6353272">The Government had failed to prosecute any until it be -- it began a worthy prosecution which did not get to this Court, the Laub prosecution and the Travis prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1694.273" offset="6880423">Now, as I apprehend the Government's position in its answer to our position, that is that one must combine Section 1185 with Section 1101 (a) 30 which contains a definition of passport and include as one of the elements of the definition that would be valid for entry of the bearer into a foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.782" offset="6978539">And the Government's position is that that definition imports into the word valid and it is used in 1185, validity in terms of being addressed to the countries to which the traveler was destined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.120" offset="7051891">We say in the first place that the definition valid for entry of the bearer into a foreign country is a generic definition and doesn't refer to any particular country and not to the country that the traveler intends to go to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.078" offset="7115734">This is simply an effort to define in general term a passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.373" offset="7132871">But more important, if the logic of the Government's position were to be followed, it results in precisely the opposite of everything it has done in over 40 years of administering this or the anti Cuban statutes, because the Government says, "If it endorses the passport not valid for travel to country X departing the United States for country X with an otherwise operative passport is a crime under Section 1185."</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.227" offset="7264319">And this, the Government says, "Only because its policies and practices from 1918 on were geographically restricted,"if I may use its term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.501" offset="7309354">And therefore because it was geographically restricted, Congress they say must have incorporated this standard of validity into the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.490" offset="7345298">But as I have already pointed out, this lies in the face of over 40 years of administrative interpretation to the contrary in which every area restriction issued while this legislation was on the statute books and where criminal sanctions were available as not been -- as not invoked to criminal sanctions, had not referred to the criminal sanctions, and have not sought reinforcement from the criminal sanctions.--</text>

            <text syncTime="1841.517" offset="7469432">Well, its -- the first statute was enacted in 1918.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.293" offset="7488554">It was valid or in if -- it was operative only for about three years until 1921.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.855" offset="7506840">It expired within the World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.743" offset="7518333">Then it was in -- substantially almost identical or reenacted in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.228" offset="7544247">That statute was continued in effect by a series of joint resolution to the Congress until the 1952 statute was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.661" offset="7577997">So when I say 40 years, I don't mean that there was a consistent factor all those 40 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.417" offset="7601089">What I'm saying is that over a 40 year span of time while intermittently this Congress -- this statute was in effect in about 20 years in there when it was not in effect at all and the issue of course wasn't before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.798" offset="7658559">But in that 40-year period beginning in 1918, when there was this statutory language on the books all area restrictions were not couched in criminal terms but were couched in safe passage terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.822" offset="7714670">And as I have pointed out, there have been instances at least two of them when the Government specifically disclaims that its geographic restrictions have violated Section 1185.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.552" offset="7773602">Therefore we say that if one is to infer the intent of Congress from the administrative practices that co-existed with the enactment and the life of the statute one must conclude that the Congress did not intend 1185 to incorporate prohibitions on travel to designated area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.366" offset="7876838">On this question of what is a valid passport, if the Court please, the District Court in Laub and I think largely, if not exclusively on the basis of a the Department of State Handbook which my Brother Boudin cites in his brief in the Laub case, says that valid means issued by the Secretary of the State, countersigned by the traveler and unexpired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.176" offset="7984044">Now, we submit that this history based to the statute, the legislative history of the statute, the history of administrative interpretation, permits one and only -- one of two and only one of two conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.506" offset="8049351">First, that if conclusively negatives a congressional intent to include in Section 1185 criminal punishment for violation of area restriction and this I think is a soundly supported conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.335" offset="8104730">The second conclusion is that this history read in the light of obligatory canons, a statutory construction leaves substantial doubt as to the congressional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.754" offset="8154363">And the obligatory canon, we submit are strict construction, strict construction not simply because this is a criminal statute but certainly because it is a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.791" offset="8202533">But also strict construction because it impinges upon constitutionally protected liberty and on liberties closely related to the First Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.674" offset="8254046">And under the second alternative, if there is as we say there is substantial and abiding doubt of the congressional purpose then there is no clear statutory command of the kind which the Government asserts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.588" offset="8321755">I would like to address myself to due process vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.362" offset="8348818">I think that our argument on congressional intent shows the vagueness and ambiguity concerning the very existence of the statutory command for violation of which petitioner here stands convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.667" offset="8410049">We submit that the understanding of the common world to paraphrase Mr. Justice Holmes in the McBoyle case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.808" offset="8438575">Even when aided by a reasonably intelligent lawyer could not know with reasonable certainly that the conduct here punished was in fact forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.362" offset="8476818">Again, I call the Court's attention to the statement by the Bar Association of the City of New York that the 1952 statement of the department that it's -- that its area restrictions on travel to the communist countries in no way forbids such travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.739" offset="8546304">It is an honest admission of the statutory basis for criminal prosecution does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.746" offset="8570337">But I think that there is an addition to the vagueness concerning the existence of the statutory command, a vagueness which appears from the three faceted act of the Government in trying to license travel to Cuba in January 16, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.112" offset="8651839">I referred to a press release which was simultaneously the promulgation of a regulations and the public notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.176" offset="8680051">It speaks in safe conduct terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.648" offset="8693948">It says -- it explains its action as the result of the Government's inability to extend normal protective services to American visiting Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.138" offset="8731878">There is no reference in that press release the criminal penalty and if there was anywhere that the Government trying advice its people as to whether they expect them to do when refrain from doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2253.345" offset="9116714">Now the second aspect of this Act of January 16, 1961 was the public notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.797" offset="9146598">This is somewhat less clear about speaking and request to say passage term but it does refer to the Secretary's authority and it recites only Section 211 (a), not Section 1185.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.183" offset="9208142">And again, nothing is said concerning criminal penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.026" offset="9231444">The regulation itself recites that it was promulgated under Section 211 (a) that of course is the civil passport power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.616" offset="9261850">There are no criminal penalties enforcing Section 211 (a) a regulation issued under.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.238" offset="9288286">There is no warning in this regulation concerning criminal penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.500" offset="9313364">There is an obscure and Delphic reference to Section 1185 not in the body of the regulation but in parenthetical material following which I see and there are number of citations including that to 1185.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.648" offset="9385984">If that reference stands just as I have described it, no explanatory words, nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.828" offset="9414719">It's ambiguity is heightened by the facts that the regulations which it purport to amend that is 22 CFR 53.2 - 53.3 were originally promulgated -- adopted by the President in 1952 after 1185 had been passed when in proclamation 3004 which is in our Appendix E, adopted the regulations of the Secretary to that effect which had pre-existed the 1952 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.949" offset="9555153">Now, if the Court please, if on the promulgation date, January 16, 1961, the Department intended the criminal consequences for violation of this regulation which the Government asserted in indicting petitioner two and a half years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.514" offset="9621400">The time and the place to had said so was in at least one of this elaborate array of press release, public notice and regulation which attended the Excluding Cuba regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.932" offset="9675107">And this, the more so because an unbroken line of administrative interpretation beginning in 1918 had never invoked such sanctions, even though the statute was available and on at least two occasions, the Government had explicitly disclaimed such sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.117" offset="9747832">In these lights, elemental standards demanded fair warning of the conduct proscribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.597" offset="9773746">I find in these facts a striking parallel to those involved in the Bowie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.447" offset="9797151">That is, if will you recall as one of those sit-In cases where people were charged with having violated the statute which made it a crime to enter private property after warning not to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.205" offset="9848142">They had entered without such a warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.563" offset="9857651">They remained and were asked to leave and they were prosecuted for violating the statute because they failed to leave after being requested to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.487" offset="9901328">I find the striking parallel between the facts of this case and those in the Krauss Brothers' case which is an OPA Regulation case in which the Government sought to prosecute a wholesale butcher for a tying agreement when he requires his purchasers to buy a certain meat products in addition to those they contracted for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.621" offset="9985860">And this Court found that while the price administrator had the authority to prohibit any tying agreement it was not clear from these regulations that he had prohibited a tying agreement involving commodities having valued where they were sold for value or for resealing price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.807" offset="10074572">Somewhat apposite here, I think quite apposite here is the Mersky case also cited in our in our brief where an importer of violins in Germany changed the country of origin label after leaving the label intact to satisfy the tariff regulations and the tariff collection requirement and they changed it to -- from a -- labeled it -- said they were made in East Germany to a label that made in Germany where the regulation -- through the separate regulation dealing with consumer protection and his change label satisfied the consumer protection regulation and the Government at that point tried to invoke the tariff regulation against this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.786" offset="10258474">In each of these cases as in here -- as in this case, there has been no fair warning of the conduct proscribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.418" offset="10301001">Now, the court below disposed of our fair notice position by pointing to the stipulation of facts that petitioner knew the provisions of Section 1185 and knew the provisions of 22 CFR 53.2 and 53.3.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.286" offset="10392534">Our answer to that is two quotes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.894" offset="10406954">First, that knowledge of these provisions is not tantamount to awareness of their legal effects and it is not tantamount to an ability to resolve the ambiguity which the regulations and the departmental practices are created.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.984" offset="10479261">In any event, and this gets as close to the problems of Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Brennan were asking me about a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.621" offset="10509876">Knowledge of 22 CFR 53.2 and 53.3 would apprise the reader only that from January 16, 1961 on, a passport was required for travel to Cuba, a passport just like it was traveling required for France or Burma or wherever you want to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.820" offset="10594617">But it would not disclose that a traveler had to have a special license to go to Cuba which the public notice and the press release told about.</text>

            <text syncTime="2652.475" offset="10713318">The public notice goes into the Federal Register and the press release goes to the newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.151" offset="10732022">And the traveler trying to find out what he is required to do then goes from the statute to CFR, perhaps she sees the Federal Register and if the newspapers in his town carries a press release, he might see that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.609" offset="10801821">All she could see was the thing that you've pointed out to me a moment ago which of course is in the case that by looking at the regulation, she would see that she needed a passport, a passport to Cuba just as you had needed the passport for France.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.788" offset="10870575">And as I've said before there is nothing in this record which proves that she violated that regulation so drawn if the negative pregnant operate, it operates against the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3667.481" offset="14773269">This case and the one immediately following it, concern the meaning and constitutionality of Section 215 (b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 which Mr. McTernan has been referring to as Section 1185 because it's that so numbered in Title 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.967" offset="14851218">That provision was first enacted in World War I in 1918, reenacted with a slight modification just prior to our entering into World War II and took its present form at the time of the Korean War.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.352" offset="14920808">Section 215 (b) in pertinent part makes it a criminal offense and I quote, "When the United States is at war or during the existence of any national emergency proclaimed by the President after the President has also proclaimed that additional restrictions on departure or entry are needed for any citizen of the United States."</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.985" offset="15015267">And here again I quote, "To depart from the United States unless he bears a valid passport."</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.034" offset="15047555">The statute provides that this prohibition is to apply, "except as otherwise provided by the President and subject to such limitations and exceptions as the President may authorize and prescribed."</text>

            <text syncTime="5176.667" offset="20810062">And it was passed through the Congress that had knowledge of this kind of restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5179.993" offset="20823333">And that's why we think that the restrictions are relevant because when Congress said, a pass -- you must -- you may not depart the United States without a valid a passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="5187.862" offset="20854784">We submit it had knowledge of this practice of the Department of State and that it was in effect incorporating those kinds of standards of validity into the statute which it passed.</text>

            <text syncTime="5355.259" offset="21524459">Well, the assurance is that were given at the time though, we submit, were indicated that the President would have the authority by the exception provisions of Section 1185 to accept Canada from the reach of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5373.730" offset="21598333">Well, to that extent Mr. Justice Fortas, we submit that this was an indication that this is not merely a border control statute because specifically what the Congress was focusing on was whether people would be able to go to Canada and whether the President would be able to make exceptions for travel to Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="5391.989" offset="21671372">Now if as petitioner contends and as the defendants in Laub contend, this -- the statute were merely a border control measure and the only thing that the Congress was interested in was in having some way in which the Secretary of State could pass on who was going in and out of the United States at that time then it would not have made much sense to talk in terms of an exemption for -- to travel to a particular country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5420.979" offset="21787251">That indicates that what Congress did have in mind and what it did contemplate and what it knew about was that the President would be or the Secretary of State would be dealing with the destinations of travelers in his regulations as well as with who was permitted to cross the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="5439.417" offset="21861021">Specific reference, we think to the broad power concurred on the President and the Secretary, appears for example on page 3 of the House Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="5453.087" offset="21915669">That report says and I quote, "It is essential to meet the situation that the executive should have wide discretion and wide authority of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5461.306" offset="21948583">No one can foresee the different means which may be adopted by hostile nations to secure military information or spread propaganda and discontent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5469.640" offset="21981915">Now of course again, Congress was concerned primarily and we don't challenge this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5473.331" offset="21996648">Congress was concerned primarily with the entry of foreign agents or the exit of foreign agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="5480.361" offset="22024861">But we think it also intended to authorize the President or the Secretary of State to deal with the kinds of restrictions which the Department of State had on its own instituted as of 1914 in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5497.032" offset="22091525">From 1914 through to the end of World War I, passports were endorsed in the restrictive manner as appears on the footnote on page 22 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5511.407" offset="22148995">And in the Senate as well, Senator Shields, who was the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee which reported out this Bill, specifically referred to it as legislation so broad in principle and so flexible that they can be adopted by the President and those whom he will authorize to enforce them to any particular conditions adopted by the President to any particular conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5533.290" offset="22236557">So although the proponents of the Bill did not refer specifically to area restrictions, we think that they intended to comprehend them within the power that they gave to the Secretary to determine what is in effect a valid passport.</text>

            <text syncTime="5612.478" offset="22553266">Now, it's true that the statement issued by the Department of State at the time that it continued to impose travel restrictions to Germany in 1919, did not specifically refer to Section -- what is now Section 1185.</text>
            <text syncTime="5628.441" offset="22617109">But we think it's substantially doubtful as to whether that Section could even have applied in 1919, although there had been no formal peace treaty.</text>
