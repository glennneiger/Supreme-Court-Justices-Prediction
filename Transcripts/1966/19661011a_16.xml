            <text syncTime="18.605" offset="177821">As I closed yesterday, I was touching upon a question asked by Mr. Justice Harlan concerning the exclusion of certain material offered at defendant's trial in McCracken Circuit Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.628" offset="253889">I was making the point that the exhibits, which were not permitted to be placed in evidence by the trial judge, were not similar to the two magazines Spree and High Heels upon which this prosecution was based.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.430" offset="317106">There were first six paperback books.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.981" offset="327346">They were recognized literary works although containing, of course, questionable passages.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.189" offset="348139">One of them was Henry Miller's work Tropic of Capricorn.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.591" offset="373739">These books are certainly not similar in any degree to the two girlie magazines for which Mr. Austin was being prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.590" offset="409684">They were literary works.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.682" offset="414072">The girlie magazines have no literary value whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.290" offset="428492">They were entirely printed materials whereas the girlie magazines had most of their prurient interest appeal based on photographs of nude and semi-nude females.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.733" offset="474258">As to the material and the public library, it cannot possibly be argued that because the nude form is accepted in the museum of modern art and in series of photographic issues and they invoked some great sculpture that we must therefore accept the same exposure of the nude female form in the girlie magazines in the style and format in which the form is displayed in those magazines.</text>

            <text syncTime="150.016" offset="703404">And he was asked if the magazines in his expert opinion were such as would create a morbid interest or prurient interest in nudity or sex in the average person and this was objected to but he was permitted to answer and he said, no, quite the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="411.098" offset="1747780">Well, unfortunately, the defendant was not able to answer that categorically, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.389" offset="1768887">He said merely there has never been an objection that we didn't observe and correct and adjust.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.884" offset="1790934">In other words, he's been selling this same type of magazine but there had been objections previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.008" offset="1811414">And finally, since he brought it up, it was brought out in 1960, about three years before this particular sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.714" offset="1842239">The city commissioners of the City of Paducah had come to him and objected to this type of magazine -- that is the classic girlie magazines that he was distributing.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.054" offset="1883617">And as a result of this complaint at that time, he did was to get all the girlie magazines from a retail store located near a school.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.393" offset="1928965">This was not yet Read More retail newsstand but another retail store that he was supplying in his capacity as a wholesale news distributor.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.278" offset="1968462">So, he was asked that question, haven't you been selling that same type of magazine for years?</text>
            <text syncTime="472.583" offset="1993749">And he said, yes, I've been selling the same thing for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.524" offset="2005452">Then they went ahead with it and I said I'm without objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.483" offset="2017259">This was to show that this type of magazine had been generally accepted in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.715" offset="2034186">Unfortunately, he could not answer that by saying there had never been an objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.757" offset="2050382">As a matter of fact, he had to say that there had been an objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.653" offset="2061981">So this in itself shows that this type of magazine had not been accepted by the community.</text>

            <text syncTime="516.169" offset="2168038">And I think the questions were the sale of this material in the area in which he operated, if I'm not mistaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.984" offset="2203355">I might have to agree with you that perhaps the thrust of this was really in this Paducah area because certainly that's where his Read More newsstand was located.</text>

            <text syncTime="829.415" offset="3421080">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.341" offset="3432782">I would like first to address myself to matter raised by Mr. Justice Fortas and that was whether or not the instruction given to the jury that they must find beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant knew the contents and the character of the material was such that the jury knew that they had to find, as the state conceived they had to affirm that he knew the material was in fact obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.655" offset="3553991">The plain answer is, we respectfully submit that the jury could not have so understood it.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.300" offset="3576560">And I call attention to page 23 of the record and there, the witness was Reverend Simpson.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.172" offset="3620028">He was asked about two magazines not the two magazines involved in this case but two other girlie magazines that were shown to Mr. Austin at the time of his meeting with the ministerial association.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.110" offset="3683767">Objection was made to the showing of these other magazines on the ground that they had nothing to do with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.081" offset="3711666">And the Court, that I will let the jury consider it for the purpose of whether or not he had knowledge of the class or character.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.195" offset="3740191">It's plain, therefore, that what was meant by "character" was, that Mr. Austin knew that he had girlie magazines and only that.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.044" offset="3775509">Not that he knew the contents of the two specific magazines involved and surely not that he knew that the two specific magazines involved were in fact obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.119" offset="3823888">Now, in light of the concession by the respondent that the state did have the burden of proving that the defendant knew the material wasn't in fact obscene, in light of the ambiguity of the instruction given where it was never stated to the jury that they had to find that he knew the magazine was obscene, then surely the defendant requested instruction that he should be found not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.362" offset="3924825">If the jury found that he in good faith believe that to be not obscene, should have been given.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.742" offset="3954291">And we submit that such an instruction must be given in the light of the First Amendment in every case because of the very nature of these obscenity proceedings where the jury is really all to, ready to convict, without sufficient evidence as of the case right here.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.618" offset="4033808">The prosecute -- the respondent says that the defendants, the -- that the, respondent had the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant, the petitioner here knew the contents of the magazine and knew it to be obscene and there is enough evidence in this case, to support either of them and the jury has no hesitance in returning its verdict of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.672" offset="4126072">I believe what the Court pointed out in the case of Unites States against Cloud that there is a great danger in this field because of the strong emotions that aroused in jurors for a jury to convict not on evidence but on prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.757" offset="4190438">I would like to suggest one word of the presumptions if I may, Mr. --</text>

            <text syncTime="1027.861" offset="4214784">The respondent has indicated that the presumption that is found in 436 subdivision 4 was not used in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.233" offset="4256266">But that's not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.218" offset="4264208">The fact of the matter is, that since there was no evidence that the defendant knew the material was obscene, the only way the case could have been submitted to the jury was to utilize the presumption that a person who sold magazines, found by a jury to be obscene, may meant that the respondent knew in fact that the publications were obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.561" offset="4357622">Moreover, it caused the petitioner to take the stand in order to rebut the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.465" offset="4393253">The fact that it was meaningful in this case is found on, in the record of page 112 where the attorney for the petitioner, right after the conviction, was complaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.715" offset="4450200">In his motion for a dismissal, he points out that that statute under which the defendant was prosecuted is unconstitutional, is violating the Fourteenth Amendment, because it released the Commonwealth of the duty to prove knowledge on the part of the defendant of the fact of the obscenity of the magazines as obscene they were.</text>
