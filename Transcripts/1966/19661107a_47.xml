            <text syncTime="42.346" offset="272802">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.849" offset="282728">This is a direct appeal from the dismissal of an indictment by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.410" offset="301014">That court decision was bases upon its interpretation of the statute upon which the indictment was founded that is 18 U.S. Code Section 1953 and the only question before this Court on direct appeal is the interpretation of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.024" offset="363499">So far as it is relevant here, Section 1953 prohibits anyone except the common carrier in the usual course of this business form knowingly transporting in interstate commerce "any record, paraphernalia, ticket, certificate, bills, slip, token, paper, writing or other device used or to be used or adapted device or design for used in wagering pools with respect to a sporting event."</text>
            <text syncTime="99.051" offset="499545">The indictment which the lower court dismissed closely parallel to statutory language, it alleges that on or about August 24 1964, Anthony L. Fabrizio, the appellee, knowingly carried in interstate commerce from Keene, New Hampshire to Elmira, New York "records, papers writings, to wit: 75 acknowledgments of purchase for a sweepstakes race of the State of New Hampshire, to be used, and adapted, devised and designed for use, in a wagering pool with respect to a sporting event," that is: a sweepstakes race of the State of New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.333" offset="656697">The indictment was filed in the Western District of New York in September 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.482" offset="681253">In October 1964, appellee filed a motion to dismiss the indictment accompanied by an affidavit of his former counsel setting forth appellee's interpretation of the statute of Section 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.532" offset="737468">The Government filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss and the motion was submitted on the papers without oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.597" offset="777801">On October 5, 1965 the District Court dismissed the indictment stating only the following reason "the charge in the indictment does not come within the purpose of Section 1953 as disclosed in the legislative history of the Act, the court did not further elaborate the position."</text>
            <text syncTime="192.142" offset="871946">Under the limiting provisions of the Criminal Appeals Act under which this direct appeal is brought the sufficiency of the indictment as a pleading is not before this Court and neither is the question whether the Government can adduce sufficient proof to establish its factual allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.473" offset="937253">Stated concretely the only question involved here is the following, does an indictment alleging the knowing interstate carriage of acknowledgements of purchase to be used an adapted device and designed for use in the New Hampshire sweepstakes state a crime under Section 1953?</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="227.570" offset="1013635">Is this a state lottery?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jerome_i_chapman" startTime="230.172" stopTime="478.639">
            <label>Mr. Jerome I. Chapman</label>
            <text syncTime="230.172" offset="1024084">It is.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.870" offset="1030875">I'm printing that now Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.464" offset="1037249">So I would like at the outset to briefly sketch the mechanics of the New Hampshire sweepstakes operation and to touch upon the function therein of the acknowledgement of purchase which is the paper that appellee carried in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.291" offset="1104541">After doing this I'll turn to the legal questions involved in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.783" offset="1122513">The New Hampshire sweepstakes is operated by the New Hampshire Commission established by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.626" offset="1161906">It is by undoubted -- undeniably a legal operation within the State of New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.810" offset="1182595">New Hampshire sweepstakes tickets maybe purchased at the sweepstakes commission headquarters at 51 state liquor stores, two race tracks and two highway toll plazas within the State of New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.441" offset="1237138">The tickets are in the first instance contained in a specially designed ticket dispensing machine which is very much like the airline insurance policy dispensing machine that is quite common.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.722" offset="1298265">The sweepstakes ticket itself, now I have a copy of the ticket here which you may not all be able to see but the facsimile of the acknowledgement of purchase appears on the page nine in the record in it's a -- as I will point out the differences and similarities it may be easier to refer to that rather than to -- what I have in my hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.969" offset="1379244">In the machine when one first approaches the machine through an opening at the top the sweepstakes ticket appears in such a manner that one can write the required information on the face of the ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.809" offset="1426578">Now immediately beneath that ticket in the machine is the acknowledgement of purchase which is essentially identical, I will point out in a moment the differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.904" offset="1462941">This is not visible to the purchaser, it's inside the machine underneath the ticket and it's put there so that one writing on the ticket will make a carbon copy and pressure it on the same lines on the acknowledgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.804" offset="1518634">The information asked on the ticket as the copy on page nine shows is the name, address, city and state.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.637" offset="1553951">When a person wants to buy a sweepstakes ticket at one of the various locations where the tickets are sold, he first goes to a clerk in the store or at the office or at the race track and pays three dollars per ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.584" offset="1621661">Upon receiving the money the clerk activates this ticket dispensing machine for the sale of -- as many tickets as the person has paid for up to 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.716" offset="1658232">The most you can get one stretch is 10 tickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.487" offset="1673279">The purchaser then proceeds to the machine and writes on the face of the ticket itself a name, address, and a city and a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.386" offset="1704939">Doesn't have to be that persons own name and address in fact it doesn't have to be any persons' name and address.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.296" offset="1724583">It can be a club or a corporation or a school or an association or it can be more than one person, mister and misses so and so.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.062" offset="1755617">But the name and address that appears on the ticket and simultaneously is recorded on the carbon copy on the acknowledgement is crucial because the prizes on the sweepstakes are awarded on the basis of that name and that address.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.980" offset="1815280">The -- after the person has written the name and address on the ticket he pulls a lever.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.518" offset="1841403">At that point the ticket and the acknowledgement part company, the ticket is deposited inside the machine, the acknowledgment is ejected and for the -- for whatever purposes the purchaser wants to make of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.034" offset="1891558">At this point let me point out exactly where the acknowledgement and the sweepstakes ticket itself differ.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.996" offset="1919352">They are in fact identical with one exception where the tickets has printed somewhat slightly above the top of the top half of the page in large print New Hampshire sweepstakes ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.301" offset="1964596">The acknowledgement and this is shown better in the record on page 9 contains a legend which says that this is not a ticket, this is an acknowledgement, you don't have to present this to win a prize, it says as an essence.</text>

            <text syncTime="489.384" offset="2060936">Let me make one further point about this acknowledgement with reference to the facsimile in the record just to make it perfectly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.288" offset="2092492">This facsimile in the record is approximately the -- is almost exactly the actual size, there's a slight variation.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.534" offset="2125511">In the record there are some parts of the printing comes -- come out very prominently, very heavy.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.614" offset="2145782">Other parts come out very light.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.065" offset="2151633">Well, actually what that represent is different colors.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.631" offset="2161873">The part that comes out very heavy here is really just red typed, the part that comes out light is blue typed so that in the actual acknowledgement this phrase that this is only an acknowledgement, it need not be presented while its quite clear does not come out, thus not stand out as prominently as it -- as one would expect looking only at the way the facsimile is recorded in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="570.965" offset="2387257">So just to preserve the identity of the individual involved and since he was not relevant they blanked that out.</text>

            <text syncTime="578.708" offset="2418186">But on all acknowledgements of course there would be a name and address and then the city and the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.913" offset="2435009">Now this is what happens and this is directed to your question Mr. Chief Justice, after the lever is pulled the ticket is deposited within the machine and the acknowledgement is ejected outside the machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.453" offset="2481194">Let me direct myself now only to the ticket, we'll leave acknowledgement to one side but the ticket is the thing that counts as far as winning the price is concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.903" offset="2510973">The tickets are deposited in the machine and are collected by sweepstakes commission agents periodically.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.242" offset="2540335">When they are collected from the machines they are taken directly to bank deposit vaults in various parts of the state and ultimately are gathered together in one bank vault in Manchester, New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.908" offset="2594983">Process of selling tickets in the sweepstakes goes over a relatively long period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.527" offset="2617448">There where two sweepstakes races run this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.091" offset="2627688">For the first one, the ticket selling period covered about an 11 month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.533" offset="2645556">But for the second one, it was about a six month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.240" offset="2652348">So all this tickets over time are collected and put into the bank vault.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.081" offset="2667708">Finally, very shortly before the sweepstake race is run, the sweepstakes race is one of the factors in determining who wins what prizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.237" offset="2700309">Very shortly before this time the tickets are placed in drums or barrels from which they are to be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.538" offset="2729566">Shortly before the race, a certain number of tickets are drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.777" offset="2742523">Now the number varies somewhat depending on how much money has been put into the pool, how much money has been bet by the various purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.842" offset="2774706">But for simplicities sake and I think this will serve our purposes, its fair to say that there is one ticket drawn for each horse nominated in the sweepstake race.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.063" offset="2815666">In other words there may be 300 horses nominated or eligible for a running in the particular race that's involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.325" offset="2848684">If that's so, 300 tickets will be drawn and each ticket will be matched with one of the eligible horses.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.204" offset="2876165">Everyone whose ticket is thus drawn is entitled to some price simply because his ticket is drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.885" offset="2906885">This year, in the 1966 sweepstakes those people whose tickets were drawn in the first instance and didn't get any further prices shared in a pool of $60,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.901" offset="2950980">Now after the 300 tickets are drawn, the day of the race comes and of course 300 tickets -- 300 horses don't run on the race only a certain number of them, lets say for example 20, actually finally do get entered into the race and are off when the race is called.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.228" offset="3020257">Well, the persons whose tickets are matched with these 20 horses qualify for a higher price.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.972" offset="3043244">This year those persons shared in a pool of $20,000 there.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.764" offset="3062471">Roughly their price was something like five or six times more than the people who were matched with horses that never ran.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.947" offset="3091205">Finally of course, there are the top three prizes which are determined on the basis of the horses that run first, second and third in the race.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.397" offset="3124955">If my ticket was matched with the horse that ran first, this year I would've won $50,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.934" offset="3147107">If I had a ticket matched with the second horse, I would've won $25,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.254" offset="3160377">If I had a ticket matched with the third horse, I would've won $12,500.</text>

            <text syncTime="881.209" offset="3628178">One thing can be said clearly about the acknowledgment as a carbon copy of the sweepstakes ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.437" offset="3661093">It serves to show that a ticket had actually been purchased in the name and address of the person whose name and address appears on this, to the carbon copy.</text>

            <text syncTime="906.531" offset="3729533">At this point I would like to only point out only one primarily because this is the function that we alleged that we point it out in our brief, we expect to prove was the actual function of it, of the 75 acknowledgements used in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.072" offset="3787630">Namely to facilitate the purchase of New Hampshire sweepstakes tickets by persons who did not actually travel to New Hampshire, did not actually come into the state and bought their tickets there.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.888" offset="3834964">In other words it would operate and we expect to prove that it did operate in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.482" offset="3857324">Someone acting as a broker, in this case the defendant, the appellee Mr. Fabrizio would solicit sales of New Hampshire sweepstakes tickets in other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.587" offset="3901733">Here, it was in New York and Pennsylvania and would take orders from his customers, get their names and their addresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.272" offset="3940498">Then after having compiled a sufficient number of orders travel to the State of New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.734" offset="3958262">Buy tickets in their names and addresses by writing the customers name, the customers address on each of these tickets, get and acknowledge therefore.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.675" offset="3986056">Now, as I've said, the acknowledgement verifies officially that a ticket has been purchased for Joe Jones, 401 5th Street for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.360" offset="4024822">With this acknowledgement, the broker can travel back to New York or whatever state it is and verify to his customers that he has in fact carried out the -- their orders.</text>

            <text syncTime="1498.623" offset="6097899">This is known as flash paper.</text>

            <text syncTime="1524.494" offset="6201344">But unless it is also alleged that that flash paper had a function which is proscribed in the act, for example, used in bookmaking, a violation of the Act is not made out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1902.817" offset="7714670">In the first place, the sufficiency of the indictment as a pleading is not an issue in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1941.104" offset="7867747">Now it's a question of -- that's a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.275" offset="7876524">When I responded to your question as to whether the individual purchaser would be liable under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.528" offset="7901497">I was doing that on an -- on my own assumption as to what the fact is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1975.937" offset="8007137">One other point I'd like to make and again in reference to your problem Mr. Justice Fortas is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.936" offset="8035140">Any time you have a criminal statute which draws a sharp line as it should between what is illegal on the one hand and what is legal on the other hand you're bound to have a cluster of cases at the borderline that might post difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.128" offset="8091878">It might be a little close in interpretation one way or the other indeed might even raise constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.996" offset="8115388">But it's never been and this is so in any criminal statute that sharply defines the line of illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.838" offset="8146735">But it's never been held that because at the borderline there might be difficulties and there might be problems that when we're dealing with a case that is quite four square within the meaning of the statute that we -- that we in any way modify the position that we would take in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2132.947" offset="8635120">We allege that it had a function in that sweepstakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.470" offset="8653302">In our view this is a sufficient allegation under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.057" offset="8667617">The appellee says this is not a sufficient because in their understanding a wagering pool with respect to a sporting event as encompassed in Section 1953 means an illegal wagering pool, illegal under the laws of the state where it originates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.713" offset="8738252">Now that's where we really have a dispute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.660" offset="8745984">That's the legal question that brings us to this Court Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.067" offset="8771688">We contend that the statute applies to wit: any papers that have a use in any wagering pool with respect to a sporting event regardless of whether that wagering pool is legal within its state of origin or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.186" offset="8828113">In our view, the legality of a wagering enterprise within its home state is not material to the definition of the offense in 1953 because Section 1953 only comes into a -- only comes into operation when gambling transcends state boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.909" offset="8898957">The -- and this is the situation that happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.938" offset="8927169">We have a crossing of state boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.568" offset="8937618">Now I think we can look to the -- all of the typical indicia for -- of congressional intent and congressional meanig and find that any wagering pool whether its legal in the state of operation or illegal in the state of operation, its contemplated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.197" offset="9004178">Let me say at the outset of course the New Hampshire sweepstakes is legal in the State of New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.358" offset="9032808">But it's not in any way unique in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.770" offset="9046497">There are more than 75 countries and I (Inaudible) that this statute covers interstate as well as foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.263" offset="9076381">More that 75 countries have legal sweepstakes or lottery operations including Mexico, our very near neighbor to the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.165" offset="9108041">In addition to what you might call a strictly foreign country, the American Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has for many years had its -- has a legal sweepstakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.181" offset="9144090">And it come even closer to home, the State of Nevada presently and certainly at the time this statute was enacted licensed bookmaking and sporting pools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.709" offset="9186200">And both of this operations, bookmaking and sporting pools are covered by Section 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.464" offset="9209187">So, the State of New Hampshire doesn't stand out any unique -- doesn't put itself in any unique position because gambling is legalized there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2413.212" offset="9756191">The statute doesn't distinguish between illegal wagering pools and the legal wagering pools but it does create certain exceptions for certain types of wagering.</text>

            <text syncTime="2438.899" offset="9859009">In addition, Congress carved out an exception for legal pari-mutuel betting material and this is the one that I think is of some special relevance here, for the carrying of materials to be used in the placing of bets on a sporting event into a state where such betting is legal by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.737" offset="9950333">Now when Congress set up this very narrow and very carefully drawn pattern of exceptions, it cannot be said that they -- that the courts are free to imply by some form of interpolation a further exception not set out by Congress for the carriage of wagering materials from a state where those materials are legal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2656.717" offset="10730245">That pari-mutuel betting itself -- well first of all, by the way, the exception is not for any pari-mutuel betting but only for legal pari-mutuel betting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.584" offset="10761697">But legal pari-mutuel betting was not considered by the Senators and Congressmen who addressed themselves to this issue as being an evil where the states sought to -- saw fit to legalize this type of operation which is quite closely confined to a single place, a race track.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.651" offset="10837974">The Senators and Congressmen felt there was a no need for the Federal Government to enter into this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.679" offset="10882069">In addition of course that its well-known and it was mentioned in the hearing that there are a number of race track that are located near state line so that everyday people go from the District of Columbia perhaps to Laurel, Maryland or to Charles Town, West Virginia and there's a lot of interstate commerce involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.992" offset="10955316">But in essence all we're doing is -- all that's involved is a simple -- singly located pari-mutuel operation and they wanted to -- they want to exempt that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.709" offset="10998157">Quite in contrast to that is many sweepstakes and certainly the New Hampshire operation where there's -- in one instance an 11 month period of buying tickets are -- and the second is that this year, a six month period of buying tickets as opposed to pari-mutuel situation where you buy your ticket before the race.</text>

            <text syncTime="2742.548" offset="11073599">I think these are the considerations that were expressed and entered the minds of the legislators on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.539" offset="11105573">But the -- there is a -- they say an exemption for carrying materials into a place such as Nevada or indeed into New Hampshire for use in this state legalized operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.285" offset="11180492">But when the -- when there's a possibility of opening a base camp, let us say a bookmaker, opening up a headquarters in Nevada but all legal bookmaking material were exempt -- were exempted from the statute whether it was coming into Nevada or going out from Nevada this would be a boon to Nevada bookmakers because they could open up a headquarters there and operate in other states in violation of those state laws from that camp.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.875" offset="11278921">All they have to worry of course are the laws of the other states which the -- this statute among other things was designed to fortify, to assist them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.231" offset="11336286">Its not at all surprising I might -- I should note, as we do note in our brief that Congress would pass a statute prohibiting the interstate transportation of material that in its inception at least is related to a legal wagering pool or a legal sporting operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.954" offset="11411205">Because for over 90 years Congress has had a statute which has prohibited the mailing of material that is connected to legal lotteries or legal wagering pools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.582" offset="11457703">Now this statute has been -- had been very narrowly construed, this is now in the U.S. Code in Section 1301 through 1305.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.167" offset="11492080">The statute is not nearly as broad as 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.635" offset="11505873">It doesn't cover all the paraphernalia and materials that related primarily to lottery tickets or things that could be held as a matter of fact to represent a lottery ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.555" offset="11545579">Congress was disturbed and discussed at great length the limitations that had been placed on the prior statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.114" offset="11575777">And one of the purposes of 1953 was to plug the loop holes that had been opened up the earlier legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.227" offset="11608273">But for our purposes here it's only relevant to know that the earlier and this is not at all contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.069" offset="11627604">It's recognized in the briefs of the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.078" offset="11639724">Here the statutes did apply to the mailing of for example Irish sweepstakes ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.308" offset="11660622">Irish sweepstakes are perfectly legal in Ireland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.856" offset="11674833">But when they're to be mailed out of that country here, they violate -- they had for many years violated Section 1301.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.516" offset="11709419">And now the same thing, if interstate transportation is involved would violate Section 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.794" offset="11734497">The course the same is true, we contend with respect to the New Hampshire sweepstakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.339" offset="11756753">There's no real difference for these purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.739" offset="11766366">One point is dwelled upon at great length in appellee's briefs and the amicus briefs filed by the State of New Hampshire and that is the discussion in the legislative hearings and the Senate on how -- about organized crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.925" offset="11823104">Well it is true that organized crime was considered a very serious problem by the legislators who enacted this statute and certainly that one of the aims of the statute was to put a crimp into the operations of organized criminal syndicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.984" offset="11903352">But the statute went and plainly so went farther than that very, very limited purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.957" offset="11939192">It clearly was intended to apply as was recognized in the hearings to an individual bookmaker or individual operator of the lottery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.594" offset="11981720">It was not connected with any syndicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.314" offset="11996662">The point was to close the channels of interstate commerce to gambling operations which otherwise would transcends state lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.781" offset="12046503">Subsidiary purpose was to assist the states of the union and by far the majority of the states and the union prohibit off track betting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.949" offset="12087150">All of them prohibit strictly a numbers game and most of them prohibit lottery operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.649" offset="12121945">The idea was to assist this states in the enforcement of there statutes as something that would be defeated if as an example I gave before I -- bookmaker in Nevada were allowed freely to operate throughout the country from that home base.</text>

            <text syncTime="3049.760" offset="12302399">And the other states in the union maintain there prohibitions against gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.928" offset="12327058">Shortly after the sweepstakes was initiated I think in 1964 the New Hampshire Sweepstakes Commission sent out a memorandum to prosecuting and law enforcement officers in all the states describing the sweepstakes operations and explaining the safeguards that were attempted to be build into the operations to avoid conflict with the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.328" offset="12416711">But they did point out and properly so and I read briefly from the memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.541" offset="12441579">When one state permits the sale of sweepstakes or lottery tickets and others prohibits such sale the primary danger is that tickets purchased lawfully in New Hampshire would be resold unlawfully elsewhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="3936.131" offset="15847946">And he seems to have conceded that this indictment does not violate the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3942.210" offset="15872188">Nevertheless, he says that if an additional wagering purpose is shown at the trial of this case then in that event the indictment is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3957.095" offset="15931747">Now I think procedurally the Court should understand that the Government appears to have conceded that this indictment as it is read in any reasonable normal common sense way is not sufficient to charge a crime as the District Court held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3977.222" offset="16012309">At the -- after the indictment was returned there was a motion for a bill of particulars made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.704" offset="16034147">The Government came forth alleging no other violation of federal, state or local law and nearly again reiterated their claim that the defendant carried New Hampshire sweepstakes in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.770" offset="16086497">Then we have the motion to dismiss the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.297" offset="16096528">Again, no other facts such you say are now alleging are presented to the District Court where possibly a decision could be made on them, possibly a motion to amend the bill of particulars could be made sovereigns from the Government until they argue in the brief in this Court that there is additional prejudicial conduct which is really not relevant to this indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.109" offset="16195793">The statute says anybody who carries wagering paraphernalia proscribed by the statute in interstate commerce violates the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4031.425" offset="16229021">That's what the indictment charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="4033.454" offset="16237171">So that any wagering para -- conduct which this defendant, this appellee may have been guilty of is not a violation of Section 1953 and the Government is talking about something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.156" offset="16295999">And if they are talking about something else then it be whom -- the Government to move for another indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.889" offset="16318882">And I think on the basis of this very -- this -- what I understood to be tantamount to a concession or there's -- this Court should affirm the decision below.</text>

            <text syncTime="4184.216" offset="16840286">This statute was passed in response to a modern problem of organized crime which had infiltrated Governments at the local and state level.</text>
            <text syncTime="4196.474" offset="16889292">It was multi-state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4197.773" offset="16894516">It was a web, a design, a pattern of illegal business activities which the states were unable to pierce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4206.271" offset="16928475">In response to this specific problem of organized, illegal organized activity, these statutes were passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.073" offset="16967659">Now, it is necessary to point out that we are talking here about activity which is conducted by a stock sovereign state as has been mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4232.644" offset="17033906">And the fact of its being conducted by a sovereign state precludes the possibility of its being the kind of wagering pool within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4242.914" offset="17075075">The Government is using a sort of in terrorem approach here and claiming that if we permit New Hampshire to be not within the coverage of this statute that states will be inundated with illegal wagering paraphernalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="4260.565" offset="17145605">In order for such a thing to take place you would have to assume an absurd example that a state is a renegade and will in violation of the laws of a sister state inundate the state with its own wagering paraphernalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="4276.513" offset="17209448">This is an absurd example to justify the absurd conclusion that the judge -- the Government is asking for here.</text>

            <text syncTime="5576.548" offset="22409592">New Hampshire is here for the very reason that some of the questions from the bench have laid mainly because this indictment read as any ordinary person would read it could be applied to any tourist who travels to New Hampshire, buy sweepstakes tickets and takes the acknowledgments back with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5599.319" offset="22500603">The indictment does not raise the issues which the Government argues in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5606.011" offset="22527457">And unless I misread Borden and all the subsequent cases the Government cannot so construe the indictment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5615.025" offset="22563506">Now, the Government seems to take the positions that they can construe this indictment differently from the way it was necessarily construed by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5624.447" offset="22601122">I don't understand the rule that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5626.867" offset="22610840">I understand that the only issue raised on an appeal under Section 3731 is whether or not the construction placed upon the statute by the District Court is correct and that this Court has said in its own opinions on numerous occasions that it will be bound by the construction placed on the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5648.579" offset="22697671">Now the only construction that could be placed on the indictment on this record is the construction which is a dumbgraded by the questions which had been asked here namely if the Government shows nothing more than this indictment alleges, is it a violation of the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="5665.858" offset="22766843">And this offends the State of New Hampshire because it would mean that the 2 or 3 million tourists who come to New Hampshire every year and who constitute the principal source of our revenue for this educational program would be subject to indictment under this statute and we don't believe that was the intention of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="5757.497" offset="23133393">Section 1953 certainly purports to prohibit the carriage in interstate commerce of wagering paraphernalia which is in some way use, useful etcetera in the terms of the statute in various proscribed and very narrowly limited activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5781.547" offset="23229524">Now those particular activities, the legislative history shows are all activities which are concerned with crime and racketeering and other source of the principle bankroll for a crime in this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="5828.374" offset="23416874">The only wagering pool with respect to a sporting event that the Government is talking about is the New Hampshire sweepstakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5834.639" offset="23441951">Now the paraphernalia, there must be something to give Congress power and they purported to act on the interstate commerce power to give Congress power in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5846.387" offset="23488972">They have to show that the wagering pool, that the paraphernalia which is carried in interstate commerce is in some way a part of it, operative part of the wagering pool in such a way that its carried in interstate commerce is within the commerce control power of Congress or that it offends the laws of some other state.</text>

            <text syncTime="6428.550" offset="25817527">The legislative history of course demonstrates that 1953 was concerned with an entirely differently problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="6435.109" offset="25843858">This has been briefed at some length in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6437.160" offset="25852008">We point out that the Louisiana lottery against which 1301 was specifically directed was flooding the country with thousands and thousands of sweepstakes -- lottery tickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="6449.343" offset="25900701">But quite aside from that I'd like to bring to the attention to the court the fact that as far as 1301 is concern and as far as 1953 also is concern the State of New Hampshire could run a lottery and give out pieces of paper equivalent to its acknowledgements here and the Government would not contend and could not contend that it was covered by 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="6478.869" offset="26018879">1953 was tailor made for the specific type of organized gambling activity that the Justice Department was aiming at.</text>
            <text syncTime="6490.937" offset="26067153">And it is required as the Government admits in its argument that one of the elements which must be shown is that there is a piece of paraphernalia associated with a wagering pool with respect to a sporting event.</text>
            <text syncTime="6504.225" offset="26120234">Now an ordinary lottery doesn't involving -- doesn't involve a sporting event at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6509.014" offset="26139460">So that if we were running an ordinary lottery we wouldn't be here, there wouldn't be any problem under the Government's own position and for them to say that 1953 is simply an amendment or an extension of 1301.</text>
            <text syncTime="6522.078" offset="26191705">Its completely at variance not only with the legislative history but also with any fair analysis of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="8108.236" offset="32536325">One, that you can only -- that the only way you can get more than 10 New Hampshire sweepstakes tickets is to go the commission and buy a bulk order.</text>
            <text syncTime="8114.739" offset="32562343">I understand that that's not the case that the machines are only activated for 10 tickets sales at a time.</text>
            <text syncTime="8119.840" offset="32582719">But if a person for example wanted to buy 20 tickets at a liquor store, he could do that by paying a clerk $30, writing out 10 tickets, returning to the clerk and paying 30 more dollars and writing out 20 more tickets that you don't have to buy -- that if you -- you can buy more than 10 other than by going in and registering with the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="8138.429" offset="32657115">Mr. Millimet also suggests that if what New Hampshire had was a lottery rather than a sweepstakes it wouldn't be covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="8145.388" offset="32684910">Well, I think that that would be covered by the second, the lower down section of the Act which applies to numbers, policy and similar games that a lottery is similar to a numbers game and if the drawing based on the face -- on the number.</text>
