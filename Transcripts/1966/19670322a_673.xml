            <label>Mr. Curtiss K. Thompson</label>
            <text syncTime="10.426" offset="145115">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court pleases.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.438" offset="165073">This suit for the recovery of federal estate taxes depends on the final analysis upon how much property the widow of the decedent receives under a residuary bequest.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.422" offset="241037">The petition for certiorari presented two questions for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.130" offset="267891">First, whether the Court of Appeals' decision holding that estate taxes should not be apportioned between the widow and the grandchildren, who were the other residuary legatees, was in conflict with the law of the State of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.736" offset="354304">And the second question is whether or not the decree of the probate court which decided the matter differently than the Court of Appeals did was binding in conclusive upon the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.247" offset="428387">Mr. Brewster, when he made his will gave one-third of the residue to his widow in trust, and two-thirds to nine grandchildren each in a separate trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.392" offset="492962">His will contained a tax clause which Your Honors will find printed on page 12 of the record, it was Article I of the will, and which is a little long to read.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.054" offset="567568">The -- it's noteworthy that these two residuary bequests to the widow and the grandchildren, when the will was made, were equally taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.074" offset="623679">Therefore, it made no difference whether the testator directed that these estate taxes should be apportioned between the residuary bequests or whether he directed differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.449" offset="685119">The estate would have been distributed in the same manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.632" offset="709883">But Mr. Brewster made a codicil to his will.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.939" offset="731094">And when he did that, he ordered the bequest to the widow, which as I said was in trust, so that it qualified for the marital deduction and became tax exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.721" offset="798281">Now, as soon as that change was made, it became important to both the widow and to the grandchildren as to whether or not the estate taxes were to be apportioned or prorated between them because the widow's gift at that point was tax exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.855" offset="898800">Now, if you had a proration between those two gifts, the widow would bear no part of the estate taxes under residuary bequests, or under residual properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.927" offset="975078">If there was no proration, she would thus the tax clause which was written when this -- when it gets briefly taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.886" offset="1066924">And when the testator did not have this problem in mind and did not speak to it, the question becomes whether that tax clause or what the effect of this act to the codicil he had written.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="252.951" stopTime="259.099">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="252.951" offset="1115199">He certainly had the general problem in mind when he wrote the codicil.</text>

            <text syncTime="260.625" offset="1145919">Because the codicil was obviously for the purpose of giving the residuary bequest to the widow, the benefit of the marital deduction generally, wasn't it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Curtiss K. Thompson</label>
            <text syncTime="283.717" offset="1238288">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.091" offset="1243721">Now, I think I ought to make it clear just exactly what taxes we're talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.667" offset="1274023">We're not speaking of the Connecticut succession tax which is the chief death duty in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.129" offset="1303907">That is not involved here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.934" offset="1315088">We're speaking only of the estate taxes, and only of such -- only about such part of them as arise out of the residual properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.005" offset="1375378">For example, the widow's gift is nontaxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.014" offset="1391470">That generates no estate taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.070" offset="1403695">The gifts to the grandchildren are taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.350" offset="1420727">Therefore, the properties distributed to them generate taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.292" offset="1448521">Also, out for the residue, a very substantial sum of money was paid for death duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.186" offset="1492093">Those death duties, of course, are not deductible items in computing taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.031" offset="1515499">Therefore, the moneys that we use for the payment of the death duties also generate estate taxes and they are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.576" offset="1581641">The executers, of course, were aware of the problem that faced them in this matter and of the importance of it to the widow and to the grandchildren because the sums involved were substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.409" offset="1653008">The executives first have to deal with the problem when they filed their federal estate tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.554" offset="1689579">And they computed their tax obligations there on the premise that no part of these taxes, which I have described were to be born by the widow and that all were to be paid out of the grandchildren's share.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.547" offset="1765543">The Internal Revenue Service could not agree with that treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.550" offset="1785605">And eventually, they said that a deficiency would be assessed on that account.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.493" offset="1829386">Now, such a deficiency, as I indicated in my opening sentence, turns entirely upon the law of Connecticut and upon the amount of money that is distributable under Connecticut law to the will.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.128" offset="1915904">It does not involve any interpretation of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.654" offset="1949968">At the time that the executor's and Internal Revenue Service joined the issue on this matter, three years gone by since the testators' death.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.884" offset="2010885">It was obvious to the executor's that the matter was going to have to be settled and was going to have to be settled by a Connecticut court.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.309" offset="2056652">So at that time -- excuse me a moment -- the executor's filed their first accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.267" offset="2104404">I should say in Connecticut that all the states have judicial counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.541" offset="2129586">They filed that first accounting which showed the payment of all of the death duties that had been assessed at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.956" offset="2175248">This was a statutory obligation of the executor's.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.544" offset="2193533">They also accompanied their administration account with a petition to the Court to rule on this matter concerning the proration of estate taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.445" offset="2245151">And accompanying that petition, they filed a proposed computation of the tax following the same premise that they had used in their federal estate tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.596" offset="2313801">Now, the Government seems to think that in doing that, the executor's were engaging in some slick trick.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.162" offset="2356015">It's not clear from the Government's brief but the implication I think is, that the executor's should not have taken this matter to the fede -- to the probate court but should have let it to the decision perhaps of some federal tribunal which one I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.971" offset="2419231">Certainly, the District Court has no probate jurisdiction and neither does the tax court.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.809" offset="2462595">The executor's and I wish to make this abundantly clear, had no alternative but to ask the probate court to do this because it involved an adjudication of property rights under the law of Connecticut and under the decedent's will.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.027" offset="2559457">The executor's would not have been able to charge these taxes that are in question against either the widow or against the grandchildren without having obtained an order from the probate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.570" offset="2625703">And if you examined the decree that was finally issued, you will see that it authorizes the executor's to make charges for these taxes against the grandchildren's share.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.965" offset="2687248">The -- at one point in its brief, the Government states that this was an effort to avoid estate taxes on the part of the executor's, but that is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.792" offset="2742523">It was a vital step necessary to the settlement of the state unless the executors wish to accept personal responsibility for whatever decision they make.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="673.999" stopTime="678.466">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="673.999" offset="2799365">Do the executors take the position on them when they petitioned the probate court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="curtiss_k_thompson" startTime="678.466" stopTime="1159.570">
            <label>Mr. Curtiss K. Thompson</label>
            <text syncTime="678.466" offset="2817233">The executor's were required by statute to file a proposed computation of the prorates.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.724" offset="2858297">And they did file such a proposed computation and then a sense that is a petition -- a position.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.703" offset="2898213">I don't think that after the executor's have discharged that initial duty, they have any responsibility other than to explain the matter for the probate court because the interested parties, the parties who are either gone to win or lose as a result of the property -- of the determination of their property rights are the ones involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.884" offset="3002911">So the probate court schedule, the hearing on this petition, and notice was given to the widow and to the adult grandchildren, there were two of them, and to the guardian ad litem who represented seven minor grandchildren and he also appeared for the unknown remainderman of the trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.285" offset="3120462">Also in conformity with Connecticut probate practice, there was a newspaper publication of the hearing because our probate proceedings are supposed to be in rem in character and notice is given to the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.003" offset="3195382">Also notice of this hearing was given to the District Director of Internal Revenue.Obviously, all parties as well as the judge were aware of the incidental effect that this determination of property rights would have upon the calculation of the estate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.597" offset="3293811">Notice was given to the district director and he was provided with the copy, the copies of the executor's petition and the computation was stay at filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.359" offset="3352848">The hearing was held on November 27, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.846" offset="3374791">The executives appeared by counsel and submitted the brief justifying or explaining the position which they had taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.274" offset="3420453">The widow did not appear and neither did the adult grandchildren and neither do the District Director of Internal Revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.689" offset="3454098">The guardian ad litem did appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.362" offset="3472802">This was on November 27th.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.717" offset="3494222">After the hearing, time was allowed to guardian for filing a report.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.490" offset="3517315">And he did file a report dated December 22nd in which -- which is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.786" offset="3546467">And in which he said that he had considered this matter, and despite the adverse financial affect upon the -- his words rights, he thought that the computation that had been made by the executor's was the proper one to make under Connecticut law.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.826" offset="3654719">The report that he filed -- he filed a formal report and he also filed a letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.908" offset="3674990">He submitted a letter to the judge explaining his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.245" offset="3696306">And soon after that, if not immediately, the judge of probate passed his order and issued a short memorandum from which it appears that he clearly understood all of the issues that were involved, he understood the importance of the property rights that were at stake and he understood too the effect that this would have upon federal taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.488" offset="3801318">And he cited in his memorandum the leading Connecticut authorities on the question and said that the computation as submitted by the executors was correct, and he ordered that the bequest of the grandchildren be charged with these taxes and were attributable to the residuary properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.119" offset="3919809">Now, the law of Connecticut on this matter is rather simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.844" offset="3946768">And I think the law of Connecticut agrees with the law in most of the states where they have apportionment statutes at least it's identical with the law in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.219" offset="4000266">And that is the -- the law is this that the apportionment statute was enacted to achieve equitable and remedial ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.758" offset="4046451">That's a fair thing because it places upon each legacy the portion of the estate taxes that where legacy generates.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.737" offset="4090337">Therefore, the Court says that while the testator may direct against apportionment, if he wants to make a direction, his words must be so clear that all doubt as to the extent and limitation of his command must be completely dispelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.327" offset="4192632">I have quoted pretty exactly, I think some language from one of the Connecticut decisions, the common way of expressing the same concept is that the language of the exe -- of the testator must be clear and unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.799" offset="4286568">In the first case that came up in Connecticut, there was a direction on the will, pay all taxes out of the residue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.970" offset="4319274">In that case, it happened that the testator had constructed some inter vivos trusts and a question arose as to whether or not the residuary estate should pay the tax on the inter vivos trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.775" offset="4374444">And the Court said, "No!</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.468" offset="4381236">He hadn't been specific about this."</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.758" offset="4390431">He said all taxes be paid out of the residue but he didn't say that the taxes on the inter vivos trust should be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.710" offset="4430242">Then there is the leading case in Connecticut New York Trust versus Doubleday, where again the testator said, "Pay all of the debt taxes out of the residue."</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.243" offset="4480293">And the same question that arose there arose here.</text>

            <label>Mr. Curtiss K. Thompson</label>
            <text syncTime="1200.095" offset="4903790">Well, the answer to Your Honor's question or as I understand it has really been made by the Court of Appeals of New York where there was a case that is very similar to this that arose in connection with Mr. Schubert's will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.972" offset="4975261">He had a tax clause that directed payment out of the residue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.260" offset="4992397">And the residue of his estate, there were four trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.198" offset="5012146">He made a codicil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.402" offset="5021027">And as a result of a codicil, one more of those trusts became charitable in nature and therefore tax exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.285" offset="5056554">And the question was what effect did his tax clause have after the codicil was executed and these trusts became tax exempted?</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.612" offset="5113814">And the Court of Appeals of New York said that that tax clause could not be read to direct the accomplishment of an object that was totally unnecessary when it was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.775" offset="5194480">In other words, the Schubert wills, there was no occasion for proration between the residuary gifts when the will became exe -- was executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.492" offset="5237321">That became important only after the codicil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.948" offset="5255189">The Schubert decree -- Schubert judgment, opinion had not been decided when the probate judge acted on this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.825" offset="5318719">But it was decided by the time that the -- that this case reached the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.767" offset="5350484">And of course, it's one of the authorities which that court relied upon because of its close similarity to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.927" offset="5399071">Now, the Court of Appeals when the case went there, they didn't recognize and I submit this with all due respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.295" offset="5448600">They didn't recognize the Connecticut law which said that as soon as you have a doubt as to what the testator's intention were with respect to this matter, you do not resolve the doubt by the process of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.264" offset="5536475">Rather you let the apportionment statute operate because that achieves an equitable end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.299" offset="5588616">So the -- the Court of Appeals and my brothers and the Solicitor General's office attempt to circumvent the Connecticut law by the process of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.612" offset="5661863">They do so admittedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.540" offset="5669491">The Court of Appeals characterized its own opinion as one construing the will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.774" offset="5698435">And they did it in such fashion as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.807" offset="5722572">The testator when he executed the codicil had ample opportunity to provide for a special tax treatment for his widow if he chose to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.392" offset="5812955">I don't know on what facts that statement is founded, there's nothing in the record about it, but the important points so far as I am concerned is that it's not special tax treatment for the will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.497" offset="5877321">It's the ordinary tax treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.893" offset="5886934">It's the tax treatment which the legislature of Connecticut said she was entitled to have unless there's this specific direction to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.478" offset="5945240">The Court of Appeals also said, "We don't think that the testator wanted such gross disproportion between his widow's one-third share and the children's."</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.650" offset="6013994">And of course, it doesn't work out on a one-third and two-thirds basis if the children pay all the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.824" offset="6050670">But they don't recognize the other side of the coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.096" offset="6067806">And actually, the converse is that the widow would pay one-third of all the taxes that were generated by the gifts to the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.773" offset="6134471">We feel very strongly that the Court of Appeals decision is in conflict with the established law of Connecticut, the law as established by our own Supreme Court and we ask that the judgment of the Court of Appeals be reversed for that account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.743" offset="6258395">In our reply brief, I mentioned collaterally that we have a situation here where we had a guardian ad litem and we have a probate judge and we have a district judge, all highly experienced and capable Connecticut lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.069" offset="6359646">And they all saw eye-to-eye on this proposition which strikes me as being something pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.168" offset="6404054">I notice my white light is signaled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.924" offset="6435088">The Government here has changed its base a little bit so far as the second question is concerned and the Government itself is now asking that the decision of the Court -- judgment of the Court of Appeals be reversed and sent back for determination as to whether this was an adversary or nonadversary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.243" offset="6528293">I've explained our position on that in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.896" offset="6542921">We feel that the decision of the probate court or the decision of any state court should be respected by the Internal Revenue Service if it is an honest exercise of the judicial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.770" offset="6606451">If it's something less than that, then it's not a good determination of property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.920" offset="6627035">But so long as it determines those property rights knowingly and with an awareness of all the issues, and all the cases that decision so stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.217" offset="6676250">The Government says, "We produce some cases in our footnotes here which were never brought to the attention of the -- of the probate judge."</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.322" offset="6716688">If those cases were of any importance, we might expect to find them cited by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.120" offset="6743855">But out of 11 cases cited by the Government, only one appears in the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.326" offset="6776665">The decisions which the Government is referring to recite the usual tenants of construction about the intent of the testator and so forth and I say seriously that despite the three briefs that had been written on this subject, the Government -- Government's counsel with all their ability have been unable to cite one single case which militates against the decision of the probate court and of the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.430" offset="6905083">I may have save a minute or two for reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.475" offset="6917308">I hope so.</text>

            <text syncTime="2130.953" offset="8627179">Well let me -- let me try to present the issue in the context of a federal tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.707" offset="8654242">This case was simplified facts to show why we think it's unfair to the Commissioner to bind him by a nonadversary decision obtained by the parties who all took one side of an issue, and yet perhaps unfair to the parties to say that the Commissioner will ignore an adversary determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.054" offset="8751626">But it's something that I can illustrate, I think better by using this chart in a simplified version of the facts of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.147" offset="8811917">Now, as I say, this is a simplified version of the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.628" offset="8837935">The estate here is not 12 million but somewhere around 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.747" offset="8850369">But to make the figures work out, I have used the figure 12 million for the estate in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.917" offset="8891016">The question is how much is the widow entitled to receive net under the terms of this will and without any relinquishment of their rights by the other beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.163" offset="8964054">It's quite clear that the marital deduction gives a deduction to the estate for the amount which the widow was entitled to receive under the will, and that any action after the date of death by the other beneficiaries to relinquish their rights and to transfer more property to the widow, then she would have been entitled to receive, had everyone adhered to and demanded their full rights that that cannot increase the marital deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.987" offset="9091323">In other words, if the widow is entitled to receive $2 million and the grandchildren were entitled to receive $4 million under the will as the Commissioner contends, and if the children had said, "No, we renounced our rights as to two extra million dollars so that they'll pass to the widow and she'll get four and we'll get two," it's quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.296" offset="9180557">Now, there's no dispute in this case about this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.544" offset="9193514">It's quite clear that the widow would still only get that the estate would still only get a marital deduction for $2 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.461" offset="9221204">You cannot increase the marital deduction by this activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.752" offset="9234369">Now, under the position taken by the Commissioner which is that the will clearly unequivocally provide that the Connecticut proration statute will not apply, this would be the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.538" offset="9305527">And if you will let me for a moment, I will assume that the Commissioner is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.648" offset="9321932">And then later on, I will argue as I did in the brief what Connecticut law provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.718" offset="9342203">But I don't think that that is -- that the question have general importance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.013" offset="9359444">I will get to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.505" offset="9365400">If the Commissioner is correct, you got in estate of $12 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.090" offset="9383685">You got in estate tax payable of $6 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.794" offset="9394552">Now, I worked that out in advanced because the estate tax depends on the amounts the widow will get.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.213" offset="9416182">And the amounts the widow will get depend on the estate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.693" offset="9426108">There's a simple formula for working it out, it's done all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.987" offset="9439274">I've done it in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.139" offset="9447946">The estate tax will be $6 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.733" offset="9458291">The remainder of $6 million will go as the will provides one-third to the widow or $2 million and two-thirds to the grandchildren or $4 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.353" offset="9504789">The Commissioner then says, "You're entitled to a deduction of $2 million for the marital deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.641" offset="9533942">And your estate tax is therefore $6 million."</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.166" offset="9552018">The petitioner goes into the probate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.024" offset="9567483">Now, I want to make this for this is after the Commissioner has taken his position, issued a 30-day notice of deficiency which is a formal letter stating his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.204" offset="9604159">After that has happened, the Commissioner has made his position clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.562" offset="9621608">Petitioner then goes into probate court and he files, the executor files a document there, requesting that the probate court hold that the will does not unequivocally negates the proration statute, and that the Court therefore holds that the estate be distributed differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.433" offset="9733099">He says, therefore, the widow should get one-third of the estate before any taxes are paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.647" offset="9757968">That is $4 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.696" offset="9770193">Once you determine that the widow gets $4 million that would make the estate tax $5 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.915" offset="9799032">And the remainder that's left over or $3 million would go to the grandchildren.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.816" offset="9818676">Now, here's the will that says one-third to the widow, two-thirds to the grandchildren.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.083" offset="9839679">And under their interpretation, the widow who is getting one-third would end up with more than the grandchildren who were suppose to get two-thirds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.116" offset="9867786">That's a question of Connecticut law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.161" offset="9876041">I think we're quite clearly correct, the Second Circuit agreed but I'm trying to illustrate a broader principle here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.979" offset="9899238">Now, what happens as we see it, when you have this nonadversary proceeding in the probate court where all the parties come in and say, "We agree Your Honor."</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.817" offset="9954617">All the parties come in at filed briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.858" offset="9962768">Their grandchildren -- even though the grandchildren didn't bother to appear the guardian ad litem policy, everybody said to the probate judge, "We have no objection".</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.717" offset="9994219">We agree the pro -- the estate should be divided up like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.984" offset="10011355">What really happens is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.068" offset="10023685">What really happens is that the grandchildren have relinquished a portion of their rights to the extent of $1 million to the widow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.159" offset="10071960">So that they're not getting $4 million anymore, they're getting $3 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.106" offset="10091813">They've transferred a million to the widow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.184" offset="10100067">And the effect of their transferring $1 million to the widow is to give any greater marital deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.752" offset="10130369">And by that effect, to force the Commissioner or the United States to give up an additional $1 million so that what happens is that by the grandchildren consenting to relinquish their rights to the extent of $1 million to the widow, decreasing their -- decreasing their bequest from $4 million to $3 million, increasing her bequest from $2 to $3, they forced the Commissioner if that's adopted, to reduce the estate tax from $6 to $5 and saving to the family is an additional million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.048" offset="10271535">So by transferring, by an intrafamily transfer agreed upon, nobody disputing it, everybody coming in and presenting a uniform position to the probate court by the briefs which don't cite the cases that go the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.045" offset="10327542">Don't make the argument which we make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.007" offset="10335378">By this intrafamily transfer of a million dollars which they disguised by having the probate court, approve it, they in effect cut the estate tax by $1 million.</text>

            <text syncTime="2889.663" offset="11661981">The Government's position was the same and it was formulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.620" offset="11673893">The reason that the Government has taken this position is because an assessment was made over 20 years ago as to whether the Government, United States should attempt to participate in the many, many hundreds perhaps thousands of probate proceedings, declaratory judgment proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.802" offset="11758529">As you'll see in the next case, it was not a probate proceeding in Bosch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.981" offset="11771277">It was sort of a declaratory judgment proceeding in the New York Supreme Court, the trial court there whether the Government should go around the country appearing in the various local courts especially probate courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.626" offset="11821850">And an assessment made of the manpower available, the familiarity of the Government with the procedures in these various courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.454" offset="11853197">You have now 50 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.762" offset="11858422">At that time you had 48 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.856" offset="11866781">You've got a limited amount of manpower.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.133" offset="11875871">You've got the situation where the Government doesn't always know just what's at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.454" offset="11901158">If that rule were that the Government had to participate in all these proceedings, I suppose it would be very simple to amend all the forms so that in addition to giving 50 or 100 relatives notice of every type of hearing that went on in every probate court in the country, you merely added the district director's name.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.063" offset="11971584">And the United States would get notice of all these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.044" offset="11983600">The United States wouldn't come near having the manpower under the existing appropriations, I don't believe, to appear in these proceedings, to take a meaningful part, to ascertain in the flood of mail that would come in carrying notices of proceedings of all kinds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.542" offset="12041592">Which proceedings were meaningful?</text>

            <text syncTime="2987.853" offset="12054758">For that reason, the Commissioner published, put out a release in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.813" offset="12086627">And if I have time, I'll give the history up to 1947 but 1947, he put out a release, in which he said, and Judge Friendly discusses this in a footnote in his dissent in -- in Bosch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.010" offset="12131453">In which the Commissioners said that, "We will not go into these probate court proceedings."</text>

            <text syncTime="3041.135" offset="12267917">Now, if Congress wants to change it to appropriate additional funds, to make available of the additional lawyers that throughout the union in the 50 states so that the Government can appear, I think that's a decision for Congress to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.294" offset="12320580">The Government, the executive branch, doesn't feel that it can do it in the absence of this direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.548" offset="12345553">And that's why we didn't appear in this probate court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.643" offset="12357987">Now, I don't mean to say that the Government has never appeared in a probate court proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="5221.062" offset="20987591">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5226.085" offset="21007757">In this case which presents in slightly different context approximately the same issue as was presented in the Second National Bank case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5237.046" offset="21051538">The decedent died in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="5240.274" offset="21064495">In order to give a complete picture of the case, I have to explain what the decedent did prior to his death and then move up to the situation at his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="5250.408" offset="21105037">In 1930, he created a revocable trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="5255.831" offset="21126666">And that trust is amended in 1931, granted to his wife the income from the trust for her life, and gave her a general power of appointment over the trust assets by her will.</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.640" offset="21221961">If the decedent had died at that point, and if the marital deduction had been enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5287.656" offset="21254040">So assume he died say in 1950, marital deduction have been enacted in 1948, his estate would have received a marital deduction for the value of the assets in that estate, because she was at that time entitled to all of the income generated by the entire trust for her life and she also had a general power of appointment over the trust assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="5315.802" offset="21366575">However, in 1951, that's approximately six years before the decedent died, Congress enacted the Powers of Appointment Act of 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="5327.584" offset="21413700">What that Act said in essence was that anyone who has a general power of appointment which would cause the assets subject to the general power to be crea -- to be taxed in their estate of their death, here that means the widow, may release in toto or in part their general power of appointment without further tax significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5354.834" offset="21522683">So that it enabled someone such as Mrs. Bosch here to release her general power of appointment or to release enough of the general power so as to cut it down to a special power of appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5368.681" offset="21578062">After consulting with the trustee and the bank here involved, Mrs. Bosch took advantage of that option.</text>
            <text syncTime="5375.027" offset="21603453">She executed a release which stated that she released the power to appoint to herself for estate or creditors or the creditors of her estate which are the magic words for a general power of appointment under the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="5390.890" offset="21666983">If that release is effective, she cut her power of appointment from a general power to a special power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5397.520" offset="21693419">Thereafter, six years later in 1957, Mr. Bosch died.</text>
            <text syncTime="5403.372" offset="21716825">So that if the release is effective, all she had at the date of his death was the right to the income from the assets for her life plus a special power of appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5414.365" offset="21760815">Federal law is quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="5416.133" offset="21767920">No one argues with the contrary that if a widow has only income plus special power, no marital deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5424.676" offset="21802088">Commissioner came in, took the position that she was entitled to only a special power of appointment as of the time of Mr. Bosch's death.</text>
            <text syncTime="5434.051" offset="21839600">Therefore, no marital deductions to be allowed with regard to this trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="5437.758" offset="21854438">There was a marital deduction with regard to some other property but not with regard to this trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="5443.336" offset="21876694">After the case was in the tax court, the respondent initiated a suit in the Supreme Court of New York, state trial court, in which the respondent took the position that the Court should declare.</text>
            <text syncTime="5465.772" offset="21966451">Now, this is the respondent in its capacity as trustee of the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="5469.453" offset="21981184">It was the same entity who was also executor of the will.</text>
            <text syncTime="5474.362" offset="22000828">Respondent took the position that the release made in 1951 was invalid under New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.218" offset="22036250">And therefore, the widow still had a general power of appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5488.075" offset="22055685">In that proceeding -- well first of all, the respondent concedes that this suit was prompted by the tax court proceeding, prompted at least in part by the tax court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5503.492" offset="22117334">Three briefs were filed in that proceeding, one by the trustee executor, respondent here; one by the widow, by this time the widow, the life beneficiary; and one by a guardian ad litem or a possible minor beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5520.228" offset="22184312">All three briefs took the same position.</text>
            <text syncTime="5523.758" offset="22198418">All three briefs argued that the six-year old by this time I guess about eight or nine years old release was a nullity, was void.</text>
            <text syncTime="5532.171" offset="22232064">And therefore, that she still had a general power of appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5536.235" offset="22248364">In the tax court in describing this proceeding, counsel for respondent stated as follows in open court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5544.965" offset="22283264">All these briefs, this is page 15 of the record, excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="5549.211" offset="22300191">All these briefs took the same tap; this is counsel for respondent speaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="5553.895" offset="22319000">All these briefs took the same tap, or presented the same side of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.614" offset="22337808">That is this 1951 instrument was a nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5561.897" offset="22350973">And in effect, you have to cut down the general power of appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5565.619" offset="22365811">Thereafter the court, the tax court judge asks this question, "Was the proceeding nonadversary in the sense that no one had any interest in the courts coming out one way or the other?"</text>
            <text syncTime="5576.922" offset="22411055">Counsel for respondent replied, "You might say that that's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5581.531" offset="22429445">In effect, nobody raised the dissenting voice in these proceedings."</text>
            <text syncTime="5587.972" offset="22455254">There were 22 other possible beneficiaries who are in the same position as this minor who've been represented by a guardian ad litem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5595.883" offset="22486915">The other 22 received notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5598.402" offset="22496946">They declined to appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="5599.985" offset="22503320">No appearance was found, the only three briefs with the three arguing that it was a nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5605.427" offset="22525053">The parties in their pleadings in the suit and in the briefs made it quite clear to the state court that a determination that this release was a nullity, we would say the substantial amount of estate tax for the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="5621.045" offset="22587538">In addition, the parties in their briefs failed to cite relevant cases and to make relevant arguments to the Court which would have indicated that the release was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="5636.987" offset="22651277">The Court then adopted their unanimous contention.</text>

            <text syncTime="5924.150" offset="23799933">But I think that it goes first say it's binding on the parties as binding on the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5927.695" offset="23814144">The Second Circuit up until these two decisions had gone along with the majority rule which was the six -- six courts that said nonadversary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5938.484" offset="23857298">The first case, the Second National Bank case, pushed the Second Circuit over at least so far as the Connecticut Probate Court was concerned into the Freuler position never binding.</text>

            <text syncTime="5995.685" offset="24086131">That is to say that the parties just decided that they present this question to the New York Supreme Court for the purpose of contending a determination which would affect tax liability and your adversary of the preceding case, I don't know if this is right or not, suggested that the Connecticut Probate Court in the ordinary course of its administration had to decide the issue which affected tax liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="6044.243" offset="24280377">What makes this case so easy is that the state court proceeding had no significant purpose other than the reduction of tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="6052.139" offset="24311933">Mrs. Bosch was not shown to have the slightest intention of using the general power the New York Court was led to thrust upon her.</text>

            <text syncTime="6068.614" offset="24377866">Well, I don't think it makes any difference whether you call a decision a regular decision, one that the parties had to seek or whether you say that they went out and got a decision they didn't need.</text>
            <text syncTime="6083.577" offset="24437635">Respondent in this case argues that their decision was one that they had to seek.</text>

            <text syncTime="6095.492" offset="24485386">Now, in the process of getting this accounting which of course was prompted by the existing federal tax case, we also presented the issue to the Court of whether this was a general or a special power which is the issue of whether the release was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="6109.578" offset="24541706">Now, of course they say, "We had to get a ruling on this at some time because the widow might have exercised the power.</text>

            <text syncTime="6260.887" offset="25146911">That he should not determine the issue at anytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="6265.645" offset="25165928">That the issue should be determined by a state court unless it's a nonadversary proceeding, isn't that right?</text>
            <text syncTime="6277.133" offset="25211904">That is you don't take the position that the question which affects the marital deduction is one that is properly accorded determination by the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="6287.710" offset="25254222">Do you take the position that it should be determined in adversary state court proceeding?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack S.Levin</label>
            <text syncTime="6292.818" offset="25274598">No, if that's -- it's a question perhaps of emphasis, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6296.761" offset="25290376">In the typical run of the mind case, the vast majority case, you had no state proceeding whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="6303.365" offset="25316812">The vast majority of the cases that come up in the federal court, the state court hasn't determined the state issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6307.980" offset="25335306">And you have the federal courts setting to litigate tax issues, deciding state issues all the time, applying the Erie doctrine and saying now, "What is the law of Connecticut on this point or the trust law?"</text>
            <text syncTime="6318.445" offset="25377102">It happens that an income tax cases, estate tax cases, every kind of tax case, they typically decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6324.354" offset="25400822">It's the infrequent case where the parties in the process of a tax dispute true brought to the state court and ask the state court to give them a decree which they can then go back to the federal court and waive and say, "See, the state court has decided this precise issue and we are now bound by it, and you should be."</text>
            <text syncTime="6345.835" offset="25486712">That doesn't happen except in a very small percentage of the cases.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="6349.528" offset="25501445">Well, that may be a little overstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6352.668" offset="25514088">I don't know what matter it is which adversary now the case, the preceding case said that the Connecticut Probate Court decision came by in ordinary course, and there has been judgment of as whether they get it or did not.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack S.Levin</label>
            <text syncTime="6368.820" offset="25578663">Well, I assume it did come about in ordinary course.</text>
            <text syncTime="6371.520" offset="25589426">But very frequently the estate waits until the federal government has determined the estate tax and made these determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6379.288" offset="25620564">Then they go back to the state court with the federal government's determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6383.428" offset="25637073">If they want to litigate it, they litigate it in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6386.047" offset="25647522">They don't try to jump the gun so to speak and to get the Connecticut Probate Court to rule in advance as to how you allocate federal estate taxes when the federal estate taxes haven't been computed yet and they're engage in a dispute with the Commissioner over and to do that, especially in a nonadversary proceeding where everyone files briefs pointing the same way, and leaves out the decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6407.551" offset="25733622">The reason that we think that the question of nonadversary is a relevant one is because for one thing, there could arise a case, I don't know of a single one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6419.101" offset="25779806">But there could arise a case whether it has actually been litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6423.424" offset="25797047">And the parties have resolved the disputes for litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6426.914" offset="25811048">The Court has reached the decision which is close but perhaps later proves to be erroneous on closer examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="6433.538" offset="25837484">And in that sort of a case, it seems rather unfair for the Commissioner to refuse, to accept that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="6440.315" offset="25864652">But in the case where the parties make no effort in -- in this case that the other beneficiaries in the Second National Bank case, the grandchildren, make no effort to assert their obvious rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6453.209" offset="25916165">But rather by their whole demeanor and their position, they show that they are relinquishing their rights without a fight.</text>
            <text syncTime="6460.195" offset="25944168">It's really no different than if they are giving away their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6465.093" offset="25963708">And the Commissioner shouldn't be required to treat it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6467.240" offset="25972381">And now you can go to full -- to full extent and say, "Well because that sort of a determination is difficult to make whether it was adversary or nonadversary, we will hold the state trial court or probate court decision as never binding."</text>

            <text syncTime="6497.431" offset="26093066">Judge Raum here had a situation where the tax court had unanimously along with six of the circuits adopted fairly unanimously adopted the nonadversary view through the years, long history back beginning as early as 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="6514.296" offset="26160567">And he knew that that the Courts of Appeals at least the Third Circuit had disagreed.</text>

            <text syncTime="6525.066" offset="26203617">He ends his position by his -- his opinion by saying that he need not determine whether the decision is binding on him or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="6547.335" offset="26292746">And earlier in his opinion, he characterizes Blair against the Commissioner as standing for the proposition that in general where the operation of the federal tax law turns upon a nature of property interest created under state law and adjudication by a state court in respect to the very property interest involved is final where that Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter, and the proceeding is not collusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="6570.736" offset="26386265">And he says that's the rule I'm going to accept first.</text>

            <text syncTime="6572.965" offset="26395251">He ends his opinion with these two sentences on page 24 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6577.347" offset="26412805">Nor is it necessary to say that we are bound by the New York decision, it is sufficient merely the state that in a foregoing circumstances we accept the New York decision as an authoritative exposition of New York law and the adjudication of the property rights involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6591.314" offset="26468603">Now, I can't do anymore than to read that and try to interpret it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6596.245" offset="26488351">He said he doesn't feel himself bound but then he goes on to say something that doesn't seem quite consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6602.407" offset="26513011">That of course, as I've said, is a departure from the view of the tax court long held.</text>
            <text syncTime="6610.065" offset="26543626">The history and perhaps what help it by very briefly sketch out the history of this from the earliest indications of congressional intention on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6620.280" offset="26584482">And that, there as follows, in 1919, long before the marital deduction had been enacted, the Commissioner promulgated regulations under what is now Section 2053 of the Code, we've set the regulations for.</text>
            <text syncTime="6631.705" offset="26630144">The question there is does the estate get a deduction for a claim against the estate?</text>
            <text syncTime="6638.411" offset="26656998">In other words, a probate court determines Mr. X is a creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6642.267" offset="26672462">Mr. X happens to be the testator's son.</text>
            <text syncTime="6644.530" offset="26681448">Do they get a deduction for that if he was a genuine creditor that gets a deduction?</text>
            <text syncTime="6648.584" offset="26697749">Some people had go into probate courts and the logical beneficiary would come in and say, "My father really owed me $400,000 so please distribute it to me as creditor rather than his beneficiary."</text>
            <text syncTime="6658.195" offset="26736201">There have been decisions to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6660.309" offset="26744560">So the 1919 regulations under that section indicate that the Commissioner will not accept the decision that Mr. X is a creditor unless it was -- it was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="6670.762" offset="26786461">If it was wrong, it won't be accepted unless it was litigated adversary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6676.327" offset="26808717">Then in 1926 in the Krause case, the tax court for the first time had a -- that sort of a question before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6684.946" offset="26843199">And it indicated that it was going along with this sort of reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="6689.559" offset="26861589">And the tax court decisions thereafter up until this one are fairly well along that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="6695.336" offset="26884681">The next relevant guide post is the Brainard decision by the Seventh Circuit in 1937 so far as I know the first Court of Appeal decision on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6705.816" offset="26926686">We quote from that in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6707.794" offset="26934523">That decision can be read two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="6710.368" offset="26944867">It can be read as supporting either the so-called Erie view was never bound or the adversary view.</text>
            <text syncTime="6716.042" offset="26967542">The Court says, "This is a decision of Cook County, Illinois Circuit Court."</text>
            <text syncTime="6724.278" offset="27000456">We're not bound by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6725.301" offset="27004531">There are lots of courts but they went out of their way to point out the circuit court decision from Cook County was a proceeding between this man and his wife, and mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="6735.346" offset="27044760">And he ends with the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6738.112" offset="27055835">It is no doubt true that the preferred decree is binding up on the parties to that suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6742.265" offset="27072449">And it will not be appealed from because all the parties thereto are satisfied with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6746.873" offset="27090840">So this 1937 decision contains the germs of the nonadversary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="6750.870" offset="27106826">He's saying it was a proceeding between the man, his mother, and his wife, and nobody appealed because everybody was satisfied with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6757.810" offset="27134621">That in 1940, the Third Circuit, the circuit is now against this, in the Mechanics Bank case also adopted the same sort of a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="6766.787" offset="27170565">And of course was subsequently departed from.</text>
            <text syncTime="6768.904" offset="27179029">In 1947, the Commissioner published disposition that he's not going to go in and litigate the state probate courts and trial courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6776.424" offset="27209017">Then in this context, in 1948, one year after this pronounced by the Commissioner, Congress enacts the marital deduction provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6787.061" offset="27251649">And Congress in the legislative history says that in interpreting the question in whether you get a marital deduction as to an interpretation of the will.</text>
            <text syncTime="6795.724" offset="27286235">How much does the widow entitled to under the will if she had enforced her rights and everyone had enforced their rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="6801.900" offset="27311000">Congress said this in the legislative history cited on page 16 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6806.527" offset="27329494">In this connection, proper regard should be given to interpretations of the will rendered by a court in a bona fide adversary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6818.445" offset="27377142">Later on in that same page, Congress went on to say; that a settlement between the parties is not binding on the Commissioner will not be accepted even if it sets the party's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6831.556" offset="27429595">Now, in this context, one year later, the Commissioner enacted regulations under the marital deduction provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6839.829" offset="27462719">It was set forth in the appendix to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6841.854" offset="27470764">These regulations, very much like the 1919 regulations for claims against the estate indicate that the Commissioner is not bound unless you have a proceeding in a state trial court rendered on the merits in an adversary proceeding following a genuine and act of contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6863.781" offset="27558536">At that point, the litigation is still going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6868.117" offset="27575881">1954, of course Congress reenacted the marital deduction provision in this context of what I think clear legislative history, clear and uniform proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="6880.126" offset="27623842">In 1955, a year later, the Third Circuit decides the Gallagher case in which it overrules in effect its older cases, and decides that from now on, the Commissioner is bound by a nonadversary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6894.791" offset="27682565">The Third Circuit went so far as in the Beecher case decided a short time later to say that where the sons and daughters came in and said, "We're really creditors and sought quickly to prove their claims against the estate that's binding on the Commissioner."</text>

            <text syncTime="6914.496" offset="27761351">The state proceedings below were not adversary proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="6921.152" offset="27787995">Now, I think it is a fair statement by Judge Friendly that the primary purpose of the state court proceeding was to effect estate taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6934.221" offset="27840240">But let us examine the situation in which the trustee found itself when its counsel suggested to it that the release, purported release of the power of appointment by the wife, may not have been valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="6952.700" offset="27914219">It sounded very patriotic thing I suppose for trustee to give up the assets of the estate to the federal government, but it's unlawful for their standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="6963.915" offset="27959045">And no matter having been called to his attention, he had to have a resolution of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6969.156" offset="27980048">He sought this -- he sought this resolution by an action or an accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="6979.323" offset="28020694">That action was pending when the tax court proceedings was pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="6984.599" offset="28041801">The tax court granted a stay of the tax court proceedings pending the outcome of this state court proceeding which was to be determined at due of the property rights involved in the estate tax proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="7002.085" offset="28111705">But there's no way of vouching the Commissioner and has been suggested a Commissioner 20 years ago said that he would not participate in any proceedings even to protect this on the federal fist.</text>
            <text syncTime="7014.251" offset="28160397">And I heard the argument before this case in which he didn't want to come in to protect one million dollars in taxes, I thought that perhaps he could afford to employ lawyers but I -- I'm not going to suggest that I'm better than administrator than he.</text>
            <text syncTime="7031.720" offset="28230301">But it seems to me that if he had an opportunity to litigate the issue in the state court, he should have taken advantage of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7043.323" offset="28276694">Now, in the state court proceeding, there was no arrangement between the judge and the trustee as has been suggested not in our case but in possibly other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="7060.093" offset="28343777">The matter was submitted to him for his -- the court's independent determination upon briefs or be it all supporting the same proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="7072.863" offset="28394872">The trustee couldn't find another adversary to make this an adversary proceeding if he wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="7079.075" offset="28419636">There wasn't anybody who would contest the issue even the guardian ad litem for the infant.</text>
            <text syncTime="7086.634" offset="28449938">It was a matter of indifference to him whether the release was valid or invalid because if it was valid, the wife had a special power of appointment that he could have appointed to the infant.</text>

            <text syncTime="8262.341" offset="33152711">First is that the law of the 50 states is not at all clear but the United States has the right to intervene in every conceivable type of proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="8272.254" offset="33192417">We haven't had time to research the law of all the states but at least in Connecticut, it certainly not clear that the United States could have come in to this probate court, intervene, obtain the right to appeal about if the decisions were against it, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="8286.966" offset="33251244">This is something that's rather tricky and rather difficult even if the United States wanted to go in even if Congress appropriated all the money so that we could go in and hire the requisite attorneys to be present in all these states to appear in these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="8300.746" offset="33306311">Second in this case, the Court of Appeals did not decide the question of New York law as I explained for the majority decline to decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="8310.657" offset="33346017">And what I take it respondent is saying is that even if there were a decision of the New York Court of Appeals directly contrary to its position which had not been cited by any party to the New York Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8324.840" offset="33402755">And the reason it had not been cited is because nobody was presenting that position but that that they had gone in there and wait --</text>
