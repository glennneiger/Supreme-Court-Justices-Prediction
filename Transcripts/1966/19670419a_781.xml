        <section startTime="0" stopTime="1318.018">
          <heading>Argument of Arnold Ordman</heading>

            <label>Mr. Arnold Ordman</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- appeals for the Fifth Circuit which denied enforcement to a board order.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.758" offset="134353">The Board's order was based on a finding that the employer, Great Dane Trailers, Inc. violated Section 8 (a) (1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act by denying payment of previously earned vacation benefits to strikers who elected to remain on strike or who had been replaced while paying such benefits to nonstrikers and strikers who abandoned the strike and returned to work by a certain date.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.513" offset="265383">The court below denied enforcement to the Board's order on the ground that this disparity of treatment, notwithstanding the return on strike activity was not unlawful despi -- absent, an independent showing or an illegal motive on the part of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.985" offset="347303">Now, the record is devoid of evidence that apart from the disparity of treatment itself, the employer had a subjective intent to penalize the employees for their strike activity.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="73.590" stopTime="75.456">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="73.590" offset="397772">That's the common ground in this opinion.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arnold_ordman" startTime="75.456" stopTime="306.050">
            <label>Mr. Arnold Ordman</label>
            <text syncTime="75.456" offset="405191">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.779" offset="410520">And the question presented here is whether such independent evidence of subjective intent is in the circumstances here presented a pre-conditioned or finding of unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.577" offset="469661">Now, before stating the facts, I think it would be helpful to note very briefly that we see the issue in this case as paralleling the issue in Erie Resistor.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.738" offset="510307">In that case, as the Court will recall, the employer awarded super seniority, super seniority to replacements and returning strikers as against those who remained on strike and the question presented there as here was whether you would had to have an independent showing of an intent to penalize strikers, has a precondition to finding an unfair labor practice in that case and this Court held that such a showing was not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.908" offset="634964">Now, Great Dane Trailers, Inc. manufactures truck trailers in this plant in south, I mean its plant at Savannah, Georgia through its employees for some years have been presented by the Boilermakers Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.132" offset="687940">The most recent collective bargaining agreement between the company and the union was for a three-year period which expired in March 31st, 1963 and was terminable thereafter upon proper notice by either of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.421" offset="753037">Now, so far as relevant here, that agreement provided that employees with more than 60 days of service, would receive annual vacation pay on the Friday nearest July 1 of each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.222" offset="824299">Those who had worked at least 1525 hours or approximately 38 weeks, the proceeding year would receive a weeks vacation pay and for those who work less, in as little actually as a 169 hours, they got a diminished scale of payments which was actually set forth in the contract for those who work fewer hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.387" offset="916877">Now, employees who had at least five years or more of continuous employment to the company got double paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.177" offset="948120">But the agreement specifically provided that those workers who quit or were laid off were otherwise terminated even during the course of the year and didn't survived until July 1st nevertheless would get pay if they had worked the minimum 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.126" offset="1027845">On April 30th, 1963, the union gave timely notice to terminate the agreement as of May 16, approximately two weeks later.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.063" offset="1071626">And on May 16th, the union went out on an economic strike to support its bargaining demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.114" offset="1099839">And about 348, I believe, of the company's 400 employees joined the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.103" offset="1127737">Now, within a matter of six weeks, by July 1st, about 259 of the 350 strikers had been replaced and a few of the other strikers went back to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.130" offset="1183848">The strike, however, continued for several months longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.383" offset="1196910">But early in July, about 300 of the strikers individually and through their union, asked the company for the vacation pay they had earned under their agreement which had now been terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.197" offset="1256155">The company replied by a letter, which was dated July 12 and says -- said in effect, “Because you, the union, have terminated the agreement, there isn't any provision for vacation pay in effect and suggested that may be that matter could be taken up at the bargaining negotiations.”</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="306.050" offset="1327522">Well, that was true the agreement was no longer in effect and it was only because of the agreement that they had any right to vacation pay as of July 1st, isn't that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="318.113" offset="1375796">That was a working condition set up by the agreement but under the terms of the agreement and while it was in effect, this right had accrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.994" offset="1407352">This was work pay they had during the period of the agreement.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="363.533" offset="1557504">So that remains an issue between the parties, is it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arnold_ordman" startTime="365.034" stopTime="810.590">
            <label>Mr. Arnold Ordman</label>
            <text syncTime="365.034" offset="1563460">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.318" offset="1576626">Now, the company -- their company suggested that this matter might be resolved at the bargaining table, which is also in the record an indication they suggest that this might be resolved by an independent lawsuit under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.044" offset="1627512">Now, needless to have at this point, there weren't any bargaining negotiations so far as the record shows on this issue but -- and I think it is a matter of law and not in dispute that the employees couldn't be forced to bargain away any contract rights or statutory rights which they have or which had accrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.961" offset="1703267">Now, shortly thereafter, in August -- and this was in July -- in August, the company did make vacation payments to all the nonstrikers and to those strikers, who had abandoned the strike before July 1st, and had not been -- and had not been replaced but the returning strikers even those who returned who were replaced and those who elected to continue to exercise their statutory right to strike, received no vacation pay even though under the -- during the existence of the contract their right to vacation pay had accrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.751" offset="1842343">Now, the company defended its action before the Board on the ground that the payments were made, that the payments that were made were made not under the contract which has been terminated but under a unilateral policy which it said that it adopted following the termination of the contract but it concedes, and these are its own words, that the unilateral policy incorporated substantially the same conditions as to the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.239" offset="1944325">Now, as for its refusal to make payments to those who continued on strike and to replace strikers, it simply explained that, well there was a break in the length of service and the employees who weren't -- didn't get paid were not working as of July 1st and the strikers who were replaced weren't employees at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.317" offset="2020603">Now, the Board found that by denying this vacation pay, the strikers who would not abandon the strike or had been replaced, the company discriminated against them because of their adherence to the strike, their continued exercise of the right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.188" offset="2080162">Now, whether the company made its selection of who got paid and who didn't get paid, pursuant to the contract provisions or pursuant to its unilateral policy which have formulated after the contract terminated, the Board said this was really immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.252" offset="2144423">They're not under the Board's holding, it stated, was that under the law, strikers have to be treated uniformly with nonstrikers with the relation to whatever benefits accrued to them from their employment relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.342" offset="2208789">In this connection, incidentally, the Board did order that the strikers be awarded back pay but it specifically excluded any compu -- that computation of the back pay due them anytime in which they were not working and which they were on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.313" offset="2268662">The Board incidentally also agreed and this is agreed that there wasn't any independent subjective evidence of disparity of treat -- of intent to penalize strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.491" offset="2309308">Now, the court below disagreed with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.674" offset="2322056">Before the court below, we urged the Erie Resistor principle and the court below made no mention of Erie Resistor.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.932" offset="2347133">Instead, it cited the more recent decision of this Court in the American Ship Building case and it said that the American Ship Building case stands for the proposition that if the employers conduct carries with it any other inference, any other inference of a legitimate motive, the inference of illegality which would otherwise bring does not control.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.514" offset="2457475">Now, the Court recognized that the record in the case before it, did not disclose any such legitimate motive and I take it that means that it rejected the reasons the company gave it before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.957" offset="2503241">It said the record doesn't disclose any legitimate motive but the court below itself suggested legitimate motives which might have motivated the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.329" offset="2544724">For example, it suggested that may be the company did what it did to reduce expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.046" offset="2571577">Maybe it did it to encourage longer tenure among the present employees or may be it did it to discourage early leave before vacation periods and because the court below said because these motivations may have existed and the court below concluded that the Board was required to and failed to establish of the company's action were prompted by some independent motive to penalize the strikers and the court denied the petition for enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.137" offset="2695920">Now, there is some subordinate matters to which I think are adequately covered in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.696" offset="2714206">I'd like to reach what I think is the overriding issue, whether the interpretation put by the court below on the American Ship decision and its apparent rejection of -- we think its apparent rejection of the Erie Resistor principles applied to the fact of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.974" offset="2787244">Now, we think the Court of Appeals here as an Erie Resistor, erred in holding that in the absence of a finding of a specific illegal intent, a legitimate business purpose is always a defense to an unfair labor practice charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.992" offset="2859342">Now, the court below doesn't, this Court does not and we do not again say the relevance and the importance and even then the necessity in 8 (a) (3) cases of showing an employer's intent or motive to discriminate or to interfere with union rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.001" offset="2943352">But as Radio Officers has established, specific evidence of such subjective intent is in Justice Reed's language not an indispensable element of proof of violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.675" offset="2998105">Now, such evidence is required, of course, in the typical situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.206" offset="3016182">Take the normal discharge case which still is a large portion of the National Labor Relations Board work.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.194" offset="3048155">There, many otherwise innocent or even ambiguous actions which are normally incident of the conduct of -- an employer's conduct of his business are exempt from the Act's stretches, unless specific intent of -- specific evidence of a subjective intent to discriminate or encourage or discourage union activity as shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.566" offset="3137599">Now, this requirement is imposed because there's nothing in the nature of a conduct itself in the normal discharge case; there's nothing in the conduct itself which necessarily and foreseeably evinces a discriminatory purpose or effect of which is inconsistent with the employer's normal operation of his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.955" offset="3227146">But we suggest that this category of cases has to be distinguished from the much smaller category and this Court has done so from the last frequent type of case typified by Radio Officers, by Erie Resistor and we believe this case, where the necessary foundation of discriminatory intent derives from what this Court has called the “inherently discriminatory” or destructive nature of the conduct itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1005.898" offset="4127013">But this Court has suggested in Erie Resistor there are countervailing considerations; there could be a legitimate motive, a legitimate objective which would overweigh the discriminatory intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.693" offset="4174137">Now, without dwelling on it too much, I simply say that there are cases and we have cited some of these illustrative situations on page 12 of our brief where a legitimate business consideration can override the discriminatory intent which is inherent in the conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.385" offset="4244877">But certainly, the company presented none as the Board below found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.192" offset="4268178">And even assuming that the court as it did itself speculate as to what might have been the reason and it supplied this reasons, the company did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.238" offset="4308302">We suggest that even that -- even if that were proper, the speculative reasons the court below assigned don't carry the ball because this Board -- the Board did weigh these considerations and in its judgment under this Court whether that judgment is certainly subject to the review by the courts and by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.625" offset="4389909">But this Court has suggested that there must be a little circumspection attending court review of that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.778" offset="4418435">Now, we find nothing in American Ship which is inconsistent with Erie Resistor and we think to the extent this Court mentioned the Erie Resistor principle in American Ship and it did cite that case for we think it specifically indorsed Erie Resistor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.473" offset="4493249">Now, the bulk of the respondent's argument here really is that the impact of vacation pay, this case is different from Erie Resistor because the impact of withholding vacation pay benefits even though a term and condition applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1338.420" offset="5457063">Now, this company had dealt with this union from a period of more than 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.951" offset="5475140">The record is devoid of any problems, any unfair labor practices and the only thing we can assume is that company and the union throughout these years had adjusted their problems among themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.685" offset="5522160">In this case itself, there's no finding of any independent unfair labor practices to cloud the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.555" offset="5557582">So we have in this case a sterile labor atmosphere other than this one incident and we have the laboratory conditions that the Board strives to get when they consider a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.120" offset="5611813">It's been our view, since this case originated, that this is a primarily a suit for money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.709" offset="5638248">It stood by the Board as the improper forum to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.704" offset="5654235">We urged from the beginning that if they felt that this vacation money was due to these employees that the proper forum was to the Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act which is set out for this purpose to test rights under contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1904.823" offset="7722715">Now, before this, I think we have to take this a step further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.350" offset="7736822">Now, before this vacation plan was instituted around the middle of August, 325 out of the 348 strikers had been replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.941" offset="7771094">So you have a -- you have only 23 unrep -- have not been replaced at the time the vacation plan was instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.569" offset="7809651">Now, how can the Board say that the institution of this vacation plan at this time called these people who had been replaced and had no re-employment rights to lose their interest in the union as they represented in this plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.362" offset="7880808">Now, keeping in mind too that this vacation plan unlike Erie did not attract anybody to leave the strike and join the company because it had a retroactive effective date, which mean that after they heard the plan and went to work, that they wouldn't be affected by the plan at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.490" offset="7957295">So this is not like Erie at all, the facts or situation of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.413" offset="7977044">This is not made for the purpose of inducing people to break the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.455" offset="7989164">They come in because they had already been replaced or returned prior to any effective time of the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.074" offset="8023646">Now, vacation plans are not like super seniority plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.154" offset="8035976">This is an unusual -- the super seniority was unusual remedy that the company used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.952" offset="8059173">Vacation plans were accepted and they were facet of employer-employee relationship whether you have a union or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.239" offset="8096371">So that all the company did in this instance was to put in the same vacation plan in August that they have offered the union and had been rejected by which the Board will concede we had a right to do with any, during the bargain, at any offer that we made the union in a way of a benefit, wage and hours that we have a right have a new bias and during the strike to institute those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.271" offset="8184456">Now, let's assume that we had made 20-cent an hour increase.We could have put that into the nonstrikers until the replacements and this to me is this is just discriminatory against the strikers as such as this vacation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.777" offset="8254464">Yet this is accepted and the Board will not use this as a basis of a discriminatory charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.392" offset="8284975">We've put in the charge plan, that's been offered, and the union rejected.</text>

            <text syncTime="2095.437" offset="8485073">Now, the -- as been stated here, this matter was suggested to the union as a matter of the vacation pay on the expired contract or cancelled contract should be discussed and as the record shows, there is no record that the union ever discussed it or brought the matter up again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.479" offset="8581308">Now, from the above, the Board found that we agree with the trial examiners that the denial of vacation pay to strikers who had not abandoned the strike by July 1st, 1963 unlawfully discriminate against them because of their errands to union strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.781" offset="8650480">Now, we're talking about they're making it as option in the face of a plan which did not come into effect for six weeks after this and at which time, more than 325 of the 348 strikers had been replaced and lawfully discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.712" offset="8722265">So we say that this is -- there is no basis for this finding in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.183" offset="8748074">The court below in considering this case noted that the Board had found that this vacation plan which is what had been offered to the union and rejected by them and then put it back in August of 1963 to be an ipso facto per se violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.151" offset="8835950">And frankly, gentlemen, the Court just couldn't buy that type of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.435" offset="8857161">The Court considered the respondent's conduct, carries with it an inference of an unlawful intention, so compelling that it is just fine to disbelieve what the company testified about this and the Court said we've looked at this case from the American Ship Building point of view and we just can't find it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.235" offset="8944306">Now, the Court further said that when viewed in a strong evidence showing otherwise exemplary conduct on the part of the company, the argument fairing the inference of illegality becomes increasingly weaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.694" offset="9018180">And the Board still argued Erie Resistor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.550" offset="9025599">As I pointed out, to me there's no factual basis by which these cases can be even argued together, Erie Resistor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.970" offset="9063215">The plan was put in for the purpose of breaking a strike and it succeeded from the -- were found in the record in doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.310" offset="9088606">As far as this case is concerned, the strike had been disposed off before the plan had been put in effect and it would not have affected anyone who came to work after the plan had been announced because there was retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.753" offset="9146389">Now, the desired position, and we still submit, that the findings of the Court of Appeals below is correct and that the findings to that court should be affirmed here on appeal.</text>
