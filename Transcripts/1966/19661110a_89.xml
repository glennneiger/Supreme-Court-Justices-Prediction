            <text syncTime="38.368" offset="256815">Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.985" offset="279280">I'd like to review for just a moment the factual situation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.980" offset="303313">Roy Walker was employed by the Southern Railroad sometime in 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.291" offset="324524">In -- on March 3, 1957, he was informed that he had been displaced by an employee with greater seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.215" offset="356185">He then informed the call clerk that he was sick and was going home.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.806" offset="374575">He went home and on April the 29th, a letter was directed to him to report for duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.188" offset="408116">In between these times, it was contended by Mr. Walker that he had informed the railroad of his illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.187" offset="440090">This record said, “Dear sir, I understand you were displaced from the regular job at airline junction March 3, 1957 and I was yourself since?</text>
            <text syncTime="93.088" offset="475721">This is to advise you that you stand for work in your seniority and unless you protect your seniority standing within 30 days from the date of this letter, you will have opted your seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.862" offset="518771">Yours very truly, Superintendent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="106.291" offset="528488">That letter was dated April the 29th in Greenville, South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.384" offset="552939">It was signed for May the 30th by Mr. Walker's daughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.657" offset="569971">He was on the hospital at the time and didn't have knowledge of it for four days.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.280" offset="608528">He then went down on May the 29th to report for duty and discovered that his name had been stricken from the seniority list because he had not reported in 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.934" offset="659101">This is actually the turning point of the wrongfulness of the discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.802" offset="686582">They told him he couldn't go to work that he had been fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.008" offset="699434">He went to see the superintendent the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.971" offset="707271">The Superintendent of that division, Mr. Brad and in this connection, there has been some suggestion here that taken a man's seniority doesn't fire him, if this is just a grievance or some technical situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="165.194" offset="764113">Well, the day after he reported and was told that his seniority was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.109" offset="783757">The Superintendent of the Railroad wrote him this letter, he reported this letter was written to him on the -- on the -- “Please refer to my letter dated April the 29, 1957, advising you to protect your seniority within 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.202" offset="844152">You did not report and protect your seniority as instructed and this is stood by you that under the provisions of fireman's agreement and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.769" offset="874454">Your name has been stricken from the firemen seniority list and you are no longer considered an employee of the Southern Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.757" offset="906428">Please turn in all company property you have in your possession to train met -- to Terminal Train Master Curly.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.294" offset="940596">Now, there's no question I think that Roy Walker was fired and he was fired because the railroad said he didn't protect his seniority within 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.250" offset="996394">We tried this case in the Western District Court before Judge Craven and Judge Craven found this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.745" offset="1026382">Walker reported for work on May 29, 1957, it is adjudged that this was the last day of the 30-day period within which he was required to report.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.488" offset="1073298">Southern for job his seniority as of May 28, 1957 was therefore unlawful and constituted a violation of his contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.504" offset="1113422">So we have a finding of fact by the trial court, we tried it before Judge Craven to the effect that Walker was wrongfully discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.822" offset="1150621">Now then at this juncture, I want to call the Court's attention to one of the thing I refer to it again later.</text>

            <text syncTime="429.189" offset="1820087">So we have here actually, the Union that Mr. Walker paid his dues to that he relied upon saying to the Director of Labor Relations of the Southern Railroad, I want you to leave him fired when the Director had suggested that he be rehired.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.761" offset="1886438">Now, Mr. Walker came to me to know what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.365" offset="1908799">He knew that the General Chairman of the Union didn't like him and he knew that he couldn't get his job back through the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.759" offset="1938369">We didn't have these letters at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.228" offset="1944325">It took a lot of adverse examinations before the Southern Railroad to come up with these two letters with this exchange of letters between the Union and the Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.834" offset="1986748">And so, I brought a notion in rather for county court the wrongful discharged and ask for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.942" offset="2019140">Now as a matter of fact, this is not in the record but as a matter of fact it went six years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.615" offset="2033873">I brought it within a three-year statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.236" offset="2044322">But I had so many motions to strike and so many -- and so many demurrers and so many procedure difficulties in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.952" offset="2071176">We can take a non-suit and bring the action again within a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.186" offset="2088103">And rather in the preliminary skirmishing of going through the appeals and back in appeals and back in North Carolina, I simply non-suit in my compliant and made it conform to what the Railroad said out to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.920" offset="2131048">And that's the reason it looks like it was six years before we brought it.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.775" offset="2146513">Mr. Walker came to me and we brought an action for wrongful discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.619" offset="2169814">They removed it to the federal court and we were successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.499" offset="2185383">Eight days after that, this Court decided the Republic Steel against Maddox and the Railroad gave notice to the appeal to the Circuit, and I gave notice of appeal on matter of mitigation of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.199" offset="2236165">I think we really come down to this in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.394" offset="2252988">The federal government has a labor policy and I think the essential question is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.911" offset="2282977">When a discharged -- when a man is wrongfully discharged and his discharged is treated by him as fine, does that take his case outside of the purview of the federal labor policy?</text>

            <text syncTime="624.756" offset="2602402">Now in the Lincoln Mills case, this Court there properly I think said that it was the obligation of the federal government to make a body of law concerning labor relations because you have labor acts and you regulate the labor, the railroads and the other labor act and it is obligation of the federal government to make a body of law governing labor relations when the Congress pays it acts for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.191" offset="2704175">And so in Lincoln Mills, you said that, that the federal government had jurisdiction regardless of diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.939" offset="2731133">And we come on down from that to whole a lot of other cases which I think are perfectly properly saying that when you have a national labor policy and the courts are going to be obligated to implement it and they're going to be obligated to decide cases under it, you come to the question of whether that National Labor Policy should be governed by strictly federal law as enunciated by the federal courts or whether in certain places it should be governed by the state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2777.297" offset="11212570">They pointed out that such action should await the case under the Railway Labor Act in which the distinctive features of the administrative remedies could be considered in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.727" offset="11266278">We submit that in analysis of the administrative remedies that are available through the procedures of the Adjustment Board are essentially the same as the procedures that are available in the routine labor arbitration context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.089" offset="11343705">The procedures are informal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.990" offset="11355303">The scope of review is limited to just about the same degree both by reason of this Court's decision in Gunther and in other cases and a recent amendment to the Railway Labor Act which reinforces this Court's decisions dealing with the scope of review from Adjustment Board decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.926" offset="11443075">The -- the remedies that are available to an employee in proceeding before the Adjustment Board are certainly no less than remedies available in ordinary arbitration procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.821" offset="11506604">Indeed, they're probably more flexible as this Court itself is aware from the facts in Gunther case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.954" offset="11543176">That is a great deal of flexibility in terms of a point in -- of doctors and so on to examine the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.294" offset="11572537">But under the procedures of the Adjustment Board reinstatement as possible, back pay awards are possible, so that the summons substance is that there is no significant difference between ordinary labor arbitrations of the type that would have been involved in Maddox had the employee there exhausted his contractual remedies and the procedures provided for under the Railway Labor Act if an employee resorts to or a Union resorts to the Adjustment Board.</text>
