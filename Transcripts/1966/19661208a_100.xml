            <label>Mr. Wade H. Penny, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="19.000" offset="179388">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.618" offset="201853">This case is before this Court on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.071" offset="235708">That court in a decision rendered in January of this year held that the State of North Carolina acting through its solicitor and the trial court made by procedural device known under North Carolina law as a nolle prosequi with leave permanently and completely deprived by criminal defendant of his day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.059" offset="355558">At this point, I would like to emphasize that although discussion of the right to a speedy trial normally proceeds from a concern with what is an unreasonable delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.094" offset="411773">Here, the State of North Carolina takes the unprecedented, we submit, view that the state may permanently and completely deprive a defendant of his day in court and in doing so repudiates the basic principle of our system of law that every man accused to crime regardless of the degree of the offense or its seriousness, regardless of his station in life is nevertheless unequivocally entitled to his day in court to establish his innocence and with the opportunity to secure his exoneration.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.753" offset="598392">At the outset, I would like to emphasize that this petitioner's contact with the State of North Carolina is no frivolous skirmish.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.242" offset="636322">This defendant was first indicted in February of 1964 for the grand jury of Orange County upon a bill of indictment charging him with trespass which under North Carolina law is punishable both by a sentence and fine or either one of the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.246" offset="728377">Pursuant to that bill of indictment of February this defendant was brought to trial at the special criminal session in March of 1964 and after a lengthy trial the jury was unable to agree whereupon this defendant was then directed to appear in court on the following Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.021" offset="803506">However, no further proceeding was taken in March with a crowded criminal docket at that time in Orange County for one reason or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.689" offset="854079">The case although it appeared once or twice on the criminal docket there was no further trial proceeding and then in the spring of 1965, counsel for the petitioner inquired of the state as to what the state's position in this case would be in the light of the passage of the 1964 Federal Civil Rights Act and even more in point this Court's decision in Hamm versus City of Rock Hill applying that act retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.609" offset="985840">The Solicitor indicated as the record shows that he intended to take what is known as is nolle prosequi with leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.932" offset="1019068">In April of 1965 when this case was once again on the docket of Orange County Superior Court, this petitioner through his counsel appeared in open court and objected to that procedural point being taken by the State of North Carolina and entered in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.107" offset="1099839">The court animated at that time that it agreed with the state that it might have the nolle prosequi entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.855" offset="1134843">Then the Solicitor having a change of heart decided that he wanted the case back on the trial calendar right at that moment in open court.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.263" offset="1176430">Now, the next session of the Orange County Superior Court then occurred in August of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.160" offset="1204015">Prior to that session of court, it was ascertained that this petitioner's case was not on the trial docket and then an effort to bring the matter to some conclusion, petitioner filed a motion in the Orange County Superior Court wherein he outlined the chronology as to the issuance of the indictment and this prior context with the court, and further urged upon the court that he have an affirmative defense to any further attempt to prosecute this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.829" offset="1346644">In that first of all, this prosecution arose out of a set of circumstances which constitute or which where in the course of a civil rights demonstration wherein the petitioner assault service that I placed which he contended in this motion was a place of public accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.770" offset="1430444">He referred in that motion to the Civil Rights Act, to his contention that Hamm applied -- the Hamm decision applied in his case and in more particular cited the superior court to the case rendered by this Court in 1965 Blow versus North Carolina applying the Civil Rights Act under the Hamm decision retroactively and pointed out in his motion that the facts in his case where as to the operative facts very similar to the Blow decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.833" offset="1578715">At no point in the record or in this record before the Court that the State of North Carolina ever seriously contend or ever contend at all for that matter that the statement in this motion where incorrect.</text>

            <text syncTime="421.387" offset="1788949">What it did request was that the State of North Carolina be directed to proceed in accordance with law and to allow this defendant an opportunity to present those contentions in orderly procedure in the state court, so what we actually asked for a motion was that the judge inquiring to why the State of North Carolina was not willing to give this defendant his day in court in order to urge this point.</text>

            <text syncTime="533.085" offset="2235747">Normally, a trial judge would not consider any case on the docket.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.582" offset="2261661">I mean any case pending before the Court unless the Solicitor has placed it upon the docket.</text>

            <text syncTime="556.083" offset="2327698">In April, the indication by the Solicitor in open court being that he was going to proceed to trial this particular defendant, and all that we were saying at that time was we are ready to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.594" offset="2381720">We did not ask or demand of the court that they had to put this case on for that such.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.664" offset="2406066">What we did was the court under its general supervisory jurisdiction to in effect commit the state to a debt in a certain time when they would give us our day in court.</text>

            <text syncTime="607.390" offset="2532916">Well, if I may I'll briefly explain that procedure in order that the Court can see the context in which we operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.897" offset="2563009">North Carolina allows the Solicitor upon his own initiative as to any case pending in the Court to request the Court that an entry be made either of nolle prosequi which is short in phrase as nol pros in our state or nolle prosequi with leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.806" offset="2638555">Now, the effect of that as the Court has clearly established on our procedure is this, number one, it is not an acquittal if merely relives the defendant from having to attend court from session to session, and secondly releases him from his bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.861" offset="2722774">It in no way is a termination of the action because the Court has explicitly stated that the state may either proceed upon the original bill of indictment at any time or issue a new bill of indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="679.691" offset="2822144">Now with leave means -- well, I'll put it this way, under a nolle prosequi entry in order for the solicitor to reinstitute the proceeding he would have to first apply to the trial judge and get his consent and a trial judge would issue an order directing the clerk of court to issue a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.424" offset="2905109">But then at that point, they could either proceed -- under that procedure they would proceed on the same bill of indictment or if he did not want that instead of going to the court could request an issue, have a presentment sent to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.784" offset="2970520">Now under a nolle prosequi with leave and I might say that under our procedure that is the customary entry rather than just a limited nolle prosequi.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.817" offset="3006673">Under nolle prosequi with leave, the words with leave mean in effect that the court is giving its consent in advance that the Solicitor may reinstitute the proceeding without any further consent from the court he just would merely walk into the clerk's office given the docket number and ask to dictate his issue for that defendant.</text>
