            <label>Mr. John P. Frank</label>
            <text syncTime="29.828" offset="222647">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.616" offset="241873">This matter comes here on a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of Arizona and the issue is the validity of a regulation of the State Land Commissioner of Arizona, Mr. Obed Lassen, my client here which requires that certain lands granted in trust to the State of Arizona by the federal government should be paid for if they are to be taken for the uses which I am going to discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.648" offset="397981">The background of the matter is that we are interpreting an Act of Congress passed in the year 1910.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.565" offset="433612">At that time, there was pending the proposal to admit the 47th and 48th states, New Mexico and Arizona and an Enabling Act was about to be passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.249" offset="492335">The legislation was to contain as in the typical acts for the admission of new states provisions to provide public lands essentially and primarily for schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.676" offset="546043">In this case, it was contemplated that there would be ten and a half million acres of land given to the State of Arizona and a similar amount to the State of New Mexico to be held in trust for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.902" offset="615006">But there had been a background in what was then the territory of New Mexico which disturbed the Congress very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.564" offset="653667">There had been what were known as the Tall Timber cases in which the practice had a reason of despoiling public lands in New Mexico by the devise of purporting to sell lands, having them stripped off their mineral or timber to assets and then giving them back to the state again and so as against this background in this Act, the Congress wished to be particularly careful and so it was and it provided not only as had been the tradition in other acts that the proceeds of public lands should be held in trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.105" offset="815835">The Congress also provided in this joint act for the two states that the very lands themselves should be held in trust and it provided further that those lands could never be disposed of except by the devise of public auction and that they never could they be disposed of except after an appraisal which would determine the true value thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.970" offset="923251">There was a minimum offset price of so and so many dollars in paper but beyond that it was provided that the land should not be sold or leased I quote the statute in a whole or in part except to the highest and best bidder.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.370" offset="988871">And if was further provided in this section and I think is of special importance that all lands, leaseholds, timber and other products should be appraised of their true value and no sale or no other disposal thereof should be made for a consideration less than the value so ascertained.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.510" offset="1073403">Under that statute then the lands were given to the two states and the practical experience has been that they have been frugally handled to the great benefit of education in both of these states.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.192" offset="1128155">In New Mexico, which has a keen interest here because as Your Honor understands, the identical statute in the same provisions and hence we are joined here by Mr. Jordan, Assistant Attorney General from New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.611" offset="1177788">In New Mexico something in the amount of 40% of the educational funds of the state have been developed from these lands and some $200 million has been held in trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.005" offset="1227421">In our own state we have taken a more conservative approach to the use of the lands of the lands and we still have nine and a half million of the ten and a half million acres in the trust and the proceeds of the remainder are held in a permanent school fund and are used for the purposes of developing education in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.898" offset="1318954">These lands as enormous ten million acre track I must make clear is scattered throughout the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.768" offset="1342464">We're not talking about a sector or part of a reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.547" offset="1353540">It's rather a checker boarding of the whole state to establish the public lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.956" offset="1371199">Now --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="317.377" offset="1372871">The ones that are still -- the land share which is still on up held by the state, are they rented?</text>

            <text syncTime="326.110" offset="1407770">For the most part except as they may be subject to grazing or very short term leases are simply held that's part of our vast acreage, Your Honor, is perhaps aware that in our state there were 80% of the total land of the state as public land of one sort or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.680" offset="1466075">This is a relatively small patch of it.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="352.776" offset="1514454">Mr. Frank, does this trust fund differ and essentially from the school lands in other western states?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_p_frank" startTime="361.767" stopTime="713.167">
            <label>Mr. John P. Frank</label>
            <text syncTime="361.767" offset="1550399">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.738" offset="1554369">I have said that these lands were put in trust and I have emphasized that because it dramatizes the extraordinary care Congress took in this case but functionally it's all the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.917" offset="1591045">And that's why eight states have joined us in our position here today and why we are generally supported by all of the states because what has happened in Arizona is a peculiar localism unique to that one area but one which creates a precedent which at this period will prejudice all the public stands of the western states.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.923" offset="1663039">To be precise, as to what has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.103" offset="1675786">A question when lands are to be used for highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.922" offset="1699088">And lands are to be used for highways and for transportation or for some such purpose and I will explain in a moment why I used that broad term.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.904" offset="1730957">They must be paid for and when the lands are taken for example to put in a road or a utility line or something of this sort, do the provisions of the trust law which provided all of the lands without exception shall be paid for in the minimum value do they apply or is there some reason for making an exception and not making a charge for those purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.545" offset="1813504">What has happened in our own state is I think a product of the peculiar road building background there.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.743" offset="1846314">We are in a state which is one has developed relatively recently and in the earlier periods, local and county roads consisted as some of you has seen there a little more than running out of a drag device across the desert than sending a car long after.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.734" offset="1914337">There were decisions in our state and only in our state with an exception I shall mention in the 40s holding that those did not need to be paid for under the Enabling Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.299" offset="1960521">The situation has no radically changed because the roads become gigantic boulevard in interstate highways and we're talking about enormous quantities of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.337" offset="2000750">And in these circumstances, the land commissioner of Arizona who is the trustee, Mr. Lassen, issued a regulation and this regulation provided that lands to be taken for highway purposes should be appraised and could be made available for this purpose but only at their true value after appraisal.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.028" offset="2099493">Now, at that point, the highway department of the state instituted this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.512" offset="2125406">And this action is a suit in the nature under our practice of a written provision brought by the highway department against the land department to prohibit it from enforcing that regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.785" offset="2182562">The matter was presented to our Supreme Court below, and the problem that was presented there is also a problem here that the attorney general is in the sense in both sides because he represents both state agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.732" offset="2234284">This is perfectly appropriate under our practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.789" offset="2246510">It is I'm surely highly undesirable under yours.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.627" offset="2261870">So that what happened there was is a practical matter that the representation of the highway department was placed on the hands of the firm which represents a major utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.227" offset="2316309">A reclamation utility which wishes I am sure to follow along and put its lines in without thing for them to.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.436" offset="2349119">The utility appeared in support of the highway department amicus in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.599" offset="2373778">Meanwhile the teachers of the state have the deepest possible interest in the future of the education and of educational lands and I was retained especially by the teachers for the purpose of filing an amicus brief there and have been denominated a wholly nominal assistant -- special assistant attorney general but in fact representative of the educational interest in the state to bring the matter here.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.864" offset="2478791">Now, I pause with those details to make clear that I think we meet the standard of genuine adversary proceedings and it is adversary indeed but I felt that you should know what the background circumstances of the representation ought.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.484" offset="2541275">The matter as they say came before our state Supreme Court and the state court in a lengthy opinion held that regardless of the trust language the lands need not need to be paid for and thus prohibited the use of the land department's regulation we brought them out of here.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.212" offset="2612224">Now, what is it that is the decision or the essence of the decision of the court below?</text>
            <text syncTime="633.195" offset="2636152">What it comes to is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.630" offset="2657886">Well, it's a lengthy opinion it can boil down to only a couple of sentences and those are set forth and I'll simply mention them because you'll then have in the nutshell exactly what the decision was in the controversy is.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.016" offset="2719431">The court below said that these lands need not be paid for and that the Enabling Act and that these provisions which I have read here need not be observed.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.441" offset="2749106">First, because and I quote "the respective right of way for these highways takes less than a fee estate".</text>
            <text syncTime="672.511" offset="2793409">In other words, they said, this is only taking an easement and when you take an easement you don't have to pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.269" offset="2820472">Second, the court below said the trust and its beneficiaries the school lands are not deprived of anything of value.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.418" offset="2877001">It is well known that good highways throughout the state increase the value of the lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.222" offset="2908244">In other words, the court below reached its results under two grounds, (a) that this is a taking of an easement and that therefore that's free and you don't have to pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.085" offset="2943666">And on the ground (b) that the school --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="713.167" stopTime="715.668">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="713.167" offset="2955995">Is that true that as a general matter under your state law?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_p_frank" startTime="715.668" stopTime="1233.044">
            <label>Mr. John P. Frank</label>
            <text syncTime="715.668" offset="2966026">No, far from it Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.171" offset="2972087">It is not only natural but let me direct myself to that because nobody seriously supports that position of our Supreme Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.909" offset="2999045">The Government has not said a word in behalf of us and neither has the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.091" offset="3015764">Now, in the first place Your Honor, while it may be true or not that taking an easement is that the taking of roads for our purposes is a matter of taking an easement.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.686" offset="3066128">This is immaterial and frankly non-rational for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.295" offset="3080547">First, clearly from every practical standpoint only in interstate highway across the land of the State of Arizona with tons of concrete on the ground is in every functional sense identical to taking a fee that makes any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.819" offset="3134673">But secondly and the reason why this becomes immaterial and I shall not mention it again and I am sure you'll hear no more of it from the other side, is that the statute clearly is the -- I am speaking of the Enabling Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.722" offset="3190262">The Enabling Act isn't restricted to the taking of fee interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.948" offset="3207189">The Enabling Act says that there must be payment in full at the appraised value for the -- for any, it uses that broad term for any disposition of the lands and on top of that it nails it down Your Honor by saying that there must be taking in full for the use of the lands so that regarding the easement as regarding this as an easement if it is and it clearly from the functional standpoint would be almost absurd the use of property concepts but regarding at as such it doesn't make any difference because the statute says that whether you take this position any disposition what you take the use of is immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.769" offset="3378448">So the matter comes to the remaining elements of the case and that remaining element of the case what the court below has said here in essence that it had -- I mean to judge you by it but it is similar to the -- what's good for General Motors is good for the country approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.480" offset="3461308">What the court below is saying is roads are good for the state, what's good for the state is good for the school lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.062" offset="3495581">This will increase the value of the school lands; therefore you don't need to pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.950" offset="3515120">What's for the general good is sufficient and there need not be dollars in hand paid, that's the essence of the decision below and it's the essence of what has been the peculiar Arizona position on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.054" offset="3567574">Now, in the first place Your Honor, allow to devote myself to that subject for the balance of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.772" offset="3598503">We begin number one with the language of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.784" offset="3626506">We begin with the fact that the statute expressly in the clearest possible way says that lands are to be paid for.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.777" offset="3666526">It does not permit of the so-called doctrine of enhancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.753" offset="3690350">It doesn't say that the land shall be valued and that there should be credited against the value whatever plus that there may be thought become as a result of the taking but nothing like that is in this law at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.719" offset="3746252">Instead it does in the most expressed possible way put certain statutory minimum and then in the most exact possible way says that there should be an appraisal and there should be no sale of any lands or disposition of any lands, any taking for any use of any land except of that level of value.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.049" offset="3819604">Now, I have begun by saying that this was a statute which have had very close congressional attention particularly because of the background of land scandals against which it was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.274" offset="3868505">And this is so Your Honors, they -- we have set forth a good deal of the legislative histories in our briefs and I won't give you more than the flavor of it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.517" offset="3909465">But I wish to note that these particular restrictions were added in their final forum by the Senate Committee after full hearings and that the report show great emphasis on what the statute says so that the Senate Report says that these lands shall be held in trust to be disposed of only as therein provided and the question was expressly considered before one of the congressional committees are these restrictions too heavy?</text>
            <text syncTime="982.506" offset="4033390">Are they severe, can you live with these?</text>
            <text syncTime="984.402" offset="4041017">It is alright?</text>
            <text syncTime="985.862" offset="4046869">And the representative of Arizona appearing before the committee, appearing in behalf of the territory in asking for statehood said that when asked about these careful restrictions based on the lands and I am quoting from the question he said I believe the restrictions on such public lands cannot be made too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.051" offset="4135581">In other words, the territory in asking for statehood was welcoming the very kind of provisions which in fact were put into this law and the report of the interior department shows that in -- as a result of the very investigation that have been made of land frauds, these provisions saying you can only take it this way, you can only price it this way had been put in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.608" offset="4249788">The final report of the Senate Committee began and I give you this as indication of the tremendous earnestness of which the committee approach the problem began your committee cannot too earnestly call attention to the extreme care that should be taken with every provision of a bill like this and I go on to tell that but they were particularly meticulous in a matter of this kind and this matter of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.554" offset="4377579">Now, what has happened since?</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.941" offset="4387088">We have had not merely a legislative history of great care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.434" offset="4405060">We have had a subsequent congressional development of great care in dealing with this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.276" offset="4428466">Because this Act is of course subject to amendment and the point is that whenever it has been proposed that there be any deviation from these careful pricing terms or from the careful disposition terms the interested parties have gone back to Congress and presented the matter and they have gotten an amendment if Congress wanted to give it and because this trust was accepted by the State of Arizona and is part of our Constitution, this may require an amendment to our state constitution as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.277" offset="4564511">But to give one illustration just a single illustration which will dramatize it I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.928" offset="4583111">We have a little village in our state called the town of Benson and the town of Benson is so small that it was unable when it wanted a section of land just that small amount for a public park to pay the $3.50 an acre amount which would be needed even for that 600 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.759" offset="4666389">They simply couldn't afford it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.928" offset="4671091">We are talking about a very small town.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.550" offset="4685615">And therefore, an amendment was passed through the Congress which expressly authorized the giving of a section of land, a single section to the town of Benson without compensation and the legislative history expressly shows that this was done because there was no way of dedicating that one section for a public use except by paying for it other than by this amendment of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.271" offset="4816436">Now, Your Honors, I have no doubt and I am sure no one did then when the sincere truly sincere people who passed that act passed it but they felt that the giving of this section to Benson would improve the value of the town of Benson and improve values of the land around it and doubtlessly the giving of that section would do something for the general values of all of the rest of the school line of the region or the state or whatever but the point is that it was not supposed that the piddling amount of $2000.00 worth of land could be disposed of without compensation except by an Act of Congress and yet under the Arizona decision and practice from which we appeal, $9 million worth of land have been taken from this school trust funds already and are irretrievably gone --</text>

            <text syncTime="1365.767" offset="5566464">Have I met your point at the best of my ability Mr. Justice Fortas?</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.916" offset="5583078">The argument which is made here then by the other side is that enhancement of value is to be presumed and that this is to be presumed to be an offset so that you don't have to pay for the lands when you take them, whether you take them for highway purposes or for utility or other purposes for which they might be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.465" offset="5677223">Now, there is this difference of position amongst our adversaries and I identified only so that I may sharply and fairly state our own position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.372" offset="5712854">The position of our adversaries divides in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.348" offset="5728737">The highway department as you will shortly hear from takes the position as the court below did that one must always presume that there is enough value created by a road so you never have to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.359" offset="5780773">You should be thankful that a piece of your land is taken under the road is put upon.</text>

            <text syncTime="1428.945" offset="5819120">The land division takes the position that we are right in principle and that the Supreme Court of Arizona should be reversed but that in some instances, it will turn out as a matter of fact that there is an enhancement of value as a result of the road and that therefore there need be no compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.962" offset="5907205">Our position on that point and our position on the total matter is this, we say when Congress established this trust it could have provided for an enhancement theory of valuation if it wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.648" offset="5973974">It could have been put in to the statute a provision that there shall be credited back any value which is assumed to exist as a result of the disposition of the land.</text>

            <text syncTime="1566.627" offset="6369886">That the statute provides for a system of valuation, this regulation provides for a system of valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.671" offset="6398098">This regulation which we are asking be upheld says that no lands may be disposed of except that they appraise value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.426" offset="6421086">It's taken from verbatim from the statute and if therefore the Supreme Court of Arizona is reversed and the regulation is thereby upheld so that be the result then I would think that the Government position could fall with it so that I am compelled to say that that question is so interlock here that I don't believe it could be separated out perhaps by ingenious drafting one might come up with an opinion that did not reach that matter and of course that's all is possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.705" offset="6534144">But I believe in all candor it's here, Mr. Lassen's regulation says that there shall be an appraisal and no disposition of the lands except that the appraised value in every and does not provide for a credit in case of some incremental value as this assumes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1654.222" offset="6720240">This question crops up in substantially all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.871" offset="6734869">There is one case and one only in the country which is against our present position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.218" offset="6760260">There was an early Wyoming case, the decision of Ross which takes essentially the view of the Arizona Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.852" offset="6790771">What you have before you a brief from the attorney general of which the attorney general of Wyoming has joined showing that that is not in fact followed in that jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.399" offset="6832985">And the whole weight of the state cases has been as I am arguing here a leading example is the case of Walker which comes from the State of New Mexico and there was thus a flat conflict just directly on this very statute, New Mexico and Walker having decided this question the opposite way of way in which Arizona has decided but apart from those state cases which are adequately discussed in the brief, apart from those cases, there is the decision of this Court in Ervien which is a matter which arose from New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.196" offset="6980106">What happened there was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.807" offset="6986585">The State of New Mexico with a foreshadowing of this exact point of view had said, A good advertising program for our state is just what we need and it will increase the value of all of the lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.719" offset="7050219">Everybody will be better off as a result and therefore trust funds may be used for this general promotional purpose and we will assume that there will be a sufficient value caused by those -- that advertising program, so that the lands will gain more than they lose by this disposition of the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.501" offset="7137364">Now, that matter was put into issue and in coming into issue it came here following an extensive consideration of the matter in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals and in the Eighth Circuit the almost precise point was considered that is the exact highway question just what we're talking about, what the Eighth Circuit said is it would be but a step further to argue the advantage that would approve to the trust from the physical construction of and so on and then it says specifically such as systems of public highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.748" offset="7342373">In other words, in Ervien the Eighth Circuit expressly held out the use of the funds for public highway purposes as precisely the kind of thing which was not to be allowed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1825.813" offset="7406634">You had a short opinion of your own but the Eighth Circuit opinion is expressly incorporated by reference here and this Court said and I'd like to emphasize these words to preclude any license of construction or liberties of inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.512" offset="7473403">It was declared that the disposition of any of the land for any purpose other than that provided therein would be deemed to breach of trust and this Court said the dedication we repeat was "special and exact".</text>

            <text syncTime="1902.332" offset="7712684">The argument that has been made for the other side is essentially that an Enabling Act simply doesn't have to obeyed that strictly but the states are entitled to take a latitudinarian view of their enabling acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.187" offset="7764093">The argument is made essentially and it is based almost entirely on the case of Coyle against Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.993" offset="7791365">Now, that was the case involving the Oklahoma Enabling Act and it was the one under which it was held that as an equal footing matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2036.351" offset="8248822">The answer at least in the cases is this, under virtually vertical language in 1903 Idaho decision which we've discussed fully says yes, that they can be, that they are subject to eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.777" offset="8310471">In 1910, Montana decision is the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.221" offset="8328234">It rejected the Idaho decision and said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.003" offset="8347355">Our act was passed just before the Montana decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.237" offset="8368358">In 1921, Congress passed the statute dealing with the argument raised by the Montana decision and in that Act which dealt only with the states under that particular Enabling Act, it didn't amend the law generally, Congress declined to take a position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.637" offset="8437948">It said we don't have to decide its language was a strict and perhaps accurate interpretation of the acts with bar eminent domain therefore, in order to remedy this situation, we expressly allow it and in that Act they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.897" offset="8510986">Now, how does that bear in that situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.656" offset="8521958">What our land commissioner has done is to provide that all land must go by appraisal but on the other hand under this regulation he does not require that it be sold at public auction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.602" offset="8569814">The statute says it must be sold at public auction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.174" offset="8588100">This regulation does not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.668" offset="8598026">It does not because the appraisal procedure is part of our state eminent domain procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.149" offset="8623940">And he has consciously imported the imminent domain devise following the Idaho decision and sought to use it on the theory that the eminent domain procedures can be applied and therefore he takes the appraisal device from our eminent domain law but does not require the option.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.969" offset="8699277">If this is permitted Mr. Justice White it is implied exception under the theory of West River Bridge and Dix that all acts are subject to the eminent domain power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.852" offset="8734804">I would like to make clear that we think this is the sound review when we've advanced it in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.371" offset="8756851">We think this is acceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.461" offset="8765210">I also wish to make clear that this is not of the essence of our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.132" offset="8783914">In other words, we could perfectly well go through to the form of appearing to auction off a 50-mile strip of a thousand feet wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.671" offset="8818082">Obviously, there's only going to be one bidder and it would be a pure ceremony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.019" offset="8835427">But that can be done and while it's not in the regulation, we haven't the faintest objection of putting it there if this Court feels that we can impart eminent domain theory into this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.528" offset="8877432">So, so far as we are concerned, it's essentially a matter of indifference but I do report that the problem does exist, Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.306" offset="8904600">It is here and we have in our actual conduct attempted to apply that procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.378" offset="8932916">Now, I may simply say this in conclusion and I hope I am saving a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.347" offset="8956740">The Congress has given 10 million acres to the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.056" offset="8975548">It did pass an act with what the congressional committee report shows was extreme care with painstaking care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.489" offset="9013373">This Court has said that it was a painstakingly careful act about your own language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.940" offset="9043153">Now, let me simply put this question to my friends who are next to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.568" offset="9061648">If you have the task of drafting a statute, if you were a member of Congress, if you wanted to draft an Act which would provide that all lands that were taken had to be paid for in appraised value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.917" offset="9115042">How would you possibly do it any more precisely than to say that all lands, leaseholds, timbers and other products before bringing offer for any sale or other disposal shall be appraised as a true value and no sale shall be made for less than that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.670" offset="9182020">I submit Your Honors that it is beyond the capacity of the English language to be more exact, more precise, more specific than this and I leave my adversaries with a question suppose the Congress of the United States didn't want to do exactly what we're saying it did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.193" offset="9252133">How could it conceivably have done a better job than it has been done in this case in this very case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.626" offset="9281912">Our state stands alone in this country and taking the view, the trust lands can be taken and not be paid for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.077" offset="9315662">Nine million dollars worth of land are here irretrievably gone unless we can treat them as void and somehow recover for that loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.374" offset="9352861">We respectfully submit in behalf of the educational institutions of our state that this is an invasion of a public trust which must stop.</text>

            <text syncTime="2324.743" offset="9402389">Mr. Chief Justice, Justices of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.374" offset="9416913">The position of the United States in this case as an amicus curiae arises because of the federal government's interest in these trust lands as grantor of the trust lands because of the duty imposed upon the attorney general by Section 28 of the Arizona, New Mexico's enabling acts and because of course of the federal government's growing interest in the field of education and its financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.970" offset="9523284">Before I embark upon the details of its position, I would like to address myself to a question as of the counsel for the state land department by Mr. Justice Fortas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.898" offset="9570931">That is, what is the real question before this Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.336" offset="9584724">Is it simply in the absolute sense, must compensation be paid by the state when it takes school lands for public purposes?</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.005" offset="9623385">If that were the naked question before this Court, I think all parties would say that perhaps it has already been answered by agreement for even the state highway department now refers in its brief that value must be paid for these school trust lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.213" offset="9692244">However, they say that the value is paid by the inherent enhancement that arises when a highway is built.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.343" offset="9728711">Of course, in a real sense that position is that value need not be paid because if you can conclusively and irrebuttably presume compensation as the highway enhancement rather as the highway department urges you will foreclose any inquiry as to what really happens to the value of the trust when the lands are taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.066" offset="9831633">United States decision in this case is that you must look at the trust lands as a whole in a given state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.224" offset="9868309">They are there to produce income to support and maintain the public schools of that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.526" offset="9893491">The question is when a trust land is taken for a public purpose such as a highway, is the earning power of that trust impaired?</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.520" offset="9933406">Is it no longer as valuable after the taking as it was before?</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.391" offset="9956916">If that is so, and the trust is breached and what the state has done is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.895" offset="9986905">Can you consider the question of enhancement of other lands when you take a parcel, a school section to build a highway and I think you can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.753" offset="10022431">Let us say for example that the entire value of the lands -- school lands in the state is $10 million and you take one section you build one road on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.977" offset="10067257">Clearly, that section no longer has a value in itself because the road is so large that no one would lease it, no income can be earned from that school section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.951" offset="10107173">But if this highway, his access to a whole new portion of the state so that the lands there can now leased at high rental, can be sold for high prices then of course it is fair to state that the trust is preserved even though compensation is not paid by the state for the particular parcel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.608" offset="10193795">On the other hand, it is equally reasonable to state that in certain cases, a taking for a highway will result in no enhancement of the remainder of the trust and the total value the trust enhance its earning power will be diminished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.265" offset="10256384">A simple example, an access road is needed to make it easier to get to the state prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.157" offset="10283969">I could not see that this would increase the pecuniary value of other school lands within a state so that you can say enhancement can be presumed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2999.003" offset="12099375">As to the contentions made by petitioner that the recognitions of these benefits are foreclosed by the enabling act, I think what Congress was speaking of was in terms of actual disposition to private parties which is a quite different matter than changes of ownerships through eminent domain proceeding the latter having inherent safeguards of judicial review of an initial determination at least in Arizona by an administrative agency whereas a provision relating to an absolute outright sale by a state through a private party is an area where review is not inherent and not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.994" offset="12291323">In fact the very thing complained of in the Tall Timber cases, eminent domain where both parties are presumably interested in the public good and the public benefit is quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.304" offset="12340537">I think the enabling act permits the interpretation that we quite submit of that is benefits to the remaining land can be recognized and compensation in some cases need not be paid in form of cash because it has actually resulted in terms of enhanced value to the remainder.</text>

            <text syncTime="3967.556" offset="15973648">The first one is whether net value enhancement is relevant at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3991.172" offset="16068106">On this issue, the United States and the respondent are in agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.783" offset="16090467">The second issue is that assuming that net value enhancement is that the net value enhancement is a permissible consideration for the state taking the consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.151" offset="16124008">How do you go about showing whether in fact the net benefit of the mere fact of highway construction across the trust lands has been to benefit or to derogate from the value of these lands is on this issue that the respondents and the United States are in disagreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="4107.220" offset="16532250">The rule in Arizona happens to be different and I would like to clarify this, the rule in Arizona, A.R.S.Section 12-1122 is that you can't offset benefit to remaining trust lands only against the severance damages that is the amount that you damage those remaining trust lands and not against the value.</text>

            <text syncTime="4138.046" offset="16655548">I'll develop this more completely in the course of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4140.819" offset="16666624">But we contend that the State of Arizona could have had it solely elected adopted this principle of eminent domain but what we are dealing here with is three essential provisions in our view, provisions that appear in Section 28 of the Enabling Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.430" offset="16733080">Mr. Frank has referred to two of these and I will advert to them in a moment briefly for that reason but first is the public auction provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.153" offset="16759933">Mr. Frank has stated there is a blanket provision that permits of no exception which states that these lands must be disposed of by public auction which you have to give notice of that public auction for ten weeks once each week for a period of 10 weeks in two different newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.995" offset="16827329">The second provision that is relevant and this of course Mr. Justice Fortas is particularly going to bear down that all of the interest shall be appraised and that no sale or other disposal thereof shall be made for a consideration less than the value so ascertained and finally the provision that has not been yet mentioned this day but a provision which is of extreme importance is the catch all provision that comes at the end of Section 28 the one dealing with these trust land provisions and says this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.268" offset="16960449">I am reading from the appendix, the petitioner's brief at the bottom of page 39, "Every sale, lease, conveyance or contract of or concerning any of the lands hereby granted or confirmed or the use thereof or the national products thereof not made in substantial conformity with the provisions of this Act shall be null and void."</text>
            <text syncTime="4235.226" offset="17044250">And I'd like to consider first as a background to the value provision because I think it sheds light on it the applicability of these public auction provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.590" offset="17081762">The great significance of this pubic auction provision is that they don't apply to use this for highway purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4253.919" offset="17119065">Every governmental agency that had addressed itself to this problem has agreed on this point that you don't have to submit highways which are -- lands which are going to be used for highway purposes to these public auction provisions notice for over a period of 10 weeks and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4269.455" offset="17181236">From a practical standpoint, the reason is obvious, we're dealing here with strips of land that are 100 feet wide, a mile long, and bounded on each end by a proposed highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="4279.971" offset="17223241">As a matter of fact, they know that it is going to be interested in bidding on those -- on the strips, on the long narrow strips of land except the highway department and --</text>

            <text syncTime="4330.300" offset="17424593">As Mr. Frank has pointed out this morning, the dominant consideration underlying Congress' enactment of this Enabling Act was to prevent the sale of these lands to private proprietors.</text>

            <text syncTime="4370.774" offset="17586448">I first of all say its obvious inappropriateness to the highway context is saved by the interaction of two facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="4385.978" offset="17647261">And number two, the fact that Congress did not deal with this specific face of the problem it did deal with it as a generic type by this substantial conformity clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="4497.295" offset="18092596">Well, I think it's also implicit in this paragraph which says that these shall not be disposed of except for value though the language has not expressly written in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4506.437" offset="18129168">This -- Congress set forth certain general restrictions and certain general principles, manifestly Congress could not in 1910 foresee all of the problems that are going to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="4521.670" offset="18190085">A case in point did not foresee that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4524.683" offset="18202102">Now I will get into that in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.362" offset="18212864">But Congress did provide, Congress did recognize that it couldn't foresee all the problems and therefore it provided that substantial conformity was to be the applicable rule within the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="4538.594" offset="18257795">Therefore, the obligation which is imposed upon the state is and I think it is at this point the reasoning of the government's brief is particularly helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="4549.439" offset="18301158">The government points out in its brief that there is no precise blueprint detailing the exact nature of the responsibilities of the state that under these circumstances, the obligation of the state is determined by the general principle of the general purposes of the Act and that so long as the overall value of the trust is maintained that the state is entitled to use these lands for public purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4574.428" offset="18401050">So long as it's in substantial conformity for the purpose of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4578.976" offset="18419231">Now, is it we submit that it is for various reasons that have discussed in our brief I'd like to mention just very briefly two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4590.053" offset="18463535">One is that this is not a noble decision and the only one of its kind in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4595.577" offset="18485687">Mr. Frank recognized the opinion of the Wyoming Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4600.314" offset="18504600">Though not dealing with enabling acts there are other states for example New Jersey which in the Constitution has certain restrictions placed on certain kinds of lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="4609.481" offset="18541275">We have cited about five or six cases in our briefs dealing with those type of constitutional provisions which dignity wise are of a simple -- similar type of dignity of this Enabling Act and various different states have held that in these lands may be used for highway construction purposes if the offsetting value increment to remaining trust land is at least equal to the value of the lands taken for these purposes but the point on which I would like to bear down particularly is the point that Arizona is entitled to interpret value as meaning value to each of the trust lands and not just value to the lands taken for the reason that is the position has been taken by the United States Attorney General over a period of 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4665.186" offset="18764152">This interpretation is significant not only because of its intrinsic persuasiveness but also by virtue of the bare fact that it is the position that has been taken by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="4678.631" offset="18817860">The enforcement response -- well, the act does leave it, it is true to either the states or any individual the right to enforce the provision of this act but the primary responsibility, the first line of defense is the United States Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="4698.636" offset="18897899">There's of course a familiar doctrine that interpretation placed upon the federal statute by the agency charged with the enforcement of that statute are entitled to particular weight as Mr. Chief Justice Warren pointed out for the Court in Udall versus Tallman, it need not necessarily be the only interpretation which the act might permit nor need it be the interpretation which we as an original manner might have adopted had the case originally had arisen as a judicial case or in the context of a judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4733.271" offset="19036453">And the particularly significant thing about the interpretation of the justice department in this case is that it extends over a period of more than 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4744.240" offset="19080338">As the opinion of the lower court pointed out the practice that is presently under attack is of some 50 years standing in this State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="4753.509" offset="19117432">During all of that 50-year period, United States Attorney General has never taken any action to have this practice declared invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4764.273" offset="19160482">This acquiescence we submit has not been through inadvertence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.808" offset="19178559">In those instances in which practices have occurred which have truly derogated from the value of the trust the United States Attorney General had been swept for act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4776.278" offset="19208443">For example, in this Tall Timber cases which have been so prominently referred to involved were 12 suits which were brought in the territorial court for the New Mexico by the attorney general's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="4792.058" offset="19271555">Similarly in 1915 when the State of New Mexico enacted an act, a statute providing that 3% of the proceeds from the sale of all these lands should be used to advertise the advantages and resources of the State of New Mexico generally, the attorney general's office was successful in having the statute declared invalid as repugnant to the enabling act and this was the Irving litigation which eventually terminated in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4822.499" offset="19393390">The action of the attorney general in the Irving case was swept and decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4828.536" offset="19417527">The New Mexico Act was passed on March 8, 1915 and the federal district court action was instituted by the attorney general less than five months later on August 7, 1915 yet during all the time that this Ervien litigation was progressing, the very practice which is under attack here was in effect under the State of Arizona and the united states attorney general's office made no look to take any corrective action.</text>

            <text syncTime="4859.808" offset="19542601">But we have there in two states side by side that are identical enabling act provisions practiced by one was attacked, a practice by one was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4870.663" offset="19586069">This of course brings us to the question of whether there are determinative differences between the two practices and we submit that there are for two reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.323" offset="19616684">The first is that that which the United States suggested indicated earlier that the basic concept of these value provisions of the trust is that a certain package of trust land has conveyed to the state with a thought in mind that one day it will be converted into cash and these cash will be used for the purpose of schools, hospitals, reformatories and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.678" offset="19718040">Once the funds, once these lands are converted into cash, they remain invaluable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.949" offset="19739146">You can't use them for any other purpose and that's the first difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4913.288" offset="19756492">If the State of New Mexico directly used the funds resulting from the sale of the lands themselves, that is not the problem in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4923.639" offset="19797974">The problem in this case is rather whether or how the lands which one day will be disposed of and converted into cash are to be maintained or to have their integral value maintained so that at that time that they are disposed of the value will not be lesser because the use that has been made of the interim period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4947.217" offset="19892224">The second difference is this, Mr. Frank had referred to the fact of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals was cited with approval by Mr. Justice McKinney's majority opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4957.392" offset="19932975">If you read the opinion of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals you see, that the real problem that the Court there was concerned with was the fact that these trust lands comprised only 126 of the total area of the state and yet there has been 126 of the lands were being made to bear the brunt of an advertising program which presumably would benefit the entire state, the opinion --</text>

            <text syncTime="6079.083" offset="24419662">For example, the establishment of schools, the establishment of hospitals, and the establishment of reformatories lies within the exclusive responsibility of the state itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="6101.202" offset="24508165">Once the state is determined and you can set the standards, the state can set the standard for school just as high or low, or just it wants to.</text>

            <text syncTime="6247.409" offset="25092995">In the case of the Dallas study, the increase of value of the surrounding lands was even in excess of the cost of construction of the highway itself and we don't whether the members of the Arizona Supreme Court took these particular factors into consideration or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="6477.291" offset="26012505">If that were happening, the doctrine of enhancement would not apply so that under the position taken by the highway department under our law these lands are put, the school lands are put in a position inferior to the railroad lands or to any other lands because under our expressed statutes and categorical decisions there would be no such enhancement as they are claiming here.</text>

            <text syncTime="6814.766" offset="27362408">I will advert in closing only to one last matter and that is the argument which has been made by Mr. Lee that non-enforcement by the attorney general in past years is a reason why the Act evaporates now and can't be enforced anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="6835.094" offset="27443702">We submit, Your Honor that the Act is not so fragile that it is erased by the fact that the attorney general may not have brought an action earlier from this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6843.821" offset="27478706">It is true that there are changing circumstances and the problem does become larger and more frightening as we see the roads taking the land and the utility standing behind it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6852.394" offset="27512978">As it happens, the Arizona Education Association representing the teachers who are concerned not for now because this doesn't effect now but for the future of the state have seen fit to press this matter and to bring it here to protect those school lands and we respectfully submit that this has been a public service on their part and that they are not part in pressing that argument through us here and before this Court to protect these trust lands whatever the course of ignoring these values may have been on the past.</text>
