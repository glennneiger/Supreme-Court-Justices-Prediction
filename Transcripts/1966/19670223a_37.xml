            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="107520">Number 150, the Associated Press, Petitioner, versus Edwin A. Walker.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.104" offset="335935">Mr. Rogers?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_p_rogers" startTime="67.073" stopTime="207.832">
            <label>Mr. William P. Rogers</label>
            <text syncTime="67.073" offset="375745">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.659" offset="394136">This is a libel action in which General Edwin Walker has recovered a judgment of $500,000 against the Associated Press for general damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.005" offset="439484">There was no claim made nor there was any evidence offered that he suffered any actual damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.324" offset="460800">In addition to the $500,000 general damage as reward, the jury awarded $300,000 in punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.528" offset="493610">The trial court set aside this award on the ground that there was no malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.298" offset="520673">The suit is based on news reports concerning Walker's activities in Oxford, Mississippi during the night of September 30, 1962, a night when violence and bloodshed climaxed in attempt by James Meredith, a Negro to enroll as a student at the University of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.658" offset="606145">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit had ordered the admission of Mr. Meredith to the then all-white university.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.655" offset="638119">But some of the highest elected officials in the State had asked that they would defy the order of the federal court and prevent Mr. Meredith's admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.637" offset="678034">The Associated Press reported the events which followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.185" offset="696216">The statements complained of in this case were contained in two news dispatches dated October 2nd and 3rd which originated with a local Associated Press reporter, who was on the campus at the time of the rioting and witnessed the events which he reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.417" offset="773120">Those statements were: One, that General Walker assumed command of the crowd; and two, that he led a charge of students against the federal marshals who were there to see that the order of the Circuit Court was carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.875" offset="831007">A basic constitutional issue raised by this appeal before the document of New York Times against Sullivan is to be confined solely to public officials or whether it should be extended to persons like General Walker, who though not technically public officials, are public figures or persons of political prominence who have thrust themselves in the vortex of a question of pressing public concern.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_p_rogers" startTime="215.916" stopTime="284.612">
            <label>Mr. William P. Rogers</label>
            <text syncTime="215.916" offset="971128">The issue is presented squarely on this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.214" offset="984294">The issue before the New York Times to be extended because all three Texas courts, the trial court and the appellate courts quite properly found that the statements were published without any malice as defined in the New York Times case.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.067" offset="1043749">Under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution, the Associated Press also claims that the news reports were substantially true and therefore the judgment represents an unconstitutional denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.626" offset="1094008">That an award of $500,000 in general damages is unconstitutionally oppressive and that the defense of “fair comment” as applied in this case has been unconstitutionally limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.664" offset="1150119">This case, I believe, represents one of the most serious attacks ever made on the press in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.034" offset="1183556">It is but one of the 50 libel cases brought by General Walker against the Associated Press, its members or both, arising out of news reports identical or almost identical with the one involved in this litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="290.274" offset="1268611">I suppose counsel will.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.959" offset="1279269">The General has made claims -- I'll come to the conflict of testimony in just a moment, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.767" offset="1298495">The General has made claims against a significant portion of the press asking for damages totaling more than $33 million.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="307.683" offset="1338201">Has he won all of those suits?</text>

            <label>Mr. William P. Rogers</label>

            <text syncTime="311.417" offset="1353143">Now, the technique that he uses is very simple and effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.702" offset="1366309">He is attempting to convert the libel laws of this country and the weapons of intimidation, harassment, and punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.854" offset="1394834">And it is only fair to say that up to now he's been very successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.059" offset="1411657">What gave rise to the Associated Press' dispatch a theory?</text>
            <text syncTime="330.330" offset="1428793">This Court will recall the many months of legal proceedings involving the admission of James Meredith to the University of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.703" offset="1462230">When he had finally arrived at the university to register on September 30th, as called for by the order of the Court, this Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.267" offset="1504549">He was accompanied by federal marshals, who were there to see that the order was complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.844" offset="1526805">That evening, when the word got around that Meredith was in the campus, there occurred what General Walker has seemed fit to label a protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.708" offset="1566302">It consisted of a series of violent attacks on the marshals, federal marshals with rocks, sticks, bricks, bulldozers, fire engines, and Molotov cocktails.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.509" offset="1609456">One deputy marshal had a leg broken.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.072" offset="1619801">One was hit in the head.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.363" offset="1628891">One deputy marshal was shot in the back.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.712" offset="1642266">The rioting left two persons dead and more than 50 injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.449" offset="1661283">It was a protest which brought the United States into this refute all over the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.590" offset="1681868">It was under this scene that General Walker appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.346" offset="1696810">It was into this vortex that he thrusts himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.298" offset="1716663">The General did not come to the scene unheralded.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.116" offset="1731918">He made sure of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.486" offset="1741427">Over a period of several days with a maximum of fanfare, he announced his plans in a series of telecasts, radio broadcasts, and press conferences as he made his way to Oxford.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.713" offset="1794299">For example at Shreveport, Louisiana on September 26th in a radio broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.106" offset="1811853">Here's what he said, “Rise to a stand beside Governor Ross Barnett of Jackson, Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.771" offset="1838602">Now is the time to be heard, 10,000 strong from every state in the union, rally to the cause of freedom, the battle cry of the Republic.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.360" offset="1872875">Barnett, Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.402" offset="1877055">Castro, No.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.144" offset="1884056">Bring your flag, your tents and your skillets.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.193" offset="1892206">It is the time, now or never.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.614" offset="1901923">The time is when and if the President of the United States commits or uses any troops federal or state in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.857" offset="1926896">The last time in such a situation, in 1957 and 1958 at Little Rock, I was on the wrong side.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.663" offset="1958139">This time I will be on the right side.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.860" offset="1970887">I will be there”.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.665" offset="1978096">On another day, a day or two, another occasion a day or two before the riots, when he was asked if he recommended that the volunteers go armed, General Walker said, and I quote, “The administration has indicated it will do whatever is necessary to enforce its unconstitutional action.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.137" offset="2048000">I have stated that whatever is necessary to oppose that enforcement and stand behind Governor Barnett, should be done”.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.588" offset="2081855">On the eve of the riots, Walker held a press conference at Oxford and announced that Governor Barnett, who by this time has been held in contempt by the Fifth Circuit, was being supported by thousands of people beyond the borders of Mississippi, now on their way to join him at Oxford.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.234" offset="2160431">On September 30th, when President Kennedy, in a national television broadcast, appealed for preservation of law and order, General Walker publicly said, “Nauseating, nauseating”.</text>

            <text syncTime="546.442" offset="2293238">The evidence is clear and admitted that Walker thrust himself into the middle of this highly charged public controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.513" offset="2329496">Not only did he, in the words of this Court in Rosenblatt, thrust himself into the vortex of the controversy, but he played a major role in creating the controversy and in giving leadership to those who sought to obstruct the order of the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.288" offset="2388637">Now, the General has denies it.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.598" offset="2397832">He would have this Court believe, notwithstanding all the broadcast, press conferences, which are a matter of record that he went to the campus as an observer or as a spectator.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.872" offset="2446942">Or as he said in his testimony, “Just to see for myself exactly what happened”.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.392" offset="2468989">Of course, this is an outrageous and offensive lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.273" offset="2480588">It is perfectly obvious, based on his own words that he did not go to the scene as a spectator, or an observer?</text>
            <text syncTime="599.382" offset="2505038">He went there as a participant as an active collaborator.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.587" offset="2525832">Walker went to the campus at Oxford for the stated purpose, in his own words, of preventing the order of the federal court from being carried out, as he said, “to be on the right side, this time”.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.045" offset="2571598">He was willing and anxious to do what he could to help that cause of in a position as he clearly demonstrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.571" offset="2601796">In fact on the record -- in the record, he admits that he asked the sheriff to be deputized so he could help the Mississippi authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.113" offset="2635964">What were his activities when he arrived to the campus at Oxford?</text>
            <text syncTime="636.990" offset="2655399">Well, he admits, he went to scene of the rioting at about 8:30, and remained there on the campus until about 2 a.m.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.567" offset="2689776">He was hailed as the leader of the riots -- rioters.</text>

            <text syncTime="1019.858" offset="4186906">Your Honor as I was just concluding the point that there's no doubt about it that when General Walker got to the campus that night he was the central figure among the rioters because of what he has said before he arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.535" offset="4249600">Now, what was the basis for the charge for the Associated Press report that he led the charge of students against the marshals?</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.262" offset="4296516">Well, the trial court said, leading the charge means encouraging persons and the charge means movement towards the marshals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.098" offset="4339879">The evidence showed that on at least two occasions the general encouraged the crowd and moved towards the marshals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.631" offset="4366002">The marshals were in front of the administration building, surrounding the administration building, protecting that building because the crowd at that time I think thought Mr. Meredith was in the building.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.214" offset="4412291">The rioters were on that what is called “the circle”, an area of about the size of two football fields next to the administration building, there's a flagpole in the middle, and in the other end on the east side it's the confederate monument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.614" offset="4465894">Now, at the confederate monument the General made his speech and on several -- and at least two occasions he moved in the direction of the administration building with people following him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.956" offset="4507272">I would like to just quote a couple of comments, one from Mr. John King, who was the manager of the local radio station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.862" offset="4534962">Who heard Walker say to the crowd, “You're doing fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.576" offset="4549799">Riot!</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.208" offset="4552307">You're getting news all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.375" offset="4560980">Now you've got casualties”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.594" offset="4569861">A clear description of what happened that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.038" offset="4583654">I think it's important because this is the description given by one of Walker's own witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.689" offset="4606224">A man named Mr. Whit, who was a deputy sheriff and who was on the campus at the time, and who was with Walker during the whole evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.579" offset="4641750">And that two -- about two months after the events, he gave a statement to the lawyers of Associated Press, and in the statement he said these things and it was a signed statement by the deputy sheriff, “After some of the crowd, I'd asked Walker if he would lead them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.677" offset="4714162">He stepped out and sat at the monument and said, keep protesting and see if we could get closer”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.681" offset="4734224">And he then started toward the marshals and the crowd at least a thousand by this time followed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.667" offset="4754181">This crowd was armed with sticks, rocks, Coca-Cola bottles and other things as I heretofore stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.966" offset="4779363">They seem to have anything they could get their hands on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.407" offset="4789081">And when they got close enough, they would throw them towards the marshals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.397" offset="4805068">When the front of this crowd, which General Walker was with, got in about 200 feet to the marshals, they fired another blast of tear gas and the crowd ran back, with General Marshal -- General Walker with them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1266.980" offset="5175380">Well, as I say, I think it's clear that under these circumstances where the case was tried, as I will point out in Louisiana, a companion case was tried, the jury there was asked for in the complaint to award the judgment of two million and a quarter against the Associated Press and they brought it back to verdict of $3 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.634" offset="5262002">So, it's pretty clear that in the climate of today in the civil rights field especially the question of truth that if it has to be decided by juries at this time, is going to be very inhibiting as far as First Amendment constitutional right is concerned, because newspapers and magazines, and television stations just will not be willing to risk judgments of this kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="1727.990" offset="7019416">For example, the Associated Press now has a bond of -- in Louisiana, over half a million dollars, in the -- in Texas I mean in Louisiana case, we have -- because the Times (Inaudible) also sued.</text>

            <text syncTime="1931.119" offset="7831928">And that in this case, if the Associated Press had written about the United States marshal, he would have had no cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.855" offset="7866932">The Associated Press says the same thing about General Walker who has been a 100 times more active in the field of civil rights than the single United States marshal, then he has a cause of action for $33 million and he's already has two judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.512" offset="7933492">So, as far as General Walker is concerned in this case, I think that there's no doubt about it; that the New York Times rule has to be extended to cover him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3666.970" offset="14775380">Member of the publishers of the Associated Press are engaged in business for profit exactly as our other businessmen who sell food, steel, aluminum or anything else people need or want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.572" offset="14833789">The fact that the publisher handle his news while others handle food does not at which I'll later point out afford the publisher a peculiar constitutional sanctuary in which he can with impunity, violate laws regulating his business practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.416" offset="14897110">One of the laws that regulate the practice of selling the news is that, thou shall not falsely defame or accuse thy name.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.673" offset="14930129">Now, we're dealing in this case as Your -- as this Honorable Court has recognized many times where a public debate it goes to the very essence, the very foundation of the survival of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.934" offset="14971193">The question is to what extent can an individual citizen debate with a newspaper, with the Associated Press, or the magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.631" offset="14997943">And I respectfully submit to this Honorable Court that unless coupled with the fantastic economic power of the Associated Press and its related news organs, there is coupled a financial responsibility, the news that those people sell to the world of the common drug on the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.469" offset="15069309">As I remember, one of the imminent writers in the early days of this great country of ours, made a comment that it is pureness alone that gives things at right.</text>

            <text syncTime="3785.690" offset="15250181">And I respectfully suggest to this Honorable Court that the greatest disservice that could possibly done by the Associated Press in this case is to permit them to manufacture and sell news without the trademark of their responsibility behind it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5461.134" offset="21952052">“Well, I told it the best I could think of it then”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5464.314" offset="21964696">In addition to that statement, there is that story written by Mr. Gregory of the merit, a merit in a newspaper, which is a local newspaper which we cite in our brief and it points out that Walker led a charge against the marshals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5480.053" offset="22027703">And it points out the good many other things that were said in the AP story.</text>
            <text syncTime="5484.268" offset="22044526">In addition to that, the UPI reporter who has said testified, and he testified at page 963 in the record, and here's what the UPI reporter said, “After the speech, Walker stood there for a short time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5499.589" offset="22105861">He's talking about the speech he made at the monument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5503.536" offset="22121639">Then he turned to his left and sat down to the monument to face the lyceum.</text>
            <text syncTime="5506.425" offset="22133133">That's the administration building.</text>
            <text syncTime="5507.870" offset="22138984">It took several steps up to walk and then when the two men caught up with him and moved up on the side walk and about that time, the people who would listen to Walker moved in behind him and followed with him, in behind him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5519.017" offset="22183497">And then a solid line formed across the campus with the general and these two people in the middle.</text>
            <text syncTime="5523.720" offset="22202305">They moved towards the lyceum but then I lost sight of them as they near the flagpole and about that time, teargas was fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="5531.612" offset="22233966">I would also like to comment briefly about Justice Stewart's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5535.806" offset="22250684">The articles complained of in this case, appeared on October 2nd and 3rd.</text>
            <text syncTime="5544.147" offset="22284016">General Walker's arrest was October 1st.</text>
            <text syncTime="5547.444" offset="22297287">There was nothing in the record at all about the arrest because it was obviously irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5556.502" offset="22333440">Counsel has suggested that that the reporter, the Associated Press, before they trigger the arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="5941.842" offset="23874873">This case which is here on certiorari to the Fifth Circuit raises another variant question of the scope of the rule declared by the decision in the New York Times Company v. Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5961.617" offset="23953972">This was a libel action instituted in the Northern United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia by the respondent claiming $5 million punitive and $5 million general damages for an article which appeared in the side the evening posts of March 23, 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="5990.897" offset="24071105">That article entitled, “The Story of a College Football Fix” and subtitled, “A Shocking Report of How Wally Butts and ‘Bear' Bryant rigged the Game Last Fall”, purported to tell a story of one George Burnett, an insurance salesman in Atlanta who claimed to have been accidentally, cut in on a telephone call from Atlanta to test the loser, cut in while he was making local call.</text>

            <text syncTime="6118.010" offset="24579553">Could proceed to give him in detail statements about the Georgia players' formations and place which he inferred was information that Butts was giving him about what Georgia was going to do in the forthcoming opening game of the 1962 Season which was scheduled to take place some nine days thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6149.743" offset="24706403">The telephone call that Burnett claimed to have heard was on September 13, 1962 and the game between Alabama and Georgia was to be paid -- played on September 22nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="6167.910" offset="24779128">At the end of this conversation or in the course of this conversation I suppose recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="6175.390" offset="24809012">Bryant would ask Butts specific questions and Butts would answer, “I don't know”.</text>
            <text syncTime="6182.149" offset="24836075">And Bryant would say, “Can you find out for me?”</text>
            <text syncTime="6185.692" offset="24850286">And Butts would say, “I'll try.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6189.026" offset="24863556">And then at the end of the conversation, Bryant asked Butts, if he would be home on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="6197.958" offset="24899291">And Butts said that, he would.</text>
            <text syncTime="6201.696" offset="24914233">The importance of that last statement being that it was proved by records of the telephone company that a September 13th call did take place from Bryant at the office in Atlanta, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="6224.711" offset="25006289">That Burnett had been trying to get on the phone to the Alabama or Athletic Office in Tuscaloosa.</text>
            <text syncTime="6234.770" offset="25046518">That -- and secondly, that on the following Sunday, there had been a telephone call of over an hour duration from Tuscaloosa placed by Bryant and charged to his credit card to Wallace Butts at his home in Athens, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="6258.411" offset="25141081">Now, they say again the publication on the basis of Burnett's story charged and they editors of the post affirmed the charged in an accompanying editorial statement that Butts and Bryant had fixed or rigged this game by Butts giving Bryant confidential information about the Georgia plays.</text>
            <text syncTime="6295.009" offset="25287471">The case in the District Court proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="6305.463" offset="25329371">Suit was filed almost immediately after the publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="6311.154" offset="25352046">Case proceeded on the defendant's plea of truth and that was apart from inconsequential denials.</text>
            <text syncTime="6322.361" offset="25396872">That was the issue in the trial of this case below the trial court charge in the conventional libel terms that the burden of proving truth was on the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6339.918" offset="25467089">Proof -- truth of the -- what the Court called the “sting of the libel”, viewing the sting of the libel as a charge that Butts had given Bryant information calculated to influence the result of the game either to influence to won or lost or to influence the score by which the game was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="6373.987" offset="25603448">I think the judges' words were calculated or likely to influence the result of the game.</text>

            <text syncTime="6463.071" offset="25959758">Now, I say the case presents a variant of the New York Times problem but I must deal first with the question, whether that issue is in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6477.985" offset="26019422">The point was raised immediately after the New York Times decision by Curtis on motion for new trial filed under Rule 60 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="6494.993" offset="26087445">This actually was a second motion, 60 (b) motion that Curtis filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6502.206" offset="26116284">The first one being based on newly discovered evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6507.401" offset="26137078">The District Court ruled on that motion on the merits and held that New York Times did not apply on the ground that the Athletic Director was the employee of the athletic association and thus, not within -- not an official within the ambit of the Times rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="6540.789" offset="26270616">I'll come to that, of course, in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6545.474" offset="26289319">On appeal, however, the majority of the Fifth Circuit of the court below did not pass on that submission but rather held that Curtis had waived the New York Times point, if it has that point, by not raising it earlier than the 60 (b) motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6573.303" offset="26400705">And in reaching its conclusion as to waiver, the Court gave weight to the fact that among the counsel for Curtis in the Georgia case or the counsel cooperating in the Georgia case, were Alabama counsel who had also been counsel for the Times in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="6600.825" offset="26510733">The Embry-Beddow Firm so that these lawyers knew of the submissions that were -- had been made in the petition for certiorari and in the argument of Times.</text>

            <text syncTime="7034.851" offset="28246831">Now passing to the merits, I should first state what the facts are that bear upon the issue as Athletic Director.</text>
            <text syncTime="7050.527" offset="28309525">The record shows that Butts was in general charged of the athletic program of the University of Georgia, subject as to policy direction to this athletic board.</text>
            <text syncTime="7065.016" offset="28367517">Well, if athletic association nominally board in conventional lingo which in turn was responsible to the President, Chancellor and Regents.</text>
            <text syncTime="7076.260" offset="28412552">It was a corporation introduced into the Atlantic management picture on a pattern that many universities have adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="7090.015" offset="28467513">The main motivation for it being that it freeze contracting from state audit and other red tape limitations that stand in the way of the operation of college athletics on the big time business basis college athletics now to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7115.079" offset="28567824">I say again as to Butts' position, he was appointed by this association, fitting into the picture of university management.</text>
            <text syncTime="7129.670" offset="28626129">In the way that it did, he was paid by the association with slight addendum out of university funds that I take it that had something to do with preparing a way for getting in the pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="7151.385" offset="28712960">Of course Georgia was a state university, the Regents are regarded and treated explicitly declared to be a department of the state government, the Chancellor and President or indubitably state officials and the athletic association has a majority of faculty on it who are chosen by the president of the university, complying thereby incidentally with the standard of the athletic association and particularly of the Southeastern conference of which -- which Georgia is a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="7193.874" offset="28882965">Now, we say quite simply that running the athletic operation of a state university puts a pressure in a position where criticism of his official conduct ought to be considered within the scope of the First Amendment and therefore, within the scope of the New York Times privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="7373.237" offset="29600392">I say that the mode of analysis is the one foreshadowed in the Court's delineated and foreshadowed in the Court's opinion in Times.</text>
            <text syncTime="7383.876" offset="29643024">That the first question to be faced is a question whether the publication, whether the utterance, is an utterance with which freedom to publish which the First Amendment is concerned with which is our concern to the First Amendment, to the purposes of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="7404.950" offset="29727242">I come back to what you said in the argument of -- in question, the 150 you remind counsel what you -- was starting with the First Amendment and that's where I started.</text>

            <text syncTime="7437.029" offset="29855556">This is an area that can be an area of enormous difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="7440.627" offset="29869976">It has been -- it's relatively young and the jurisprudences of the Court being only 40 years old or so.</text>
            <text syncTime="7450.495" offset="29909473">But given that difficulty, it seems to me that the question must be answered as a legal question that because of the subject matter of this publication, freedom to speak published is within the scope of what the First Amendment is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="7472.730" offset="29998393">Now, if the answer is favorable to that it is within the scope of what the First Amendment is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="7479.717" offset="30026292">That it seems to me that the considerations that led the Court in Times to conclude that strict liability is offensive to the constitutional guarantee that some amelioration of strict liabilities be at the statutory liabilities of the sought that had been imposed in many different areas or be at the 120-year-old rule in libel that imposes strict liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="7511.672" offset="30154188">That such strict liability is because of their inevitable effect on people who would publish must be mollified and the principle of mollification, the limitation of liability to knowing reckless falsehood seems to me precisely responsive to the conflicting values that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="7536.906" offset="30255125">As I said in my brief, it seems to us that that rule is in itself an accommodation of whatever public interest is being involved to justify the liability or suppression on the one hand and the claim of freedom on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="7555.913" offset="30331089">Now, it's less clear to me that the First Amendment is at all concerned with the gossip columns about who slept with whom in what hotel room three nights previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="7570.768" offset="30390544">And well, I have no doubt that this Court may have to face claims of privilege for such publications on First Amendment grounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="7651.658" offset="30714149">All of which we've allude to in the brief with the best materials we could find, argue for the privilege in that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="7658.776" offset="30742570">So, the -- what you've come down to, Mr. Wechsler, is that you would require the New York Times standards to be met in any area covered by the First Amendment regardless of the characteristics of the person who is liable, that is to say whether he is “a public official or public figure or not?”</text>

            <text syncTime="7689.334" offset="30864823">Now, I should have -- I should say, of course, that in this case, we believe that we should prevail on narrower grounds and that the decision in Rosenblatt is indistinguishable in any principle sense from the decision we ask for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7715.695" offset="30970253">There you had a Director of Skiing Area.</text>
            <text syncTime="7719.855" offset="30986867">Here, you have a Director of Athletics of a state university and realize that Rosenblatt didn't -- wasn't an ultimate holding for the plaintiff but it did send the case back.</text>
            <text syncTime="7732.435" offset="31037231">And the only theory on which we say that went fact is that if Rosenblatt established that he was in charge of the area that then it had to face the charge privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="7748.018" offset="31099507">Now, I know I should also have said, Mr. Justice Fortas, in answer to your -- final answer to your question that I do very strongly rely on Time against Hill -- on the decision on Time against Hill and supporting the general thesis that I advanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="7765.976" offset="31171396">Although, I realized the reservations in the Court's opinion there that issued in this case and others like it, deliberately and specifically left open.</text>
            <text syncTime="7778.819" offset="31222700">I nevertheless suggest that the very, very consideration that led the Court deeming that publication to be within the realm of First Amendment protection to be something that the First Amendment was concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="7796.831" offset="31294798">Telling people about the new play that or relationship to an actual episode in human life, a very logic that led the Court then to precede the necessity for New York Times kind of privilege and it seems to me, and I repeatedly reply in any situation whether is that type of public interest in the publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="7824.063" offset="31403677">And I would have as a final thought that this doesn't set the law quite as far adrift as it might seem to because the issue is very close to the issue that state courts have confronted under the fair comment defense in asking the question, whether this is a matter to which the privilege of fair comment applies so that there is a body of law, a body of thinking, judicial thinking that will be relevant in working out this subject in closed cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="7859.572" offset="31545783">For example, we have a fair comment case in New York that's cited in the brief that involved a high school football coach and the Court just -- and no doubt that the communities entrust in the performing to that high school football coach was something that could be published about.</text>
            <text syncTime="7877.574" offset="31617776">What we do say is that the conventional limitation on the fair comment rule that limits its availability to facts accurately states it's that it adds nothing to the plead of truth really, does not comport -- cannot comport with the policies of the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="8023.342" offset="32200829">But I would suggest this, Mr. Justice, even in the operation of magazine publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="8032.104" offset="32235833">There comes a point where judgment has to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="8035.415" offset="32249104">That the story has been adequately investigated to satisfy the publishers that it should be published.</text>
            <text syncTime="8042.614" offset="32277943">And how far it is prudent?</text>
            <text syncTime="8046.308" offset="32292676">Given the First Amendment interest and the weight of that interest, how far it is prudent to so cast the scope for the privilege than any jury second guesses that invited the second guess to every publisher as to whether the investigation was adequate or not, that's a question that would give me some pause.</text>
            <text syncTime="8068.172" offset="32380134">And I think the great virtue of the New York Times privilege as defined in that opinion is that it faces the question as essentially question in good faith of the publisher.</text>
            <text syncTime="8083.277" offset="32440529">Now normally, publishers functioning in good faith had no interest or motive to publish false.</text>

            <text syncTime="8236.040" offset="33051585">These are the notes that were in evidence at page 1075 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="8247.262" offset="33096516">Do these notes indicate that important information was conveyed or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="8253.809" offset="33122743">Well, there were six football coaches who testified, four of them testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="8259.959" offset="33147298">They thought this information was helpful to an opposing coach.</text>
            <text syncTime="8264.736" offset="33166420">Two Georgia assistant coaches said, “No, there's nothing here that would help anybody.</text>

            <text syncTime="8294.187" offset="33284180">But when I read that two of the coaches say that this contained the main formations that Georgia used in the game and plan to use, I can think that this is hardly a fabrication and when I read at the end that Bryant was going to call Butts on Sunday and then find on the record that following Sunday he did call him and all that came out only after the university investigation of this whole matter had begun then I am able to view what is even a possibility that this thing was a fabrication.</text>
            <text syncTime="8340.025" offset="33467559">But did the jury -- was the jury uncertain whether the information really helped Bryant, the great coach?</text>
            <text syncTime="8348.716" offset="33502354">It may have helped him only by telling him that it was nothing new that he knew nothing, didn't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="8354.924" offset="33527118">But it would be enough to explain the jury verdict that contrary opinions as to whether the information helped Bryant or not, left them on a state of uncertainty.</text>

            <text syncTime="8400.415" offset="33709140">I will speak briefly and address my remarks only to the question that is to whether Curtis waived any constitutional claims that may have had.</text>
            <text syncTime="8413.673" offset="33762116">Mr. Schroder will argue the merits of the case and whether or not -- and the reasons why Times v. Sullivan does not apply to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8425.015" offset="33807569">We contend that Curtis did in fact waive any constitutional claims that it may have had.</text>
            <text syncTime="8435.033" offset="33847589">The Court of Appeals held among things that Curtis did in fact waive those claims knowingly and that they obviously decided upon another strategy defense which they used.</text>
            <text syncTime="8455.842" offset="33930867">Now in reaching its decision, the Court of Appeals followed precisely the guidelines that have been fixed by this Court in determining whether or not there has been a waiver of a constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="8474.822" offset="34006727">This Court held in the case of Zerbst v. Johnson or Johnson v. Zerbst, I believe it is, decided in our brief that the guidelines for determining whether waiver has occurred is the intentional relinquishment of a known right of privilege and this Court said in determining whether the right is known.</text>
            <text syncTime="8505.465" offset="34129293">The Court expressed the need to examine the particular facts and circumstances in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8512.270" offset="34156565">Now, does the Court of Appeals also cited in his decision upholding -- holding wavier?</text>
            <text syncTime="8521.422" offset="34193136">This Court decision in the Yacus case, Yacus v. United States in which this Court said, “No procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a constitutional right may be profited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make any timely assertion of a right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="8544.344" offset="34284878">Now, what are the facts which -- and circumstances which brought the Court of Appeals to its decision that could just did waive any constitutional claims that they may have had?</text>
            <text syncTime="8557.364" offset="34336914">They are simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="8558.768" offset="34342557">They are clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="8560.371" offset="34348931">We said they are convincing and they are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="8563.601" offset="34361887">In early 1963, before the article involved in this case was published, Curtis Publishing Company published in article concerning Paul Bryant, the coach of the University of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="8576.738" offset="34414446">He sued Curtis on the basis of that article and on February 26, Curtis filed his defensive answer and pleadings in that first Paul Bryant suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="8591.357" offset="34472856">And Mr. Strubing here, general counsel for Curtis was in the Alabama case along with Mr. T. Eric Embry by the time of Beddow, Embry and Beddow and as mentioned by Mr. Wechsler, that prime was at that time counsel in Alabama for the Times in Times v. Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="8615.239" offset="34568464">At that particular time, the Supreme Court of Alabama had already decided the Times case and it was on certiorari to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8626.262" offset="34612558">The Court of Appeals pointed out in its decision that in the certiorari, Curtis made its First and Fourteenth Amendment claims identical to those which they are asserting here.</text>
            <text syncTime="8640.125" offset="34667938">Now, they filed that First and Fourteenth Amendment claims in the federal court in Alabama in that first suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="8647.663" offset="34698136">In addition to that, they also filed the public man defense or claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="8653.822" offset="34722795">Now, we have in Georgia a statute, a public man statute privilege which I will point out in just a minute that they did not even apply as a defense in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8666.928" offset="34775144">Now that was on early February, February 26th, one month later, approximately on March 23, 1963, the article that is here involved in this case was published by Curtis in which they called “Wallace Butts, Paul Bryant corrupt” and that they “fixed and rigged” the 1962 game.</text>
            <text syncTime="8696.097" offset="34891860">A request for retraction was had been urged upon Curtis.</text>
            <text syncTime="8701.371" offset="34912967">They did not make any retraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="8704.260" offset="34924460">Two days later, on March the 25th, Wallace Butts filed suit in the federal court in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="8712.295" offset="34956643">In that case, again, Mr. Strubing, who obviously had to be familiar of course with the First and Fourteenth privilege claims because he had just gone through it one month before in filing those claims in Alabama in behalf of Curtis in the first Bryant suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="8735.387" offset="35049012">In defense of the -- of this case, the Butts case in Georgia, Curtis did not file any constitutional claim defenses whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="8752.345" offset="35116826">They did not even file the public man privilege that was provided for in the Georgia law, although, they had filed the public man privilege claim in the Bryant cases in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="8766.070" offset="35171788">Within a less than a month after this suit of Butts was filed in the federal court in Georgia, Paul Bryant filed a companion case again in the federal court in Alabama, again of course represented by Mr. Strubing as general counsel for Curtis and Mr. T. Erick Embry of the same law firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="8793.827" offset="35282756">And again, they filed in the second Bryant suit, the First and Fourteenth Amendment claims and the public man defense again.</text>
            <text syncTime="8806.216" offset="35332284">The Butts co -- we say, that those facts conclusively show that Mr. Strubing, the general counsel for Curtis, was well aware of those Amendments, First and Fourteenth Amendment claims, as being a privilege to which Curtis was entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="8827.992" offset="35419429">Now, the Butts case came to trial in Georgia before either one of the Bryant cases came to trial in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="8839.661" offset="35466136">Mr. Strubing, we were delighted to have him, came to Georgia and for the trial of this case, he brought with him Mr. T. Erick Embry, counsel in the Times case, which was then before this Court and he also brought Mr. Roderick Beddow of the same firm from Birmingham.</text>
            <text syncTime="8859.371" offset="35544921">They sat throughout the Butts trial for over two weeks trial at the Curtis' counsel table along with its Atlanta counsel and at no time did they ever raise, did they ever request the Court to charge any constitutional amendment claims of privileges whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="9343.122" offset="37479967">I don't suppose it will accomplish too much of the stage of the argument for me to stand too much time on doctrine of New York Times and whether or not our client, Mr. Butts, is a public official within that definition nor whether or not the matter that was -- the subject of this magazine story was a newsworthy event.</text>
            <text syncTime="9384.716" offset="37646315">But before getting along to that portion of New York Times which if it does apply to the first two issues that is public official and newsworthy event.</text>
            <text syncTime="9404.311" offset="37724682">Clearly the way this case or this story was worked up and was investigated and published, clearly beyond in a scintilla the question of a doubt it would produce amount to actual malice, I want to say first that I do not concede.</text>
            <text syncTime="9428.093" offset="37819873">Certainly, Mr. Butts is not a public official within New York Times as New York Times has written at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="9434.458" offset="37845264">Now there had been decisions written since then Garrison, Rosenblatt and of course, as this Court stated, Time against Hill does not a libel case and is not to be considered by the bar as a libel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="9452.506" offset="37917466">So maybe the definition of public official has been somewhat relaxed since the decision by this Court in New York Times.</text>
            <text syncTime="9463.876" offset="37963024">But I would remind the Court that the arguments made by my distinguished opponent that Mr. Butts was working for a state university as an Athletic Director, to me it would make no more difference than if we were dealing with the Athletic Director and the Head Football Coach at the University of Notre Dame or at Yale University or at Harvard because they are not tax supported of institution.</text>

            <text syncTime="10116.858" offset="40574851">They said that Burnett had intercepted a telephone conversation five months previously between Coach Butts and Coach Bryant.</text>

            <text syncTime="10312.740" offset="41358420">Since the affidavit formed the real core of the story, except from some quotations from various people, most of which quotations was subsequently denied under oath at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="10335.911" offset="41451102">The record at page 39, question: “Other than what is set forth in this affidavit?”</text>
            <text syncTime="10344.847" offset="41486838">Now, I'm examining Mr. Graham in New York, he has this affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="10349.849" offset="41506900">But he has secured from Graham in Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="10354.552" offset="41525708">“Other than what is set forth in this affidavit, there was no discussion as to the substance of the conversation between Butts and Bryant?”</text>
            <text syncTime="10366.544" offset="41573669">Answer he says, “No.</text>
            <text syncTime="10369.699" offset="41586312">Just that he was he couldn't remember anything definite about it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="10373.346" offset="41600836">This is quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="10374.698" offset="41606269">He said “without his notes”.</text>
            <text syncTime="10379.094" offset="41623824">So, I say when I return into the article in the magazine about halfway down the first column.</text>
            <text syncTime="10385.368" offset="41648901">There is a paragraph which reads, “Butts outlined Georgia's offensive plays for Bryant and told them how Georgia planned to defend against Alabama at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="10398.820" offset="41702713">Now, did Burnett furnish you within a detail as to what offense of players was discussed?”</text>
            <text syncTime="10405.179" offset="41728209">Answer, “No.</text>
            <text syncTime="10407.245" offset="41736464">He just said that there was talked about this in which Butts mentioned specific time but he could not recall.”</text>
            <text syncTime="10417.032" offset="41775647">Now, the peculiar thing here is that the post editors and an editorial accompanying the article called it what I have just read to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10428.932" offset="41823190">That was an interpretation, had to be an interpretation of these notes or what was said that was recollected by months earlier because there's only one party involved and that is the man who is listening in.</text>
            <text syncTime="10442.623" offset="41877943">So, the only source for this inter -- for the statement of story could be number one, an interpretation of Burnett's notes by someone knowledgeable in football language.</text>
            <text syncTime="10459.151" offset="41944085">But it didn't have that because the post never got the notes before publishing the story.</text>
            <text syncTime="10466.779" offset="41974596">The only other alternative for an interpretation would be that by Burnett of what he heard five months previously given without the aid of his notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="10481.921" offset="42035200">But it must be remembered that on the very date of the intercepted telephone conversation Burnett, while everything was clear on his mind as to what he had heard and with his notes before him, told John Carmichael what he had heard and how he had interpreted what he had heard that Burnett whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="10514.199" offset="42164245">And he told Carmichael at that time and he so testified at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="10520.015" offset="42187546">That that soon after the conversation, we couldn't even decide which team to bet on because we didn't know based on what I heard who the favorite was or who the favorite should be?</text>
            <text syncTime="10539.417" offset="42265182">So we have Burnett interpreting the same conversations twice, right after they were over and again five months later, when he didn't have his notes and when the post was willing to pay him $5,000 for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="10565.248" offset="42368418">No wonder, the post didn't insist on seeing the notes before the publication and they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="10574.141" offset="42404049">No wonder they didn't want to interview Carmichael because his interpretation might differ from what this fellow put in his affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="10586.517" offset="42453577">No wonder they made no further check into Burnett's past, his history.</text>
            <text syncTime="10593.757" offset="42482521">They had what they had come to buy and they never even contacted Burnett.</text>
            <text syncTime="10601.507" offset="42513450">Now, if it please the Court between the time they bought that affidavit and before they published it.</text>
            <text syncTime="10609.922" offset="42547200">I represent Wally Butts, sent the post or telegram which reads in part, I'm reading from the record 777.</text>

            <text syncTime="10680.008" offset="42827546">On the same date, I set on and wrote a registered mail letter.</text>

            <text syncTime="10698.222" offset="42900376">He didn't even acknowledged receipt of them to me at that time and proceeded to publish the story as it has been written without making any changes and more important than anything, without making any additional investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="10722.757" offset="42998491">The reason I sent the telegram, I wrote the letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="10725.620" offset="43009985">Certain, it was not laying the basis for a libel suit because I was sincerely hopeful that no publication whatever be forth coming.</text>

            <text syncTime="10830.134" offset="43428049">Here's what they could have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="10832.379" offset="43437035">They could have gotten the notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="10834.399" offset="43445081">They wouldn't be withheld from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="10836.636" offset="43453962">They could have submitted them to an expert in football, who would have told them as the experts said at the trial, “There's nothing in here that could possibly constitute a fixed, a rigged, a sell out as the post has charge.”</text>
            <text syncTime="10854.463" offset="43525329">They could have asked for the film of the game.</text>
            <text syncTime="10857.304" offset="43536718">It was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="10858.909" offset="43543092">The jury looked at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="10861.016" offset="43551556">The film shows exactly what happened on each play.</text>
            <text syncTime="10865.722" offset="43570364">To be brief, the first three touch downs scored by Alabama as low as 38 to 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="10872.031" offset="43595546">First three touch downs was scored purely as a result, Georgia had lost to the sophomores, failures on the part of the players and the coaches admittedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="10882.239" offset="43636402">For example, I had offensive halfback, planned defensive halfback for Georgia and the in run by him and Joe Namath, now with just were in the touchdown phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="10893.649" offset="43682064">The second touch down scored when the Georgia's in, got a position as first varsity game.</text>
            <text syncTime="10899.220" offset="43704320">Certainly, there was nothing in those films that would suggest a sell out.</text>
            <text syncTime="10907.073" offset="43735771">That's second thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="10908.050" offset="43739638">Number three, they could have gone to the Alabama players and asked them whether there had been any last minute changes in the coaching techniques given them by Coach Bryant and they would have found that there weren't.</text>
            <text syncTime="10922.991" offset="43799406">Next, they could have call -- they could have interviewed Carmichael.</text>
            <text syncTime="10927.172" offset="43816124">Carmichael would have put an entirely different slang on this banded Burnett.</text>
            <text syncTime="10933.145" offset="43840052">And at the trial, Carmichael even testified that the notes that Burnett brought to the trial with him were not the same ones that he had after the telephone conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="10945.035" offset="43887595">And the post could have found that out just by interviewing him after telling him.</text>
            <text syncTime="10951.292" offset="43912673">They could have interviewed the lawyer for the athletic board, who is the one that has the notes and found out from him that Burnett lied to him when he first came up there about telling him he didn't have a record.</text>
            <text syncTime="10966.345" offset="43972859">And he found out that he did; that he promised this lawyer that he would not sell or keep on to trying to pedal this toward; that he wouldn't sell it.</text>
            <text syncTime="10976.833" offset="44014759">On the very next day, he was over in a Hotham Hotel with Mr. Graham selling it.</text>
            <text syncTime="10982.432" offset="44037224">They could have found that out merely by going to Mr. Bowwick.</text>
            <text syncTime="10988.063" offset="44059690">And certainly, they could have interviewed the principals involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="10993.583" offset="44081842">Coach Butts and Coach Bryant, I think they would -- American way of life I think that before you were convicted and condemned, you would are least entitled to be confronted and to be heard and right there be sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="11012.697" offset="44158224">When post went ahead and published this story after my telegram.</text>
            <text syncTime="11017.564" offset="44177763">It knew, because I was representing Mr. Butts so it should have known that it was in for a libel suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="11024.728" offset="44206393">I put them on notice it was false.</text>
            <text syncTime="11029.032" offset="44223634">I knew Mr. Bryant was represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="11032.383" offset="44237009">He was sued at Birmingham at the very moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="11036.411" offset="44253100">So when they paid, I say, when they pay Burnett the final $3,000 after they've got my telegram and run the story on his witness affidavit that did brought two more officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="11052.008" offset="44315481">And as the record will show, when he took the deposition of the editor in New York of the post, he had entered them pay or issued them memorandum just so it would purports to his stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="11068.348" offset="44380891">He is an incidentally very fine man.</text>
            <text syncTime="11070.834" offset="44390818">I'm not criticizing him but he had an editorial policy which he calls sophisticated mockery.</text>
            <text syncTime="11078.266" offset="44420493">He's going to have an expose type of magazine, this is the post, he's going to hurt people, hit people where they hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="11088.044" offset="44459677">So in the next memorandum and then I'm through, he said to his staff, “You're doing a great job as evidenced by six libel suits that are now been filed against us and not consider that as a yardstick of the occurring at my editorial policy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="11106.005" offset="44531461">So, if it please the Court, I would suggest or I honestly urge that the lower court be affirmed, all that the writ be affirmed.</text>

          <turn speaker="herbert_wechsler" startTime="11120.680" stopTime="11402.834">
            <label>Mr. Herbert Wechsler</label>
            <text syncTime="11120.680" offset="44590184">Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="11123.645" offset="44602096">I have a few points that I would like to answer in the brief time.</text>
            <text syncTime="11128.986" offset="44623412">Mr. Justice Fortas, on your question about the Alabama public man statute, may I direct your attention to page 50 of the petitioner's briefs -- brief on the merits wherein the Footnote 12 the authorities have brought together that indicate plainly that there was no defense of good faith under the public man section of the Alabama statute and it's quite indefensible really to put to the court that there is if further we claim, we settle by the cases cited in the last paragraph of our footnote that the privilege adds nothing to the plea of truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="11174.898" offset="44807105">You got to be right on your facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="11177.262" offset="44816509">The -- if you look at page 36 of the respondent's brief on the merits, you'll see that all they have to say against this is that in Georgia, the earlier of conflicting authorities governed.</text>
            <text syncTime="11190.963" offset="44871367">Well, you know there is that special doctrine in Georgia but I will simply say that it has no application here because these are high court cases, Supreme Court cases, and there the latest authoritative case would govern.So that's absolutely out.</text>
            <text syncTime="11208.219" offset="44940330">The second thing I'd like to say is that reference was made to Mr. Strubing that was here in his participation in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="11216.856" offset="44974916">His affidavit is at page 1340 of the record and where he makes clear that there was no deliberate intention to surrender any rights of the post in this pleading business but as I said, in my argument I don't regard that as major, any how.</text>
            <text syncTime="11239.871" offset="45066971">Now coming to the facts which I cannot and unhappily review in a minute and a half, may I at least direct the Court's attention to two points?</text>
            <text syncTime="11251.824" offset="45114723">First, even if Mr. Schroder was right and this was a clearer cases of recklessness as he thinks it is, he says it is, I submit that we've been entitled to go to a jury on it under a right of a basic point, under a malice -- proper malice instruction as the Court held in Rosenblatt and other cases that will reversed without ruling, and indeed in Time against Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="11289.356" offset="45264875">I can't believe that Mr. Schroder remains to argue that there wasn't a jury question here on malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="11297.414" offset="45297162">But if he does mean to argue that, then I must direct attention to the summary on pages 68 and 9 of our brief which indicates that we do not concur in his reading of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="11315.033" offset="45367589">For example, he said that notes were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="11318.583" offset="45381799">The notes were not available at the time when the post, the representatives were in touch with Burnett.</text>
            <text syncTime="11326.141" offset="45411997">Why weren't they?</text>
            <text syncTime="11327.396" offset="45417012">Because they'd been turned over to the university authorities by Burnett when he reported this on January 4th, the notes were in the hands of Mr. Cook Bowwick, the Counsel with the Athletic Board and the whole matter was being investigated by the university authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="11345.395" offset="45489006">Now, he says, “If we only have the notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="11348.611" offset="45501962">Then we would have known why.”</text>
            <text syncTime="11350.252" offset="45508441">Well, obviously from our point of view, we had the notes who would have confirmed our view that this conversation occurred and that Butts did give Bryant this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="11361.913" offset="45555148">That is the way we read the notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="11364.494" offset="45565492">That is the way they will read by Chief Coach Griffith, on the night when they were turned over to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="11371.132" offset="45592033">That is the way they were read by the Georgia University authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="11375.915" offset="45611154">We knew also that Butts have resigned precipitately which didn't exactly seem to be the action of an innocent man.</text>
            <text syncTime="11384.220" offset="45644382">We knew further that the matter was taken with the greatest seriousness by the University authorities and by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="11391.928" offset="45675207">Now, all those things were known that I say, I must close by the referring to the summary of this material at pages 68 the following our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="11401.614" offset="45713972">Thank you.</text>
