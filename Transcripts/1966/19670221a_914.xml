            <text syncTime="12.053" offset="151594">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.598" offset="173746">Very briefly, we have before us two cases involving bank mergers and dismissal of complaints brought by the Government involving interpretation of the Bank Merger Act of 1966 and more particularly the following provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.781" offset="246471">The Act provides that in determining whether or not to approve a bank merger, the responsible banking agency whose approval is required shall not approve any proposed merger transaction whose effect in any section of the country may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly or in which in any other manner would be in restraint of trade unless it finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.922" offset="411042">The statute further provides that in any action brought under the antitrust laws challenging a merger which has been approved by a bank agency, the court shall review de novo the issues presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.667" offset="470079">And it further provides that in any antitrust proceeding, the standards applied by the Court shall be identical with those the banking agencies are directed to apply under Paragraph 5, the paragraph which I just quoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.540" offset="537579">Now yesterday, I endeavored to discuss one issue raised by the Houston banks in their case, namely an issue -- a claim that the dismissal in that case was simply on the basis that the Government has failed to allege facts concerning convenience and needs rather than on the basis that the Government had failed to meet the burden of proof on both competitive needs and the competitive consequences and convenience and needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.323" offset="668714">Today I want to address myself to what we deem to be the two major issues on the case which are closely interrelated.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.735" offset="698284">And the first is whether the Bank Merger Act of 1966 contemplates that in an antitrust proceeding, the function of the court really is to apply a review standard to the determination made by the banking agency, that is to say the kind of review standard that would be applied, say by the Court of Appeals in reviewing the action of the ordinary administrative agency made on the basis of the full hearing and the full record.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.267" offset="820433">Second, assuming that this is not so, that it is the function of the court to make an independent determination and come to its own conclusion whether the burden of proof is on the Government to allege and prove not only the necessary anticompetitive consequences but also the -- a negative proposition that these are not out -- not clearly outweighed by the convenience and needs of the community.</text>

            <text syncTime="397.373" offset="1692818">I think our complaints were technically correct because the Bank Merger Act as I suggested yesterday does not itself create a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.486" offset="1745272">The cause of action is still an antitrust cause of action and what the Bank Merger Act does is as you've -- as you pointed out and as we all know is obvious indicate that in a antitrust action involving a bank merger, the court shall apply the particular standard that is set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.908" offset="1830954">Now, I find it little hard to see why the trial can't proceed on the basis of the complaint as the Government has drafted it, so long as everybody is aware of the proposition that I've just suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.651" offset="1905977">I think it makes a little difference to us whether the complaint reads one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.072" offset="1923636">I don't think it's a decisive question or one that has any material impact on the way that the case would be tried, nor does it leave the defendants unaware of what the issues are.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.316" offset="1996675">Now I would like to proceed to the question as to whether this statute gives to the antitrust court the task of simply reviewing the agency determination for the purpose of determining whether it was arbitrary, capricious or not, or whether it gives to the court it's normal function in an antitrust case of making an indeterminate -- an independent determination of the issues that are raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.875" offset="2130840">Now of course it is the Government's position that the Bank Merger Act clearly contemplates that the Court in many cross action involving a bank merger shall make an indetermine -- independent determination of the legality of the merger under the standards of the Act and not merely review the banking agency's determination to see if it was supported by substantial evidence or it was arbitrary or capricious.</text>

            <text syncTime="649.617" offset="2701876">And as a matter of fact, the statute that was involved in the Smithfield case which is cited rather heavily by appellees in both of these cases did not itself use the phrase review de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.918" offset="2767078">It used the word trial de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.785" offset="2778467">And I must say having read the case that I failed to see how it supports the position of the appellees argue that it does, to me it's manifest from reading the opinion that the court is using the words trial and review de novo interchangeably.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.331" offset="2840743">The statute as I said uses the word trial de novo, courts to review and will set aside the determination, it found to be unwarranted by the facts to the extent that the facts are subject to trial de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.041" offset="2899571">That was the statute the court was interpreting in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.458" offset="2913155">And later on, the court prior to remanding said, "We will request the court below, the District Court to review de novo the action of the Comptroller."</text>
            <text syncTime="715.563" offset="2965608">As I said it seems to me that as far as that court was concerned, there was no particular significance in using one word or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.651" offset="3001971">I must say that the Attorney General who existed -- a legislation which would have removed antitrust jurisdiction to the end would hardly calculate that they abused the phrase review de novo in his own proposed statute, if it had the consequences that the appellees now contend that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.417" offset="3109073">Now -- but for the problem Mr. Justice Brennan that you have just raised, namely whether there is any peculiar significance in the use of the word review as opposed to trial, it seems to us that the words of the statute clearly give to the court the responsibility of making its normal independent determination of the issues that are presented in an antitrust case involving bank mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.760" offset="3214399">The only difference being that the issues may be somewhat broader and somewhat different in response to the different standards of the Bank Merger Act directs the court to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.948" offset="3275212">We would also suggest that this consequence is made perfectly clear by the legislative history including most particularly the fact that bills wre rejected which would have either immunized bank mergers once approved by the banking agencies from antitrust attack or would have provided precisely the kind of review that appellees now suggest the statute the respondent asked did.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.169" offset="3396002">In fact, the original bill proposed by Senator Robinson, S. 1698 provided that -- it would have provided that the authority to approve mergers consolidations and acquisitions herein conferred on the Comptroller of the currency, the Board of Governors, and the court -- and FDIC shall be exclusive and plenary and any banks participating in any transaction authorized or approved under the provisions of this Section shall be and they are relieved from the operation of antitrust laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="1741.857" offset="7070804">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.263" offset="7088462">There have been six decisions rendered ever since the passage of the merger -- Bank Merger Act of 1966 by the trial courts, the federal trial courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.212" offset="7132244">Each of those six decisions is contrary to an adverse to the Government in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.553" offset="7165576">In each of those six cases, the trial judge held that the Bank Merger Act of 1966 was the controlling statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.552" offset="7209566">One of those six decisions is a three-judge court by -- in the Northern District of California, one Circuit Judge and two District Judges sitting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.070" offset="7251675">In the present case, the suit is brought under Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.860" offset="7282813">And the trial court passed strictly on pleading a question because the only issue before the court was on a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.438" offset="7317086">And properly so, on motion to dismiss, the only question is does the pleading state a claim on which relief can be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.210" offset="7360240">As a matter of law, does it state a cause of action?</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.498" offset="7377377">So the trial judge as the learned counsel for the Department of Justice have conceded, did not reach the question as to the weight to be given, the Comptroller's opinion and decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.894" offset="7430980">The trial judge was merely holding in this case, you have to bring the case under the Bank Merger of 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.555" offset="7461595">You have to allege in your complaint those issues, those standards which make up the test or the Bank Merger of 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.325" offset="7512691">Now, it's clear that the trial judge is passing on a pleading question and we have setout in our -- in the appendix to our brief, a colloquy between the court and the counsel for the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.688" offset="7562115">The Court said, "Well, the burden, I am not too much concerned about the burden of proof, but as to what is actually necessary for you to allege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.992" offset="7607359">That is what we are concerned about here."</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.968" offset="7623241">The court rather said, "I recognized full will that this is very important and serious litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.741" offset="7654379">And I have no more desire than Judge Clarie had to dispose of this matter on a matter of pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.908" offset="7683009">Normally of course we don't."</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.640" offset="7693981">Then he said to the attorney for the Department of Justice, "The defendants and the intervener as I understand it, such authorities are here seem to say, that it is necessary for you to allege, (a), that the effect would be anticompetitive, and (b), that it is not outweighed by the convenience and need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.062" offset="7787604">It seems to me as simple as that."</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.253" offset="7800351">Then he further said, "I think it is just a question as to whether or not you have alleged the cause of action or if you ought to amend and undertake to do so, if you haven't already done it."</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.406" offset="7853014">The trial judge almost solicited the Department of Justice in this case to come forward and amend the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.915" offset="7895019">And although the Department gave no indication that they had any desire to amend, when the trial court entered this judgment of dismissal, he gave them 10 days in which to amend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.506" offset="7945383">Now the position, if the court please --</text>

            <text syncTime="2021.167" offset="8188008">I understand the cases to hold the burden to be on the plaintiff, to allege and prove an anticompetitive effect of the merger, and further that that is not outweighed by the convenience and needs aspect of the matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2038.791" offset="8258539">It appears to me that the plaintiff has the burden to allege and prove, he was analyzing those authorities, he said those are what those cases hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.529" offset="8297514">But he said, the question before me on a motion to dismiss is a question of pleading, have you alleged sufficient facts for stated cause of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2123.300" offset="8596564">In view of the Bank Merger Act of 1966, does this complaint state a cause of action?</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.653" offset="8617984">I think that was the only issue before the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.581" offset="8637733">Now, Your Honor I want to submit that the position taken by the Department of Justice before Your Honors is entirely different from the position taken in these six cases in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.441" offset="8693112">The Department of Justice has taken a consistent position in the trial court that Section 7 governs Bank Merger Act by the bank mergers even since the Bank Merger Act of 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.068" offset="8759672">I think it is clear from the position that they're taking in the trial courts, they were seeking to have a determination such as was obtained in Philadelphia National Bank, in which this Court held that the Bank Merger Act of 1960 did not in any way change the substantive standards to be applied in a suit for violation of the antitrust law, this Court so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.209" offset="8860191">But in the Bank Merger Act of 1960, there was no provision that the Department of Justice and the courts had to follow the same test and the same standards that the Comptroller was required to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.809" offset="8926647">This Court recognized that fact to be true and said that the Bank Merger Act of 1960 did not change the substantive test to be applied in a suit claiming a violation of antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.864" offset="8974817">That was one of the main reasons for the passage of the Bank Merger Act of 1966, was to set forth and provide as the Committee stated in its report or the Banking Committee in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.064" offset="9031659">The bill would've established a single set of standards for the consideration of future mergers by the banking supervisory agencies, the Department of Justice, and the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.469" offset="9085262">And what was this single set of standards?</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.460" offset="9101249">The Court said, "It would include both the effect of the merger on competition and the convenience and needs of the community."</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.579" offset="9133641">Those are the two elements that make up the test and we submit that that has been carried forward into the statute of -- it was finally passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.727" offset="9170317">Whether they say these cases were brought in the trial court on an entirely different theory, we now find, the counsel for the Department of Justice say this morning and also yesterday, that we do belong -- we do not dispute, the Bank Merger specifies the standards to be applied by the District Court in any antitrust proceeding brought against bank mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.225" offset="9260283">The Government in no way has intended to dispute this by drafting its complaint in terms of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.849" offset="9290794">But if -- then, it's further said yesterday and today, if any court had merely requested us to amend our complaints to make reference to the Bank Merger Act, we would have done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.545" offset="9337501">But what was the -- what's been the position that's been taken to the trial courts from these cases?</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.802" offset="9358608">The first decision, the three-judge court case in California rendered before this suit was ever filed, the Crocker-Anglo case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.128" offset="9403852">The court set forth what the position of the Department of Justice was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.914" offset="9427048">In its opinion, the court said it is the Government's view that the new statute made no substantial change in the law or standards to be applied in passing up on the issues here presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.975" offset="9479293">The Government puts it does then, it quotes the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.262" offset="9496430">It is of course the essential position of the Government that the 1966 amendment to the Bank Merger Act has not resulted in substantial change in substantive antitrust law or in the standards used by the courts in determining the legality of bank mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.298" offset="9576573">But then the three-judge court in California said, "We find no difficulty in concluding that then you win that made substantial changes in the substantive law and in the standards to be applied in this case."</text>

            <text syncTime="2684.880" offset="10842885">Now in the Saint Louis Bank merger case, the trial court as here sustained a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.355" offset="10896802">And in the Saint Louis Bank case, the Court said the plaintiff, that is the Department of Justice, takes the position of the Sherman and Clayton Acts are still the only statutes applicable to this suit and that BAM of 1966 has an effect upon the Comptroller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.994" offset="10979349">In other words, in the Saint Louis case, the trial judge said that's the position of the Government, the BMA -- the Bank Merger Act of 1966 has an effect only upon the Comptroller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.078" offset="11015711">But as far as the judicial proceeding is concerned, it is only a Section of the Sherman Act and Section 7 of the Clayton Act which were applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.737" offset="11054268">And I on this case, the trial court sustained a motion to dismiss stating that the plaintiff's complaint does not beat -- meet the basic minimum standards of notice pleading in that it has not alleged a violation of BMA 66, the Act that applies to all bank mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.749" offset="11126366">So the court sustained a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.709" offset="11134203">The complaint in this case -- the bank -- in the Saint Louis case had gave the Government 20 days in which to amend and just to say it failed and refused to amend in this case, they have failed and refused to amend in the Saint Louis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.478" offset="11197315">Now, in the Provident Bank case in Philadelphia which will follow this case in argument, the trial judge said the court therefore finds that since Justice has definitelyrefused to try its case under BMA 66, the bank should not be subjected to the expense and inconvenience of a trial when the Justice refused to prove other than admitted facts to establish its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.929" offset="11303058">And likewise in the present case, the trial judge here says, "I get the impression you don't really want to amend and if you don't want to amend, if you want to stand on this one proposition so that Justice under Clayton 7 will still control mergers or any mergers of banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.842" offset="11394696">Anyone would say that you didn't overlook this allegation regarding to the Bank Merger Act of 1966, inadvertently or accidentally, it's intentionally.</text>

            <text syncTime="2852.410" offset="11512978">Under the heading, the offense charged, they have alleged, it appears on page 75 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.217" offset="11560208">They have alleged in regard to the offense charge that the two banks have entered into an agreement of merger and that such agreement is violative of Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.435" offset="11605138">And in the prayer, they had asked that the court adjudicate that supposed merger violates Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.114" offset="11639829">There is no reference whatsoever to the Bank Merger Act of 1966 in their complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.090" offset="11659682">There's no reference to the standards as set forth in the Bank Merger Act of 1966 in this complaint.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eugene J. Metzger</label>
            <text syncTime="3391.025" offset="13667453">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.331" offset="13684694">The issues decided by the court below in either the pleading question suggested by my distinguished colleague Mr. Searls nor the narrow technical question and secondary question on the locus of the burden of proof on the convenience and needs suggested in the brief of the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.921" offset="13755016">Rather -- it was the decision of the lower courts that Section 7 of the Clayton Act have been supplanted as the legislative test of bank mergers by the new, substantively distinct statutory scheme embodied in the Bank Merger Act of 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.028" offset="13827532">This standard was rejected by the Department of Justice and the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.278" offset="13852505">They flatly denied that the Bank Merger Act of 1966 had any substantive effect as Mr. Searls quoted from the Justice at brief in the Crocker case which was the first expression of Justice's position through their brief in the lower court in this case, the Houston case, which was the last expression of its opinion where they said and I quote from their brief below, Section 7 of the Clayton Act is still applicable to bank mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.785" offset="13962533">It has not been replaced or repealed by the Bank Merger Act of 1966, and the plaintiff is not required to plead or prove a violation of the Bank Merger Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.224" offset="14016240">Now, the point Mr. Justice Fortas' raised before is particularly relevant to the reasons why the Department of Justice has taken this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.213" offset="14060231">It was not an act of casual intransigence upon the part of Justice below that it only alleged a violation of Clayton 7, nor is it an act of mere whim that counsel here has changed his posture from that below to argue convenience and needs is the question rather than which is the applicable statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.550" offset="14149569">Justice needs an independent statute upon which to predicate the logic of its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.242" offset="14180289">If the Bank Merger Act of 1966 has supplanted Clayton 7, then Justice's suit must be predicated upon and taken from the Bank Merger Act of 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.445" offset="14237132">If that is so, the internal logic of that statute requires with us to considerate as a review of the statute and a review standard the Justice must apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.319" offset="14284675">It was for this reason that the court below suggested that the -- the Justice below suggested that Clayton 7 still applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.321" offset="14316648">They needed an independent statute to get them into court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.616" offset="14329814">They needed to say, "We don't need the Bank Merger Act of 1966, we must -- we can sue under our own statutory standards."</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.676" offset="14370043">Now we shall demonstrate that Clayton 7 no longer applies to banking and Justice's suit consequently to quote Judge Clarie below, lies within the ambit of BMA 66.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eugene J. Metzger</label>
            <text syncTime="3600.008" offset="14503372">No, let me explain this to you sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.934" offset="14515075">The Bank Merger Act of 1966 states that in any suit, you shall apply the standards of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.981" offset="14555303">Now let us take any possible instance in which a bank merger might arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.374" offset="14580903">The banks proposed a merge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.947" offset="14591143">No suit can arise until the bank merger -- the bank regulatory agency approves that merger since -- that is a requirement of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.424" offset="14637119">So we start from the premise that any bank merger as to which an antitrust suit is brought must be one which has been approved by the bank regulatory agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.235" offset="14676302">Now then we have two possibilities, either the bank regulatory agencies properly carried out the standards established in the Bank Merger Act or they did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.286" offset="14724472">Now let us assume the first case where the standards of the Bank Merger Act of 1966 were met by the bank regulatory agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.304" offset="14760626">That is, its determination was correctly that either the statute did not substantially lessen competition or that if it did that that was all the common public interest by the convenience and needs of the community to be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.140" offset="14819976">In that event, the Bank Merger Act of 1966 states that the courts must in the first instance apply the same standard and in the -- Section 7 (b), and Section 7 (c) of the Bank Merger Act of 1966 provides that in the event of the standards of BMA 66 have been made by the bank regulatory agency that the Department of Justice may not sue on any other action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.221" offset="14932302">Well, the net effect of that is, if the bank regulatory agency properly met the standards of BMA 66, no Clayton Act suit could be reached, no Clayton Act decision could be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.975" offset="14983293">And let's take the other side of that point, suppose that the agency was incorrect, and it could not, it did not meet the standards of the Acts, the court in applying the standards of BMA 66 as instructed in Section 7 (b) would so find.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.765" offset="15050480">They would find as a fact that the agency was incorrect and it should not have approved the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.354" offset="15080782">The statute, Section 7 -- Section 5 says, the agency shall not approve and then follows the test that we've just discused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.624" offset="15109831">Well, if the agency shall not approve and they did improperly approved and the court so finds in the first instance, it can now -- it may have never reached a Clayton 7 issue because its whole case is before -- is decided before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.070" offset="15167613">The Bank Merger Act of 1966 says the agency should not have approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.892" offset="15182973">The court finds the fact that it should not have approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.147" offset="15195930">Therefore it says to the agency and to the banks, "No, you may not go through with this merger since we find that the standards of the Act were not met."</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.113" offset="15231875">Then in any instance, we will never reach a Clayton 7 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.448" offset="15253191">Therefore, that internal logic makes it impossible for Clayton 7 to continue to apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="3837.574" offset="15453706">But let me say to you the legislative history which also demonstrates the same facts Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.852" offset="15478784">In the legislative history, we have the fact that the Ashley-Ottinger Bill which is -- which was essentially the bill was ultimately enacted, set down the same standards that are in this bill today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.647" offset="15529984">And it said -- it stated these standards in the terms which are set forth in the appendix of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3866.689" offset="15570108">The next day after the Ashley-Ottinger Bill was passed by the Committee, the Representative Royce proposed an amendment to the Ashley-Ottinger Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.685" offset="15626115">Now all his amendments said and the only thing it said was, "Let's have this standard of Section 5 (b) apply Sections 1 of the Sherman Act and Section 7 of the Clayton Act."</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.231" offset="15688286">That's the only substantive difference between Representative Royce's proposal and the Ashley-Ottinger Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.960" offset="15723186">Now that proposal of Representative Royce was rejected by the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.160" offset="15740008">And that they say, "The only difference between the two is the specific reference to Section 1 of the Sherman Act and Section 7 of the Clayton Act."</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.075" offset="15771669">Now, he proposed to amend 5 by also specifically stating that Section 2 is still applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.844" offset="15810748">Now of course that is already -- was already covered in Ashley-Ottinger by Section 7 (a) (b) and Section 2 (a) (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.827" offset="15842722">But, to the court -- so the congr-- the Committee said, "Fine, we'll accept your amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.623" offset="15857873">We'll accept your addition 5 (a)."</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.111" offset="15867800">It made no substantive difference by they put it in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3943.574" offset="15877622">The only thing of his proposal that he rejected was a proposal to specifically refer to the Act -- the action in the antitrust court as being a Section 1 of the Sherman Act or a Section 7 of the Clayton action.</text>

            <text syncTime="6053.127" offset="24315904">It provides that there shall be review de novo of the issues presented, not the determination made by the banking agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="6062.158" offset="24351953">Finally, it's clear enough to all that the review standard would amount to an outright repeal of the application of the antitrust laws to bank mergers and this Court has repeatedly held -- repeals by implication the antitrust laws are not likely to be implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="6079.115" offset="24419871">And we think certainly a repeal should not be implied where as noted in this Court's opinion in Philadelphia Bank, direct regulation of the banking industry does not extend that the prices charged for banking services and were accordingly the maintenance of competition is highly important for reasons also stated in Philadelphia Bank opinion which we think are completely valid competition in fact may even be more important in this industry than in others because of it's effects upon entry in other businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="6111.385" offset="24548916">And certainly finally repeal should not be implied or presumptive weight given to an immunizing decision that is based not on a full scale administrative adversary hearing with full opportunity for cross-examination of witnesses and other presentation of evidence were on the kind of summary proceeding that is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6131.728" offset="24630314">And very briefly again with regard to the legislative history, we simply point to the fact that several bills which would have done what the appellee's laim was done here were rejected by Congress and the bill that you have before you was passed.</text>

            <text syncTime="6515.185" offset="26164120">I mean, the basic claim that is being made exclusively by the appellees now in the Provident case or by the Comptroller's office is that what is involved here are issues which are just not suitable for determination by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6531.639" offset="26229948">Now I think really the argument breaks down into two parts, first that the banking agencies have greater expertise in assessing the various factual issues that might come up under the Bank Merger Act standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="6544.536" offset="26281566">And second on an issue I think should be kept apart and I certainly will discuss it but I want to set it aside for a moment that the balancing of competitive considerations against convenience and needs is a balancing of interest that is somehow ill-suited to court determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="6564.299" offset="26360560">Now, of course, we see no force in either of these contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6568.947" offset="26379160">Now, with regards to the expertise on factual issues, I think in view of what the statute clearly provides in our view and what the legislative history indicates, namely a desire on the part of the Congress, that the Court shall continue to exercise their functions and carry on an independent proceeding here and make an independent determination that it will not do simply to maintain that there is some greater expertise on the -- in part of the agencies that has to be shown that there's some reason to believe, the court simply cannot handle these issues and we do not think that is so.</text>

            <text syncTime="6660.089" offset="26743724">There are, as I suggested really two issues here or it breaks down into two parts.</text>

            <text syncTime="7000.159" offset="28103973">This position is the position the Government has consistently taken below.</text>
            <text syncTime="7005.380" offset="28124871">Let me just quote briefly from our brief in Houston, in opposition to the motion to dismiss and I quote page 8 of the brief, "Plaintiff does not mean to suggest that the 1966 Act has no relevance in this lawsuit or has no way affected the fair existing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="7022.426" offset="28193102">The 66 Act affects prior law in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="7026.009" offset="28207417">One, it sets forth standards to be applied by the banking agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="7028.987" offset="28219329">And two, directs that the court apply those same standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="7032.001" offset="28231346">Now I have further citations from our briefs and filings in both courts below but the chart of it is we -- well, our position is that what the Bank Merger Act has done has modified and supplied a new set of standards, the precise (Inaudible) meaning of which is yet to be determined in the cases that come up and in specific context but which leaves unimpaired and unlimited in any substantial way the role of the court in deciding the issues laid before it and making the conclusion of the statute that directs it to make is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="7074.279" offset="28400515">Now, and with regard to the kinds of issues as I were saying, it seems to me that all of the issues that have been mentioned in the appellee's brief in this case and the Comptroller's brief esoteric as they may sound in a way they were put can all be translated into issues which are the kinds of issues that the courts have repeatedly dealt with in antitrust cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="7105.706" offset="28526216">The courts have long dealt with all manner of issues bearing on the competitive consequences of mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="7111.515" offset="28549413">They have dealt with problems of market definition in both the product and geographical sense and some industries where that problem of market definition is at least equally as complex as it is in banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="7125.518" offset="28605419">They have dealt with claims that a merger will have pro-competitive consequences by providing a stronger competitor for existing larger companies, by permitting economies of scale, by providing a full line of products and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="7141.643" offset="28669994">The courts have had issues like this before them an antitrust cases whether the courts in any particular case have concluded that these are relevant or not is another question, but they are not issues that are foreign to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7154.790" offset="28722552">Now as I said, I think all of the factors that have been cited are translatable in the issues of this kind and let me just take for you two or three of the examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="7168.121" offset="28775842">Our frequent allegation is that the merged institution will be able to provide services which neither existing bank could supply or could supply them more efficiently.</text>
            <text syncTime="7181.835" offset="28830699">Now, you can't evaluate a claim of this kind except in terms of the market concerned by asking for whom those services are intended, whether those customers can currently get them from other sources, that is to say whether other banks providing them, and whether the addition of another supplier which allegedly the numerous bank, would they, will or will not materially improve the competitive performance of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="7211.273" offset="28948459">This is true for example of the issue raised by the appellee banks here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7215.218" offset="28964237">They claim that the merged bank will be able to provide a wider trust service.</text>
            <text syncTime="7219.988" offset="28983359">Now the significance of that can only be evaluated by asking how many other sources of trust service are there in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="7227.166" offset="29011989">How significant would the addition of this bank -- of this further bank be assuming it would be able to do better merged than unmerged.</text>
            <text syncTime="7234.834" offset="29042709">Let me take the question, the issue which is commonly relied on by the banking agencies in approving these mergers that the merged bank will have a larger loan limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="7245.532" offset="29085550">And therefore, will become an additional participant in the large loan market.</text>
            <text syncTime="7251.104" offset="29107806">Now this is just another way of saying that the merger will add a competitor in the large loan market and again the question is how important is this?</text>
            <text syncTime="7261.764" offset="29150438">And I may say parenthetically that one of the reasons why we have take -- we have made the guess and the prediction that the Bank Merger Act will not substantially affect results in these cases is that by and large as indeed parts of the Comptrollers' opinions point out, the large loan market by and large is already a highly competitive market in a higher numbers of banks from coast to coast participate so that normally the addition of one more bank that can loan $10 million as compared with six, is that adding any bank in which there are already a large number of sources competing vigorously for that kind of loan.</text>

            <text syncTime="7418.914" offset="29779048">I have here for example an interim report of Pennsylvania Banking Law Commission which asks for economists to study the banking system in Pennsylvania and what should have done about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7430.827" offset="29826696">And on this particular issue, one of the economists, Professor Philips of the University of Pennsylvania says there is little evidence beyond that's found in direct support of merger application citing the Philadelphia Bank case that large borrowers are in fact inconvenienced by having to rely on banks in other cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="7449.024" offset="29899421">Shopping for large loans is not uncommon and the incremental cost to borrowers -- of contracting banks in other cities are negligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="7456.892" offset="29930977">It is undemonstrated and improbable if the industrial growth of the state is in any appreciable way, adversely affected by the absence of multibillion dollar commercial banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="7467.717" offset="29974235">Now, I offer that again, not as proof of the proposition but simply to suggest that the issue that's posed there is one (Inaudible) in the competence and familiarity of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="7480.590" offset="30025749">Now, the example I was about to get to which I think boils down to this issue, is a claim that -- to rely it on the Houston case that the increased size of this bank will contribute to growth and employment, in this case in the Houston area.</text>
            <text syncTime="7499.138" offset="30099937">The Comptroller -- and I quote said in his opinion, "The failure of the Houston banks to keep paced with the growth of its area has led to unfortunate results.</text>
            <text syncTime="7510.452" offset="30145181">Cities with more satisfactory banking facilities can attract industry which needs large scale financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="7517.138" offset="30171930">Moreover, many local projects are simply unable to obtain financing due to the preference of large banks in other areas for projects in those areas."</text>
            <text syncTime="7529.348" offset="30220727">No evidence was cited to support these conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="7533.274" offset="30236505">And interestingly enough, later on in the Comptroller's opinion and this appears on page 115 of our brief, in dealing with the question of relevant market, the Comptroller says, "Banks in New York, Boston, Chicago, and Dallas and the West Coast entered the Houston area and obtained sizable loans."</text>
            <text syncTime="7552.745" offset="30314350">In 1957 Federal Reserves study for example report that New York banks alone held $375 million of loans to Houston borrowers, the largest amount of out-of-city loans made by New York banks that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="7566.582" offset="30369729">This intense competition from out of state bank has not evaded over the years but has in fact increased in vigor.</text>
            <text syncTime="7575.689" offset="30406092">Now, whether the Comptroller was right in the first place or in the second place again is not an issue, it seems to me that the fact issue as presented is not one so esotery that it cannot be dealt with in a judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="7592.249" offset="30472338">Now let me turn to the claim that the requirement of the statute that the court may have to balance, convenience and needs or probable effects on convenience and needs against any competitive consequences, somehow imposes upon the court a burden which is so foreign to foreign to it that it raises serious constitutional questions as to the appropriate division of legislative and judicial responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="7625.716" offset="30606190">I'm frank to say that we have great difficulty understanding the courts with this argument because what it's really saying is that courts cannot weigh and balance conflicting interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="7721.051" offset="30987577">It has been held at least, by at least one District Court and I think this Court has had occasion to rule on it at least in dictum, that under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, if there are anticompetitive consequences from a merger in any one line of commerce that alleged pro-competitive benefits in another line that may be affected by the merger are irrelevant, that is that the court in -- because of the statute cannot offset one against the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="7758.588" offset="31137729">It seems clear that to us, under the Bank Merger Act that this particular rule would not be appropriate in bank mergers.</text>

            <text syncTime="7788.649" offset="31257997">But that is one of the circumstances in which a court might reach that kind of a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="7794.975" offset="31283284">But the point I'm trying to make is that the decision under Section 7 as it stands depends upon the language of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7808.058" offset="31335633">And I have never heard anybody suggest that there would be anything unconstitutional for the court to have reached a different decision, namely to say that in evaluating a merger, pro-competitive consequences in one line may be offset against anticompetitive consequences as a -- in another.</text>

            <text syncTime="8899.482" offset="35701321">We -- our contention is that the whole tenure of the Act which is entitled a view to prevent the need for dissolution of banks indicates that this statutory stay is not to be dissolved except on a very heavy showing on the part of defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="8914.363" offset="35760776">And here, the statutory stays were dissolved not on the basis of any showing of that kind but concomitantly with the dismissal of the complaints.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frederic L. Ballard</label>
            <text syncTime="8940.121" offset="35863907">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8944.135" offset="35879894">I'd like to address myself first to a question raised by Justice Black -- seems to Mr. Justice Black -- what seems to me to be -- go to the heart of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8955.752" offset="35926392">As I recall his question it was, has anyone -- any court ever suggested that the kind of weighing, the kind of public policy, public interest determination which is made in this Act is beyond the ordinary competence of a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8976.827" offset="36010715">And of course the answer is clearly yes, that was suggested in the Philadelphia National Bank case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8983.716" offset="36038196">And I know that you are all familiar with the language but perhaps I will read it anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="8991.902" offset="36071006">We are clear however that a merger, the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition is not safe because on some ultimate reckoning of social or economic debits and credits, it may be deemed beneficial.</text>
            <text syncTime="9007.968" offset="36135267">A value choice of such magnitude is beyond the ordinary limits of judicial competence and in any event has been made for us already by Congress when it act -- enacted the amended Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="9022.467" offset="36193259">Now, in a nutshell Your Honors, our position is that when Congress enacted the Bank Merger Act of 1966, it restored that ultimate reckoning of social or economic debits and credits required that to be made and it required the court to take some part in that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="9053.310" offset="36316662">That brings me to the second point.</text>
            <text syncTime="9058.914" offset="36339022">I think it was Mr. Justice Black also who asked whether the Act allows the banking agency, either the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the Comptroller to approve a merger even though it would clearly and unquestionably violate Section 7 or Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="9085.493" offset="36445393">And the answer is perfectly clearly yes, there is a clear warrant in the statute for the banking agency to approve a merger even though it'd be an anticompetitive merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="9099.581" offset="36501713">And thus, as far as the banking agency is concerned, the situation is on all force with the situation before the ICC or before the Civil Aeronautics Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="9112.493" offset="36553331">The -- and we are in the same situation that you are in the seaboard, the ultimate decision here is not whether this merger would violate Section 7 or Section 1, the ultimate determination here is whether this merger is in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="9134.548" offset="36641520">Now, I have said that there is no doubt the agency has the power to approve such a merger and this brings me to the third question which are the question which both Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Fortas have alluded to and that is what finality should be accorded to that determination by the agency?</text>
            <text syncTime="9158.858" offset="36738800">Now, I feel this has -- there are two factors to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="9161.905" offset="36751026">One, how good is the procedure before the agency and what kind of a review procedure should there be before the court?</text>
            <text syncTime="9174.012" offset="36799404">Perhaps we can illustrate that best by the facts of this case by which I mean the Provident case as they are set forth in the rather extensive appendix which we have filed with our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="9191.661" offset="36870040">You will see that the commencement of an application is an economic brief which in this case ran approximately 60 pages long and in which the parties are directed to address themselves to the issues of competition and public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="9223.002" offset="36995427">Following this, the agency receives reports from the other agencies on the factor of competition but not the factor of public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="9236.257" offset="37048404">And I stress this because there is a tendency to feel that if one of the other agencies has called the attention to what it conceives to be serious competitive effects of this merger that then when the agency charged with the ultimate determination approves the merger that in some way it is overruling or disregarding reviews of the other agency, this is not necessarily so.</text>
            <text syncTime="9266.167" offset="37168044">The first agency which it rendered the advisory report is limited only to competition and does not express its views on convenience and needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="9278.575" offset="37217677">Now, the next step as far as the banks are concerned is to supplement their presentation and in our case we were not able to print for you the very extensive supplementary material.</text>
            <text syncTime="9295.042" offset="37283506">This material was designed to answer every question which the Comptroller had raised and to answer every question which the Federal -- apparently, the Federal Reserve Board had raised in its advisory opinion, we feel that it did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="9314.899" offset="37362918">Most of that material went to the Department of Justice, not all of it but all that we felt the Department would be interested in.</text>
            <text syncTime="9324.076" offset="37399698">Concurrently with this, there is an investigation which a -- is a private investigation by the banking agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="9335.438" offset="37445151">Mr. Metzger has indicated to you the general nature of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="9339.639" offset="37461974">The -- I believe that Mr. O'Malley will be arguing for the Comptroller in this case may go a little more -- deeper into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="9349.200" offset="37500217">I found in the hearings before the House Committee on S. 1698 at page 899 a long description of the investigative procedure conducted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="9373.359" offset="37596766">I think you will -- as you read this description, you will feel that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Comptroller, and the Federal Reserve Board make a thorough effort to verify the factual material that is asserted in the application and to find out what the effect of the merger will be on the community in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="9402.011" offset="37711391">Now, they do not hold a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="9403.793" offset="37718497">Routinely, they do not hold a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="9408.778" offset="37738454">They can hold hearing, but they usually don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="9413.786" offset="37758516">The reason why they don't do this is I think obvious, if you start to think about the kinds of issues that are before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="9426.982" offset="37811284">A bank -- first of all, a bank operates in a fishbowl.</text>
            <text syncTime="9432.563" offset="37833644">Its statistics, all the facts that are known to it are common knowledge to the examiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="9441.696" offset="37870111">When the examiners come in as they do twice a year, when the examiners come in for a special application on a merger, the bank tells the examiner anything he wants to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="9454.655" offset="37922043">So the facts at issue, the facts in an application are rarely at issue -- the deposits and loans, the ratios, where the bank does business, all these kind of thing are known.</text>
            <text syncTime="9472.178" offset="37992051">The second thing about a bank is it's a creature of confidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="9476.067" offset="38007620">It maintains its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="9478.831" offset="38018696">It keeps its depositors, it keeps its customers, only so long as they have complete confidence in the bank that they're dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="9488.024" offset="38055476">Now many of the factors that will be involved in any agency, in any merger, are factors as to which confidence is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="9501.959" offset="38111169">Of course, if you have a bank that is failing or floundering, the last thing you want is an evidentiary type of hearing at which that will be discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="9512.006" offset="38151398">But it goes much deeper than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="9514.534" offset="38161533">If a bank feels that the merger will improve the quality of its service, it is extremely difficult in an evidentiary type hearing to explain that without explaining at the same time that there is something substandard about its present service.</text>
            <text syncTime="9531.378" offset="38228929">This may boil all very well if you know the merger is going through.</text>
            <text syncTime="9535.073" offset="38243662">But if you don't know the merger is going through, this may just be the thing that will not only lose confidence for the bank, but make the service deteriorate further because the man and the bank who is -- department you have even indirectly run down may very well not be there the next day, he may find another bank that appreciates his services more.</text>
            <text syncTime="9558.246" offset="38336345">So there is excellent reason why the hearings have traditionally been dispensed with in bank cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="9566.914" offset="38371035">Now then, what does the statute do about this?</text>
            <text syncTime="9571.505" offset="38389426">And I'm now speaking about this statute as interpreted by the court below because that after all is the question in the Provident case.</text>
            <text syncTime="9580.380" offset="38424848">Judge Clarie had all these problems to wrestle with and he wrestled with them over a long period of time, and he came out with a interpretation of these -- of the Act which makes very good sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="9595.562" offset="38485661">Judge Clarie and this statute say, "Since there was no hearing below, we will afford a hearing in the District Court, not the Circuit Court because Circuit Courts normally don't take testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="9609.277" offset="38540518">We will have a hearing in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9611.656" offset="38550026">And that hearing, every issue that has come up in the course of the application can be reviewed and the parties are free to put in any in -- any testimony they want."</text>
            <text syncTime="9625.497" offset="38605406">Now, when we trench upon the confidential areas, I assume that the court will treat that in camara with all the confidentiality that is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="9635.979" offset="38647306">Now, Judge Clarie goes further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="9639.950" offset="38663189">He says that, "At the hearing the court will find the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="9645.224" offset="38684296">There is no question in this case that substantiate -- the substantial evidence rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="9649.856" offset="38702791">In this case, Judge Clarie ruled, "The court will find the facts only when you get to the area of discretion, whatever it may be, will the court vow to the Comptroller's expertise, the Comptroller's informed judgment."</text>

            <text syncTime="10490.838" offset="42066735">I wish that -- I wish I had more time to go into the question of what the nature of this public policy determination, but it is covered in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="10500.642" offset="42105919">Perhaps, this one question will illustrate it as well as anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="10505.069" offset="42123682">They had a discussion here about merger (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="10508.567" offset="42137684">And there was a discussion about -- well, if the loan isn't available in this city then it will be available in that city, and if it isn't available for one bank, it will be available for several banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="10519.630" offset="42181883">Now, this may be probably is the standard antitrust analysis of a market situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="10529.722" offset="42222216">Perhaps it's even an economic analysis if it not be a banking analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="10534.321" offset="42240606">To a bank, there are -- there is -- there are two forms of large amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="10541.427" offset="42269132">One is, when you are just the participant, when you just have a share of the amount and this is nice but it isn't, it doesn't -- it does not improve the quality of service of the bank very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="10553.016" offset="42315421">The other position is the lead position.</text>
            <text syncTime="10556.099" offset="42327751">In the lead position, you are the man -- if your people who work at the time (Inaudible), to work with the borrower, to decide what is the most appropriate form of loan to have, and whether they -- whether the financing should be in one piece, all the intricacies that are becoming more and more apparent in bank lending.</text>
            <text syncTime="10575.686" offset="42406118">Now, it's the biggest bank, that is the lending -- the leading bank in almost every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="10581.959" offset="42431195">We have cases in our -- in our submission here for the situation where a bank starts out as a lead bank and its men are getting this kind of training and expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="10590.308" offset="42464632">And then other banks are brought in because our bank can no longer satisfy the customer's demands and then bigger banks are brought in.</text>
            <text syncTime="10602.338" offset="42512697">And finally, they get a bigger share.</text>
            <text syncTime="10604.490" offset="42521370">And then, what happens?</text>
            <text syncTime="10605.962" offset="42527222">Our bank is no longer the lead bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="10607.826" offset="42534640">Now this is bad not only for our bank but for our community because the reputation of our bank as a leading bank, a bank with skilled personnel, expert in these situations, is what brings business to our community.</text>
            <text syncTime="10623.958" offset="42599215">More than that, that same expertise that they developed in these big situations are used in their smaller amounts, so that when we get edged out of the lead position, the quality of our service, the expertise of our people, our prestige, and our ability to serve our smaller customers all suffer.</text>
            <text syncTime="10646.803" offset="42690539">Now this is the kind of thing that the Comptroller knows, the Federal Reserve Board knows instinctively, this is the warp and woof of banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="10655.013" offset="42723453">It is not the kind of thing that a District Court knows, and with all due deference it is not the kind of thing that the Department of Justice seems to pay its attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="10664.076" offset="42759711">And it is the kind of thing that I think the Congress had in mind, when it said that a merger should be judged on the public interest, as the interest of the total community, weighing any anticompetitive needs -- effects against -- the beneficial effects in meeting the convenience and needs of the community.</text>

            <text syncTime="10822.784" offset="43394487">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10827.392" offset="43412982">I believe that the discussion up to this point has confused the concepts of competition and convenience and needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="10839.702" offset="43462196">The argument of the Department of Justice seems to be predicated upon the equation of competition in convenience and needs, for although the Department has conceded in argument that it considers and has always agreed in the courts below that the Bank Merger Act of 1966 has resulted in different standards or that it has accepted the standards of the Bank Merger Act of 1966, there is a serious question as to what they mean by the standards of BMA 66.</text>
            <text syncTime="10877.032" offset="43611512">For example in the Crocker-Anglo case in California, subsequent to -- that case was tried prior to the enactment of the Bank Merger Act of 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="10888.386" offset="43656965">Subsequent to the Act's passage, the three-judge court in the Northern District held a further hearing and invited all parties to submit additional evidence and at that time the Comptroller of the Currency intervened as a party in accordance with the right given to him by the Bank Merger Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="10908.184" offset="43736064">They also -- and by the briefs -- and in its brief, the Department took the position, "It is of course the essential position of the Government that the 1966 amendment to the Bank Merger Act has not resulted in any substantial change in substantive antitrust law or in the standard used by the courts in determining the legality of bank mergers."</text>
            <text syncTime="10932.416" offset="43833031">Again in the Crocker case, the Department told the court that the convenience and needs of the community to be served is but a reiteration of the failing-company doctrine long recognized as an integral part of subtle antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="10949.134" offset="43899904">Thus incidentally, this position was cited by the Crocker court in its opinion of October 6 which remanded the cases to the Comptroller for further findings, under the Bank Merger Act of 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="10959.733" offset="43942327">Now, is not adopted by the court in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="10965.437" offset="43965106">Again in the case of U.S.v. Third National Bank in Nashville which was filed prior to the passage of the Bank Merger Act of 1966, but tried fully subsequent to the passage of that Act, the Department again represented to the court that the standards probably codified the somewhat greater contours of the failing-company doctrine which was adverted to in the Philadelphia National Bank opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="10996.944" offset="44091120">And again in the Provident case which is now before the court and as a statement of position immediately prior to the dismissal of this action, the Department took the case that -- took the position that it was the solvency of banks which was to be weighed against the anticompetitive effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="11020.994" offset="44187355">So, the department has taken the position really that the Act has done nothing but impose a tougher anticompetitive standard upon banks or that has codified the Philadelphia National Bank case.</text>
            <text syncTime="11034.242" offset="44240332">Now we are somewhat concerned that the representation by the Assistant Attorney General that the Department has always conceded in the courts below that the standards of the new Act applied to bank mergers and litigation is nothing more than an assertion by him that Clayton 7 still applies in full force and effect for if the Bank Merger Act merely incorporates the standards of the Philadelphia National Bank case and the failing-company doctrine --</text>

            <text syncTime="11113.214" offset="44556204">I believe that the Department has taken the position that the -- there is no basic difference between convenience and needs and competition that each of the convenience and needs facts or determinations by the Comptroller, only those to competition, whether or not it's probably pro-competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="11132.129" offset="44631855">So in effect they are turning the terms of this Act and to -- direction to the Comptroller or the banking agency to weigh the anticompetitive effect of a merger against the pro-competitive effect of a merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="11148.107" offset="44695803">Now, this of course is negated by the terms of the Act itself where Section 4 of the Act specifically is the banking agency, the right to approve a merger involving a bank that is in danger of failing without asking the Department of Justice for an advisory report.</text>
            <text syncTime="11170.578" offset="44785664">As the banking agencies are required to ask in a case with a bank that it's solving, or whether it might be substantial, anticompetitive effects.</text>

            <text syncTime="11191.092" offset="44867688">And this goes directly to the constitutional issue which is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="11196.954" offset="44891199">The authorization of a merger by a banking agency is a function that under this Act is delegated directly to that agency by the Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="11217.393" offset="44972910">Convenience and needs means nothing more than competition, then obviously the courts have always been considered competent to assess competitive effects and it's properly a judicial function.</text>
