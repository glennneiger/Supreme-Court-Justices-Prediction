            <text syncTime="49.826" offset="303710">Application of Gault, Number 116.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.183" offset="317085">This case raises important constitutional questions concerning the extent which requirements of procedural fairness guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment are applicable to juvenile proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.212" offset="369225">Appellants, the parents of Gerald Francis Gault claim in particular that the Arizona Juvenile Code on its face and is applied in this case is invalid and failing to provide the following basic protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.729" offset="423351">The right to effective assistance of counsel, the right to adequate notice of the charges of delinquency including time to prepare, the right to confront and cross-examine the complainant, the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to a transcript and meaningful judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.548" offset="490538">These issues which we do raise and pass on below will be taken up severely in due course.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.323" offset="517705">In this case, Gerald Gault at age 15 was committed for the period of his minority that is for up to six years to the State Industrial School in Arizona after juvenile delinquency proceedings consisting of two hearings in the Superior Court of Gila County, Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.552" offset="590639">This appeal is from a decision of the Supreme Court of Arizona in a collateral action.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.977" offset="612268">That Court affirmed a decision of the Maricopa County Superior Court which after a hearing dismissed the petition for habeas corpus filed on Gerald's behalf by his parents Paul and Marjorie Gault.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.443" offset="666185">Gerald is still in confinement and has been for two-and-one-half years.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.437" offset="686143">The facts are relatively simple and yet it is not possible to be confident about exactly what happened with the original proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.489" offset="718326">The reasons is that although there were two hearings leading to the determination of Gerald's delinquency and his commitment, a transcript was not made at either one.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.848" offset="755837">The facts accordingly are based on the habeas corpus proceeding in the Maricopa County Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.812" offset="783632">At that hearing, it appeared without dispute that in the morning of June 8, 1964, Gerald Gault and a friend Ronald Lewis were taken into custody by the Sheriff's Office of Gila County as the result of the complaint by one Mrs. Cook, a neighbor of the boys about an allegedly lewd telephone call.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.812" offset="863671">Gerald at this time was on six months probation following an incident in February 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.917" offset="892092">At that time he was with another boy who has alleged to have taken the wallet.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.860" offset="907870">The other boy was confined and Gerald was put on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.327" offset="925738">After Mrs. Cook's complaint, the boys were taken to the local probation office pursuant to the Arizona Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.177" offset="953114">The probation officers Flagg and Henderson who have the authority of peace officers in Arizona decided to detain the boys for delinquency hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.911" offset="988014">And Flagg interrogated Gerald at some length during the evening of June 8 and the morning of June 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.563" offset="1014659">No notice of the detention or charges was left at the Gault home.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.206" offset="1033258">Mrs. Gault who returned form work at 6 PM on that day, June 8 was informed by her older son, through neighbors, that Gerald was detained.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.024" offset="1072441">And she then went to the detention home.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.347" offset="1081741">There she was told by Probation Officer Flagg, “Of the general nature of the charges,” and that a hearing would be held the following day, June 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.390" offset="1121970">No written notice of this hearing or the charges was given to Mrs. Gault at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.281" offset="1145480">On June 9, a petition charging Gerald with being a delinquent minor was filed by Probation Officer Flagg with the Juvenile Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.470" offset="1182260">This is on page 80 of the record of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.930" offset="1196157">This petition was filed pursuing to the Arizona Juvenile Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.491" offset="1214339">In the Arizona Juvenile Code, a delinquent child is defined in Section 8-2016 in the appellant's brief on page 3A.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.812" offset="1255612">Mrs. Gault did not receive notice of the petition and did not see it until August 17 when the habeas corpus hearing was held in Maricopa County.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.770" offset="1295527">A juvenile referral report an internal Juvenile Court document prepared by the probation office for the Court charged Gerald with making lewd phone calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.892" offset="1335965">This was prepared when Gerald was taken into custody on June 8, was completed after the hearings and filed with the Juvenile Court on June 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.120" offset="1372850">It too was not brought to appellant's notice until the habeas corpus hearing on August 17.</text>

            <text syncTime="354.434" offset="1522166">The juvenile received no notice whatsoever as far as the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.292" offset="1537526">There was discussion with the juvenile orally and he may have known the general tenor of the charges but the only notice that was given that was discussed in the record and discussed by the Supreme Court of Arizona with the oral notice given to Mrs. Gault on the evening of June 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.446" offset="1610146">On June 9th, the initial hearing took place in Judge McGhee's chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.479" offset="1630312">He was the juvenile judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.637" offset="1638985">Present with Gerald, his mother, his older brother Lewis and Mr. Flagg and Mr. Henderson, the probation officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.810" offset="1667615">No one was sworn, no transcript was made, and neither Gerald nor Mrs. Gault was represented by a counsel or advised of any right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.288" offset="1705545">With respect to Gerald's conduct that led to a finding of juvenile delinquency, there was conflict at the habeas corpus hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.968" offset="1736265">As stated in the opinion of the Arizona Supreme Court at page 84 of your record, “There was a conflict in the testimony at the habeas corpus hearing concerning what transpired at the juvenile hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="445.322" offset="1885686">Officer Flagg testified that at the juvenile hearing Gerald admitted making the phone call and using some of the obscene language.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.391" offset="1921944">Judge McGhee testified that Gerald admitted using some lewd words.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.824" offset="1943677">Following the hearing on June 9th Judge McGhee continued the case until June 15 because in his words, “I didn't know myself what I was going to do because I was not satisfied from the testimony there at that time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="475.601" offset="2006789">Accordingly, Officer Flagg did some more investigating until the 11th, he testified, “I talked to Jerry more to see if he would tell me any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.781" offset="2047540">I talked to Ronnie Lewis some more looking for a change of stories perhaps.”</text>
            <text syncTime="491.193" offset="2069170">Gerald was returned home on June 11th or 12th.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.023" offset="2084530">On that day Mrs. Gault received the note on plain white pages from Officer Flagg which said, “Mrs. Gault, Judge McGhee has set Monday June 15th 1964 at 11 AM as the day and time for further hearings on Gerald's delinquency.”</text>
            <text syncTime="512.643" offset="2154956">Signed, Flagg.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.458" offset="2162270">This was the only written notice of any kind that any member of the Gault family received concerning this matter prior to the determination of delinquency and a commitment of Gerald to the industrial school.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.828" offset="2211694">On June 15th the second hearing was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.640" offset="2222979">It was held in the presence of Gerald and both of his parents, Officer Flagg and Ronald Lewis, the other boy involved in the incident and Ronald's father.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.221" offset="2261326">Again, neither Gerald nor his parents was represented by a counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.536" offset="2278567">At the habeas corpus hearing on August 17 there also was conflict about what happened at the Juvenile Court hearing of June 15, again, the words of the Supreme Court of Arizona, “It was a further conflict in the evidence of the habeas corpus hearing concerning the testimony at the second juvenile hearing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="562.386" offset="2353904">Both Mr. and Mrs. Gault testified that no one accused Gerald of making a lewd telephone call, and also said that Gerald admitted nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.949" offset="2392148">But Judge McGhee said Gerald admitted making some of the lewd remarks although not the more serious ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.054" offset="2416598">At this hearing Flagg supported the Gault's version stating that neither boy admitted making the actual remark.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.656" offset="2450975">It should be noted that Mrs. Cook, the woman who had complained about the phone call was not present or called as a witness at either hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.336" offset="2481695">Officer Flagg had talked to her over the telephone on June 9th and Judge McGhee had not spoken to her at all when Mrs. Gault passed the judge during the hearing of June 15 while Mrs. Cook was not present saying that, “She wanted Mrs. Cook present so she could see which boy had done the talking, the dirty talking over the phone.”</text>
            <text syncTime="615.836" offset="2567690">Judge McGhee answered, “She didn't have to be present.”</text>
            <text syncTime="620.615" offset="2586812">On June 15th, Judge McGhee handed down an order containing no findings or facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.135" offset="2608964">The order simply states that after a full hearing and due deliberation the Court finds that the said minor is a delinquent child.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.439" offset="2642192">He ordered and says that the child's own good and the best interest of the state require that he be committed to the State Industrial School for the period of his minority unless sooner discharged by Due Process of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3015.589" offset="12166750">Now, of course if the parent himself were before the Court is a defendant, he would be entitled to a lawyer because on the theory that he couldn't defend his own case but when the child is in the position as the defendant, when the child is before the Court with up to six years of his freedom to be lost, somehow the Arizona Supreme Court finds that the parent can satisfactory act on behalf of the child as the lawyer would and as far as the suggestion that Officer Flagg act as the lawyer, the probation officer in this case it seems to us that this is even less realistic and less fair, there's a flat conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.394" offset="12322022">Flagg is the person who signed the petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="3068.774" offset="12379491">Flagg did not do a thing for Gerald Gault.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.547" offset="12390567">It's well established they didn't informed Gerald Gault of any of his rights, any of his rights throughout the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.195" offset="12421183">Instead, what he did try to do was to get a change of story as the record points out on page 49.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.448" offset="12450231">He was certainly acting as an adversary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.188" offset="12461098">In short, our position is with respect to the lawyer -- with respect to the various other constitutional protections that we believe to be fundamental that the absence of a lawyer does not mean that we'll have a harmonious informal, non-adversary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.008" offset="12524419">Instead it means that we'll have a one sided adversary proceeding, a one-sided adversary proceeding in which the cards are stocked against the child from beginning to end.</text>

            <text syncTime="5159.294" offset="20741601">Now, in this case, one of the ramifications of the individualized treatment shows that on December 9th of 1964, in other words about five months after he was committed, the boy was replaced in his home under what is commonly called our home placement program.</text>
            <text syncTime="5182.659" offset="20835015">And it's a conditional release where under many, many circumstances the boy is allowed to go home for a weekend.</text>
            <text syncTime="5189.233" offset="20861346">And then he is taken back to the institution for training, for development, for guidance during the week and allowed to go home.</text>

            <text syncTime="6289.160" offset="25260993">Mr. Parks was kind enough to relinquish some of his time to me that I might talk with you on this amicus on behalf of the Juvenile Judges Association of the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="6303.684" offset="25319090">There's certainly no purpose for me to walk over the ground to spend trying the work done by the counsel before me.</text>
            <text syncTime="6313.507" offset="25358378">I think my role here is that I did concede my role here as that of voicing my concern on behalf of those people, thousands of people who preside over and worked within the framework of the Juvenile Court system that a decision does not come from this case which would in effect wipe out our present Juvenile Court structures -- procedural structures.</text>
            <text syncTime="6346.125" offset="25488886">I think that concern arose out of the trust that was in the brief and in the argument, I believe, of the appellant, which in effect asked this Court to impose upon the Juvenile Court procedures the doctrines that the Court has laid down in Gideon, Escobedo, Miranda and so forth to apply those to delinquency cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6380.915" offset="25628066">It's easy to come confused in that distinguishing is that if you can distinguish between felonies misdemeanors and delinquencies, the state legislatures on all 50 states I believe having their wisdom in defining what -- how they're going to treat transgressions of the rules of good conduct in order that our society require to setup classes of these transgressions as felonies, misdemeanors and delinquencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="6422.200" offset="25793160">Now, we have always within this framework of the Juvenile Court system had always I may say it this way not considered what would ordinarily be a crime if committed by adult, a crime if done by a youngster.</text>
