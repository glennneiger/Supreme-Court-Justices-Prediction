            <text syncTime="490.303" offset="2064593">Now, the interplay of Section 162 (a) (2) giving this limited deduction and Section 262 which sets out the general prohibition against family and living expenses was before this Court some 20 years ago in the Flowers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.979" offset="2131257">That time, this Court granted certiorari because of a conflict between the Fifth and the Fourth Circuit as to the meaning and the definition of the term “home”.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.197" offset="2168142">Just as now, the Ninth Circuit using home in its ordinary and usual sense, referring to residents, so 20 years ago, the Fifth Circuit had used that same definition in the Flowers Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.948" offset="2215163">And in Flowers, the three conditions that were outlined by this Court as being prerequisites that must be met before the deduction could be taken were that the expense be a reasonable and necessary traveling expense that the expense be incurred while away from home, that they must be incurred in the pursuit of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.202" offset="2304188">Now without finding it necessary to resolve the conflict as to the definition of home, this Court found that the expenses from traveling from Jackson, Mississippi to Mobile, Alabama where the taxpayer in Flowers was employed were not incurred in a pursuit of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.639" offset="2373883">As to what triggers the deduction, the Court stated that a travel expense deduction could arise only when the employer's business forced the taxpayer to travel and to live temporarily at some place other than Mobile, the facts of the Flowers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.100" offset="2443786">While this Court has not defined the term “home”, the Treasury and the majority of the appellate courts have for many years treated home to mean the taxpayers' principal place of business or employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.608" offset="2497808">The Ninth Circuit says to the contrary, that home in this statute must be defined in its ordinary and usual sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.459" offset="2537200">I submit that dictionary definitions will give no extraordinary insight into this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.394" offset="2560920">While we are faced with defining home in a specific context of a revenue statute, affording a tax deduction against earned income.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.552" offset="2593625">And in the development of the meaning for the word “home”, I submit that it cannot be done in isolation but rather it must give purpose to the provision of 162 (a) (2) without ignoring the prohibition that personal living and family expenses are generally not to be deducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.149" offset="2667917">In accommodation of these two competing statutory concepts is what is at issue today.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.565" offset="2693622">For example, my residence is in Annandale, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.162" offset="2708041">I work at the Department of Justice's Tenth in Constitution in the District.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.498" offset="2725386">Now, if we were to use “home” in the ordinary and usual sentence, I would be encouraged to deduct the travel expenses coming to and from work because they're incurred while away from home, my residence, in the pursuit of a trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.840" offset="2790693">But clearly, this is a commutation expense that I incur.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.960" offset="2803231">And the regulations for many years have said that this is a prohibited deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.245" offset="2824338">Furthermore, this Court in the Flowers case gave these same regulations, the force in effect of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.860" offset="2846804">So clearly from the very outset, the word “home” has a tax meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.254" offset="2872404">I submit that is in the statute, it is a descriptor.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.511" offset="2897377">A place from which when you travel on the pursuit of your trade or business, certain tax benefits would flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.710" offset="2938232">Now, the legislative history does not shed much light on the definition of home.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.804" offset="2958608">But we do have a 45-year consistent Internal Revenue Service interpretation of the word, that taxpayers generally are entitled to travel expense deductions only when they are away from their regular place of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.619" offset="3025899">I submit that this definition strikes the necessary balance between these two Sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.269" offset="3048469">And it -- when the taxpayer is away from his regular place of business, this triggers the applicability of Section 162.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.081" offset="3095698">It allows the traveling expense to be brought about by the business exigencies of the taxpayer whether they'd be in the pursuit of this trade or that of his employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.959" offset="3135195">And it also rules out the deductibility of the personal or family living expenses which are not to be born by the public fisk as demonstrated by Section 262.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.152" offset="3183992">The Treasury's view provides an administrable rule that fits into this fabric of the law and it has been consistently interpreted since 1921.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.940" offset="3223176">Section 162 (a) (2) was intended to ameliorate financial hardship to taxpayers who incur un-reimbursed additional living expenses when they're traveling away from their regular place of employment in pursuit of business, in pursuit of trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.066" offset="3303633">It's administered so as to put this taxpayer on a parity with the man who stays at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.711" offset="3330173">And it strikes this balance to provide this limited exception to a rule against the deductibility of living expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.237" offset="3364342">Now, the Ninth Circuit's rule would allow deductions for living expenses while away from the residence on business with this caveat, unless it was reasonable to expect the taxpayer to move to a place -- to his place of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.597" offset="3433723">This I submit is a very subjective qualification and it raises a number of questions, was it reasonable to move?</text>
            <text syncTime="840.536" offset="3465488">Well, this could be a question of judgment values.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.633" offset="3485863">Was the housing in the new city adequate?</text>
            <text syncTime="848.235" offset="3496312">Was the climate such that it would not be deleterious to the family?</text>
            <text syncTime="852.015" offset="3511463">Or was the schooling such that it could equate with the school system from whence the taxpayers to move?</text>
            <text syncTime="860.029" offset="3543437">None of these judgment values are pertinent to attacks on income or the expenses to be attributed to its earning.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.636" offset="3573948">They're extremely personal in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.890" offset="3582934">And I believe the Ninth Circuit's rule would tend to reject the Flowers opinion of this Court, where the Court said, “Business trips are to be identified in relation to business demands and the travelers business headquarters, the exigencies of business rather than the personal convenience and necessity of the traveler must be a -- must be motivating factor".</text>
            <text syncTime="896.198" offset="3688155">If the taxpayer in hypothetical took the position that he could contract away his -- bringing his family, the example that comes to mind is a taxpayer in Los Angeles who was an engineer.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.504" offset="3749386">And he agrees in contractual dealings with a -- in Alaska construction company that he'll go up there for five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.188" offset="3788152">And furthermore, they want as a condition of employment that he leaves his family in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.675" offset="3818036">And to ensure that he stays for five years, they worked out an escrow arrangement with respect to his salary, to keep him there for that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.626" offset="3853876">Well, under these circumstances, the Ninth Circuit's rule, I would assume would say that it was not reasonable for him to bring his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.333" offset="3888671">It wasn't reasonable because he couldn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.941" offset="3899120">It was an impossibility by way of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.299" offset="3912600">Therefore, his travel at -- which was in the pursuit of business, would under those circumstances I would assume be deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.632" offset="3949902">He would have the living expenses of his family in Los Angeles and a separate set of living expenses while on Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.974" offset="3987310">I believe that this is his personal choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.201" offset="4000162">And that's the way that my hypothetical taxpayer wished to live.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.492" offset="4017298">And that it's no different than the Flowers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.337" offset="4028688">We submit that this is the applicability of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.595" offset="4045720">You look to the usual place of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.673" offset="4058049">And that you cannot take into consideration that the host of judgment values of a personal nature which may make a man bring his family across and not to bring his family to his place of employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1031.406" offset="4228995">Critical to the Ninth Circuit's viewing of this case was their question of whether the temporary verse is indefinite exception would apply to this case and they were quite critical of such an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.820" offset="4290644">They considered a more flexible test and their flex -- more flexible test would be if the taxpayer changes his -- he would have to change his tax home if there is a reasonable probability known to him that he may be employed for a long period of time at his new station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.595" offset="4357726">Well, this rule, I submit, doesn't square with the effort to equate home with residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.769" offset="4386461">The Ninth Circuit uses a concept of a tax home and under certain circumstances they would say that the place of employment actually dictates whether travel expense deductions could be claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.316" offset="4444662">The problem however of the temporary travel and I believe we must acknowledge that 15 months is not a period of time in which you would consider extremely permanent at that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.902" offset="4511013">But we contend that the question of the length of time that the respondent was away is not a relevant factor in determining this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.813" offset="4554585">Neither the length of time nor his intent become relevant because when he left Santa Ana, California, he cut all of his business ties with that base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.092" offset="4611741">And he was now stationed at Iwakuni, Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.542" offset="4629504">He had no business purpose to be away from Santa Ana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.362" offset="4648835">He was moved by the Marine Corp for a 15-month period to Iwakuni.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.213" offset="4668270">And therefore, there is complete cleavage just as there was a cleavage when he moved from Albuquerque to Santa Ana and from Santa Ana to Iwakuni.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.594" offset="4709752">There was the same cleavage when he left Japan and was transferred to Cherry Point, North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.592" offset="4745697">And in each one of these moves dictated by his employer, he terminated his business contacts with the community in which he was living.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.690" offset="4806092">The military officer's usual place of work is his permanent duty station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.933" offset="4827094">There is a place where he is assigned by the military and it's inherent in military life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.925" offset="4847052">The professional soldier's life is regimented to a degree unparalleled in civilian life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.681" offset="4870144">We certainly recognized the many military posts that are throughout this world.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.543" offset="4893550">And the frequency of transfer from one post to another is a constant factor in military life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.153" offset="4919986">The permanent duty station is not only clearly the place of employment of the military officer, but such a station has many of the attributes of a resident community as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.729" offset="4966275">Under those circumstances where the family or dependents are allowed to travel with the military man, base housing or quarters are provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.528" offset="5009533">Many of these stations or camps or bases have developed into self-contained communities where there are schools and churches and commissaries, PXs, dispensaries, clubs and post theaters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.469" offset="5057285">And these attributes, plus the system of tax free allowances makes the frequency of change of duty stations less burdensome.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.938" offset="5099081">So it is to give military officers who have a permanent duty station, a deduction under Section 162 (a) (2) for traveling expenses when they are away from where their family resides would be -- I submit it an unwarranted tax windfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.109" offset="5183822">And that conflicts with the purposes of Section 162 (a) (2) and Section 262 which in combination forbid the deduction of a normal living expense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2209.099" offset="8939813">I appear as amicus curiae in support of the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.890" offset="8982967">First, in answer to the question raised by Justice Fortas, I agree with Rogovin that the -- Captain Stidges orders assigning him to the Far East are not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.195" offset="9028106">There is in the record however the -- a Marine Corps procedure in such cases which became effective a few months -- while Captain Stidger was in Japan, which outlines the regular tours of duty of abroad of marine personnel and says that for a tour of duty where he was, his tour of duty will be 15 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.490" offset="9149315">Captain Stidger testified that before the Tax Court that when he went over there, it had the similar procedures had said 14 months and that he was increased a month while he was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.236" offset="9200306">As far as the meaning of the word permanent duty station.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.090" offset="9219741">Again in question of Justice Fortas, in Revenue Ruling 55-571, again I agree with Mr. Rogovin that that is a term appearing in the U.S. Code and it said in Title 37 on paying allowances of the armed services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.421" offset="9281076">And it pretty much says that whatever the Commandant said it is but it refers to a shore station or home port.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.794" offset="9318588">It obviously ties in it seems to me with tours of duty as outlined in the marine procedures so --</text>

            <text syncTime="2320.493" offset="9385357">And so the -- when the -- this Revenue Ruling about permanent duty stations which was first promulgated in 1955 and I think had no counterpart in any earlier ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.836" offset="9442722">I disagree with Mr. Rogovin, I don't think -- it certainly hadn't been announced before 1955 as the policy of the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.859" offset="9470830">When it says that an officer in the armed services on permanent duty abroad may not deduct his meals abroad whether or not he is prohibit from taking his family with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.583" offset="9525687">I think that was a completely new approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.669" offset="9538017">I think it undoubtedly was -- it got that word permanent duty station was taken over from the statute on paying allowances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.335" offset="9572707">And I think permanent in that sense meant 15 months or 18 months or up to three years in the marines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.393" offset="9600920">That -- this is the maximum tour of duty according to the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.928" offset="9623071">So I think permanent is -- in a text sense is a misnomer and I don't say any reason to use this permanent as distinguished from temporary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.458" offset="9653164">In the text sense, I don't see any reason to give any weight to what the pay in allowances provision of the statutes may say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.875" offset="9682840">How it may characterize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.860" offset="9710843">Now, back to the -- I agree generally with Mr. Rogovin's statement of the facts with one or two exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.191" offset="9756087">I think that Captain Stidger testified that he was ordered to the Far East rather than in -- rather than to Iwakuni and the marine procedures indicate -- confirmed that, the marine procedure reproduced in the record at pages 24 to 31.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.537" offset="9821497">And actually the -- he was not always at Iwakuni.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.786" offset="9834559">He moved around at good deal around the Far East and in the taxable year of 1958, the account of the year involved, he is claiming deduction for only ten of the -- ten months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.384" offset="9892864">And the record, the -- his itinerary reproduced in the record, page 16 of the record, if my addition is correct, it shows -- is correct, shows that he was only in Iwakuni during this taxable year for approximately 240 days or eight months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.152" offset="9955976">And so that I submit that he is for the other two months approximately of the deductions claimed, he was at other point -- other military post in the Far East.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.612" offset="10005817">And he testified he ate almost entirely at various officers' messes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.425" offset="10029119">And so I think that is somewhat analogous to Justice Fortas' query as to what happens if he is transferred from Iwakuni?</text>

            <text syncTime="2497.032" offset="10091499">He was out of United States a little over 11 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.753" offset="10110412">But he was only at Iwakuni eight months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.955" offset="10123160">And the itinerary at page 16 shows the rest of that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.773" offset="10134444">He was at other places in Japan and Philippine Islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.791" offset="10154506">He came back to California for two months in the middle of -- two weeks and in the middle of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.458" offset="10173210">So we do have involved here to some extent at least, say two months worth or two times $65 a month, the -- something very analogous it seems to me to the Revenue Ruling 571, that's the ruling reconsidered in the letter in the reply brief, something very analogous to a naval officer whose permanent base is considered to be let's say Iwakuni and he's considered to be on temporary duty afloat if he will, although he actually, I think he went by plane from naval station to naval station.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.837" offset="10330676">And I would think that as to two months approximately, that even Mr. Rogovin would concede that the deduction is allowed on any event, on anything --</text>

            <text syncTime="2740.628" offset="11065866">I don't think anyone would contend that we have involved here Captain Stidger's personal conveniences and necessities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.665" offset="11105991">It seems to me that I would rather read that as very much to the same at least not inconsistent with the position of the court below in this case that it all depends on whether or not it was reasonable for the taxpayer to move his family to where he went.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.537" offset="11193553">And I certainly think that in the Flowers case involving the railroad lawyer down south it would have been quite reasonable for them -- for him to move his family to his new post of duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.581" offset="11237648">So I don't think the Flowers case is really -- certainly no more as -- doesn't support the Government any more than the taxpayer if as much.</text>

            <text syncTime="2802.385" offset="11312880">Again, I think the majority opinion went out from procedural grounds and I don't believe that it's really took a position on the meaning of home or the meaning of temporary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.430" offset="11353109">The dissenting opinion of Justice Douglas in which Justices Black and Whittaker joined, it seems to me to say substantially what the majority of what the court below said and substantially what I tried to say in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.862" offset="11438791">The legislative history of this statute I think really doesn't throw much light on the meaning of it except for perhaps that these -- the 63 history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.737" offset="11494275">The 63 recommendation of the Treasury Department to Congress admitting there was a good deal of uncertainty in this area suggested that the statute be rewritten to be more definite and perhaps the salient feature of the proposed legislation would have been to impose an absolute limit of 12 months on temporary absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.144" offset="11623946">And I think that the fact that Congress rejected that legislation perhaps raises some inference that it didn't want any limit on 12 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.136" offset="11679953">Mr. Rogovin says the length of time is not relevant but I don't think that the Internal Revenue Service has ever publicly so stated in all the -- all their publications and indicated the length of time is very relevant and that they will very rarely allow an absence of more than 12 months to be treated as temporary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.466" offset="11785279">Now, to go back to the basic temporary rule which is perhaps important here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.478" offset="11805236">As I understand the Government's position, the service's position, it is that home is duly to be construed as meaning a principal place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.979" offset="11847241">But they recognized that if a man is only traveling for a short time of course or even if he moves to a new place of business but is only going -- only thinks he's going to be there temporarily, they recognized that that would be on -- it seems to me they recognized that it would be unreasonable to ask him to move his family and unreasonable to deny him the deduction for his meals let's say as a temporary place of employment in view of the duplicate expenses he has -- where he came from for his family and living expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.008" offset="11987362">And so that the Government's temporary rule started off as equitable, fair, and sensible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.440" offset="12025083">But they have -- I submit they have not followed it to its logical conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.873" offset="12038875">Some were along the line and they decided that they didn't want to extend it very far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.192" offset="12064162">They've been limiting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.010" offset="12071372">I don't know why.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.999" offset="12075342">They've generally say that it shouldn't be for more than 12 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.959" offset="12107212">And somewhere along the line, I think they've gone off the track.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.900" offset="12126960">I don't think that the period of time should be relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.547" offset="12153605">It seems to me even a man in the Far East for two years or three years prohibited from at least -- he's prohibited from taking his family and has duplicate expenses at home should be allowed to deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.563" offset="12217657">Mr. Rogovin says that the Government is relying here not on the fact that Captain Stidger was overseas for 14 or 15 months, but that's alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.632" offset="12261857">But that fact that he cut his business ties with the -- in California and had no business purpose to be away from California, I don't know what that means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.306" offset="12312639">The construction work as ruling issued by the Service in 1960 is to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.446" offset="12337194">It says that they will no longer consider whether the employer had a business purpose or the employee -- for what the employee did and they would -- and they will admit that if the employee -- they will admit that an employee may have a business purpose for moving his -- the places where he works.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.715" offset="12406262">And if there is an employee's business purpose, that's enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="3301.350" offset="13308740">Perhaps the -- perhaps an analogy to be considered in that connection is the case of the traveling salesman who is on the road virtually all the time and really has no place of business, no fixed place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.128" offset="13395884">Now, as I understand it, such a person is allowed to deduct his expenses for meals other traveling expenses on the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.393" offset="13436949">At least if he has a duplication in living expenses, at least if he has a family and a home somewhere and I refer to several cases to that effect are cited at page 20 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.871" offset="13494836">And all those cases indicate that it's crucial whether or not there is a duplication in expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.030" offset="13535483">Seriously enough, the Government publication of your income tax put out each year to help taxpayers make out their income tax returns says flatly that the traveling salesman may deduct their expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.986" offset="13615313">Doesn't even indicate that there has to be a duplication in expenses but all the cases insisted there'd be a duplication in expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.267" offset="13680410">Now, I don't think that Mr. Rogovin has argued too seriously the tax windfall point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.590" offset="13729729">I don't really think there is any tax windfall here for servicemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.833" offset="13746657">It's true that the base -- these basic subsistence allowances as far as subsistence are -- have always been treated as not subject to income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.804" offset="13794617">But Captain Stidger got the same pay in the Far East as he had in California, he got the same subsistence allowance in the Far East that he had while he was in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.092" offset="13855744">And it seems to me that he had additional expenses in the Far East for meals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.901" offset="13871000">These 10 months of meals at $65 a month which he didn't have back in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.407" offset="13897017">And that it's fair and equitable that he'd be allowed the deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.167" offset="13916035">And it seems to me entirely consistent with the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3481.735" offset="14030346">Now what about that a Congressman has his home in Tennessee, let's say, and he keeps -- maintains his home there.</text>

            <text syncTime="3577.796" offset="14414555">And that it would be reasonable to treat this as his tax home because it's where his family should be living, if they aren't living here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3688.963" offset="14859264">And in the light of that attitude and having lost at least one Court decision in the Tax Court on the point involving a Congressman, the Congress enacted this legislation which said that in the case of the Congressman, Washington shall not be considered as home but rather his home district.</text>

            <text syncTime="3831.632" offset="15429883">Well, I would say first that the case in the Fourth Circuit, the Bercaw case is quite distinguishable from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.302" offset="15464573">That involved a man who lived on a farm in Virginia and who would -- who was just enlisted in the army and was assigned to duty in somewhere in Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.751" offset="15514415">And he didn't see fit to move his family from Virginia to Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.649" offset="15533955">Now true, it was -- there was something said about -- sort of a shortage of - war time shortage of housing around the base in Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3866.050" offset="15567600">But certainly, he could have move closer to his base than his farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.373" offset="15592887">And I don't think that in that case, the deduction should have been allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.512" offset="15605426">I don't think the expenses were ordinary and necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.348" offset="15616815">I think on the balance in the aggregate, the family has a unit where undoubtedly better off living with the rest of the family living on the farm in Virginia, than they would have been regardless of the tax deduction in that consequences, if they had moved the family, say somewhere between Washington and this army post in Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.061" offset="15699571">So I don't think that that was a clean cut decision at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.121" offset="15723813">And I disagree with Mr. Rogovin when he says the 1955 Ruling went back before that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.940" offset="15763101">I think it was first announced in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.208" offset="15772191">I was thinking now of the part of the ruling that says that officers on permanent duty abroad may not -- are not entitled to any tax deduction even though it's impossible for them to take their families with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.227" offset="15820257">I find nothing before 1955 announcing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.358" offset="15836766">And indeed, very little reference to it after 1955 in the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.719" offset="15862262">In fact it's significant that in the appendix to my brief, I reproduced some excerpts from a pamphlet distributed by the navy, to servicemen which does not reproduce -- does not take that approach at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.535" offset="15929553">It simply says that they cannot deduct the expenses overseas for an indefinite period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.517" offset="15957452">And it's interesting to speculate on why they don't reproduce that 1955 Ruling.</text>
