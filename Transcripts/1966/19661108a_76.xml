            <text syncTime="35.837" offset="246680">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.063" offset="263607">Respondent commence this suit against the United States under the Tort Claims Act to recover for injuries he incurred in the cause of work he was performing while a Federal prisoner in the Federal Penitentiary of Louisburg, Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.771" offset="318464">The facts in the case are not in dispute for purposes of this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.643" offset="333928">In private life, respondent had employed upon occasions as a carpenter.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.157" offset="352005">While imprisoned he was assigned to do maintenance work.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.793" offset="370500">In the course of replacing a broken window some height above the floor, he lost his balance, fell and was severely injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.672" offset="398085">As a result of that injury, he applied for an award of workmen’s compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.941" offset="415117">Under the prisoners compensation statute, 18 USC 4126, he was awarded such compensation in the sum of $180 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.600" offset="453778">But as a result, this summer of Congress raising generally, the labels of workmen’s compensation paid throughout the United States to all non-government employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.208" offset="488155">He is now receiving $245 a month in compensation from the United States for the injury he received in the course of his prison work.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.398" offset="529011">The only question presented in this case is whether that prisoner compensation remedy is like all other workmen’s compensation remedies provided for any employee or anyone working for the United States, an exclusive one and therefore precludes this suit under the Tort Claims Act based on those very same injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.719" offset="602258">Or stated the other way, whether Congress intended the prisoner compensation remedy to be different from the compensation remedies provided for every other soldier or civilian employee of the government or any Federal employee of any branch with the government and that the prisoner was not only entitled to workmen’s compensation without regard to fault.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard S. Salzman</label>
            <text syncTime="159.660" offset="741961">The answer, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.444" offset="745200">The compensation is actually paid when he leaves the prison the theory being that compensation is to replace lost earning power and he had been earning.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.049" offset="779577">But that’s not entirely accurate, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.870" offset="786892">If the prisoner was employed in prison industries where he did get a salary, then he does continue to receive his pay while in prison even though he can’t work for prison industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.595" offset="821791">Industry is a job to the apprentice program, contain a small stipend and the prisoner may earn several hundred dollars a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.167" offset="848018">He continued to get that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard S. Salzman</label>
            <text syncTime="189.658" offset="862020">The compensation schedule follows the Federal Employees Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.369" offset="888874">That is the administrators had interpreted as meaning that for total disability, a prisoner who will receive the minimum award under the Federal Employees Compensation Act on a theory that the prisoner compensation statute says, in no event shall compensation under that statute exceed would be given to Federal employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.612" offset="961808">That’s $245 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.098" offset="975809">There is a schedule of benefits paid in a measure of the minimum wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.466" offset="993259">Whatever the Federal minimum wage is, it’s determined as to what the prisoner’s earning power, it’s a purposes of paying benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.011" offset="1015411">Indeed, this is also payments paid for lost of a member for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.085" offset="1031711">Off hand, I would assume that the prisoner would loss the hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.937" offset="1047071">I asked the prisoner to calculate that and receive about $8,000 in cash award, probably not in a lump sum benefit as a matter of a practice plus any disability benefits he would result from it.</text>

            <text syncTime="259.107" offset="1139754">As far as I can see, yes, Your Honor, is and it can par with Federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.658" offset="1153964">It’s applied without regard to negligence on the part of the prisoner or fault on the part of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.741" offset="1182386">Indeed, in many circumstances, the prisoners who were employed in jobs where they’re working alongside Federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.587" offset="1209762">For example, in some say, a prisoner is used to help collect trash and garbage and part of the crew is made up of ordinary Federal employees - GS 1, GS 2 employees – and when did we have a case where prisoner’s injured when he fell of the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.280" offset="1268485">And we would say that he is entitled to compensation, if he is totally disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.108" offset="1283845">If the employee had fallen off the truck, it’s quite clear that he would be entitled to compensation and would not be entitled to sue in court.</text>

            <text syncTime="500.847" offset="2106807">Had respondent been engaged in this – he was a carpenter – had he been engaged in doing the same sort of work, that is putting windows in a private dwelling for his private employer in his home State in Pennsylvania, he would have been entitled to an award, indeed he would be even restricted to an award of compensation under the Pennsylvania statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="522.275" offset="2192488">It’s also clear on the Pennsylvania law, we’ve cited that on our Brief, that he couldn’t sue his employer under the Pennsylvania law.</text>

            <text syncTime="535.144" offset="2243897">The award that prisoner getting in this circumstance was substantially less than he would get under the Prisoner’s Compensation system.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.382" offset="2276916">The Long Sherman’s Act, for example, provides a maximum recovery for the defendant upon salary of approximately $70 a week which compares something quite reasonable to the award being given to the prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.521" offset="2329475">I might add, of course, that like all compensation system, if the illegibility for an award to preclude suit against the prisoner, there’s no problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.709" offset="2366255">We could prove that third person was negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.281" offset="2376495">He was certainly be free to sue third-person account in tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.219" offset="2392273">All for that matter, if the Government came in and said, “You weren’t injured” or someone has found you weren’t injured in circumstances, we aren’t entitled to compensation; that if you are not covered by the system, then of course again, he could sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.438" offset="2441174">Indeed, I would point out that the decision below is quite unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.380" offset="2468864">But as far as we know, there is no compensation system anywhere in the United States where an employee is given the right both to attain his compensation recovery which is they say again is paid without regard to fault and without regard to contributory negligence and without regard to the other delays and tort litigations that always go on and it sometimes may be done by just settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.570" offset="2549635">And also, while retaining in one hand that absolute right to recovery, suing his employer, there may be nothing on to award about this system but allowing both recoveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.347" offset="2600730">But I would think that if Congress weren’t had intended to do that, it would’ve said so quite clearly that surely there was some indication of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="734.954" offset="3043140">We’ve pointed out that this Court has faced that problem on at least two occasions regarding Federal seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.975" offset="3067277">If you recall Yohansen and Patterson cases which came up in the circumstances of Federal seamen who were employed on Federal owned vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.505" offset="3109386">At the time of question seamen rangered in the course of their work, and they were entitled to an award under the Federal Employees Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.578" offset="3141674">At that time, the Compensation Act did not say it was an exclusively remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.683" offset="3158079">Moreover, to this day, the Federal Employees Compensation Act does not say in it’s an exclusive remedy for seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.235" offset="3184306">Nevertheless, this Court held it was an exclusive remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.853" offset="3198830">It looked to the background of what the Congress had intended to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.669" offset="3214085">And so no indication that on the legislative history of the Public Vessels Act to have substantive of the Act which indicated any Congressional intend to give additional benefits to those who already had some.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.022" offset="3259434">The court said it was understandable that Congress didn’t make the employees compensation system in exclusive one in so many words because at the time it was passed, there wasn’t any other remedy for Federal employees against the United States and it was necessarily the exclusive and only remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.579" offset="3329651">The same is true with the Prisoner Compensation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.358" offset="3340831">It was passed in 1934, some 12 years before the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.874" offset="3358908">When it was passed, it was the only remedy that any prisoner had.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.623" offset="3373850">It’s true that the Tort Claims Act is passed in 1946 and that under this Court decision in Muniz the prisoner could then sue under the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.388" offset="3416900">However, when the Prisoner Compensation system was expanded in 1961 to cover all working prisoners, it was done so at the urging of the Attorney General once again, I mean far from the Attorney General not one any ground it was, the Attorney General was looking for way to pay these prisoners who were injured and he pointed out correctly that it doesn’t allow Federal Courts at all held that Federal prisoners had no remedy under the Tort Claims Act and at least one of those cases of certiorari had been denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.954" offset="3527137">In these circumstances, he went to Congress and asked for the expansion of the prison industries remedy to cover all working prisoners to give them equal treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.114" offset="3567783">And the committee report which we’ve cited, the only one which is very important to page 21 on our Brief, pre-states what the Congress and the Committee thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.797" offset="3602578">Let me quote, “Presently, there’s no way on the general law to compensate prisoners injured while so engaged” – that is engaged in operation/maintenance work like respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.339" offset="3640717">Their only recourse has been to appeal to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.797" offset="3650539">And this Committee has reported number of private bills in the relief of such prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.861" offset="3670810">In short, when Congress expanded the statute, the coverage to include, contains the provision or continued the provision that in no event shall recover exceed that under the Federal Employees Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.795" offset="3714591">Surely, indication that it did not intend to treat this compensation system any differently than he treated any other one.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.175" offset="3744057">Now in United States against Muniz which is the other case, which my opponent here relies on very heavily, this Court considered whether a prisoner could sue under the Federal Claims Act and held unanimously that he certainly could.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.053" offset="3803617">And the opinion contains language to the effect that the presence of a compensation system does not necessarily preclude the suit in tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.866" offset="3838830">But we think, and I think we noted in the Second Circuit whose decision this Court affirmed and unanimously agrees with us because as you know, the Second Circuit was exactly the opposite result of the Court here, the Third Circuit did in this case and we think that language as we understood in consideration with the argument which the argument was then advancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.825" offset="3918660">The government suggested that Congress had provided a remedy in small area for some prisoners and this indicated the Congressional intent never if not to provide any other remedy for any other prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.466" offset="3961187">That was the argument which this Court rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.360" offset="3972786">But the Court didn’t consider whether the fact that prisoner had a compensation remedy and was in fact being paid, would preclude them from bringing suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.788" offset="4006536">Indeed, the Court didn’t mention Patterson, which is the seamen in this case, and then decided only a few terms or earlier, and mentions Yohansen only on the footnote in passing.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.512" offset="4045406">I think that the decision in Muniz doesn’t imply that one who has got an adequate, simple, certain remedy is also entitled to sue United States in tort in addition to that remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.935" offset="4103084">I’m not saying of anything wrong of that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.152" offset="4111966">It’s just that it’s unusual and it would be odd of the ordinary and one would expect Congress so said something like that and if you particularly wanted to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.457" offset="4149164">I might add that once again that no employee of the Federal Government at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.573" offset="4169644">Any branch of the government, civilian or military has this right for injuries incurred there in the course of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.165" offset="4196080">And indeed, as far as we know, the uniform general rule in Workmen’s Compensation Act is that what was covered by the injury can only sue to make third parties or someone, some person other than his employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1049.136" offset="4299943">Henry Winston, as a matter of fact, was a medical malpractice matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.762" offset="4318438">And more than that, the three cases which service granted was in conflict, none of those prisoners could have recovered under the compensation Act either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.042" offset="4355532">I might add that in this regard, that the Prisoners Compensation statute is probably consistent with all workmen’s compensation matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.304" offset="4384580">For example, if you are injured by you are employer when you’re not working, then you’re free to sue your employer in tort and you are also not entitled to workmen’s compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.757" offset="4430451">That’s precisely what would happen on the circumstances here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.151" offset="4443930">If this fellowmen had been injured to the full negligence of the government at the time when it wasn’t part of his employment, it wasn’t a risk of employment which is protected, then he would be entitled suit just as Mr. Muniz was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.721" offset="4498265">But there is nothing unusual about the rule saying he can’t sue when he’s already been given another remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.637" offset="4525955">I might add, as I mentioned earlier, that the remedy is fully comparable, we thought, to any other workmen’s compensation remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.723" offset="4562213">I would not say that it is as generous as given to full time Federal employees selected at least supposedly for that, in the merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.824" offset="4594709">But nonetheless, it’s not inadequate and it’s certainly matches the level of those keeping the ground level, threshold level given to Federal employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1558.169" offset="6336031">And that issue is simply this, has Congress, by reason of the enactment of certain sketchy and restrictive modes of recovery for inmates, thereby obliterated rights which prisoners have under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.148" offset="6415966">And, Your Honors, how can we say that this Prison Industry Fund is a compensation act?</text>

            <text syncTime="1592.160" offset="6471973">That is the exercise of discretion on the part of the office of the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.016" offset="6495483">But we don’t determine Congressional intention on what the Attorney General does.</text>

            <text syncTime="1615.521" offset="6565491">Justice Brennan asked the very pertinent question when he said, “Is there a compensation schedule?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.015" offset="6587434">Mr. Salzman answered the question by saying, “Well, the schedule provides that we can’t pay over the amount that is paid under Federal Employees Compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1635.392" offset="6644903">There is no schedule at all under the so called “Prison Fund Industry”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.921" offset="6667055">The Attorney General determines at his own discretion what will be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.102" offset="6683773">He’s paid as always $50 for the lost of a finger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.287" offset="6696521">He is paid as always $4,000 for the loss of a human life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.576" offset="6717628">Now, when Congress was considering the enactment of the Federal Tort Claims Act, 31 bills were introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.333" offset="6752737">Of these 31 bills, 6 bills specifically provided that prisoners should not be entitled to sue under Federal Tort Claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1936.434" offset="7849148">Now this Court has outlined certain references to consider in determining whether or not a so-called “Compensation Act” preempts or overwhelms some Act that Congress has previously enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.193" offset="7924172">In other words, we are to determine here whether or not this Prison Industry Fund is a substitution for rights which are given to prisoners under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.663" offset="7974013">And I believe it was Justice Clark in your Johansen decision where you decided this question queerly and categorically, you said before a compensation system replaces a specific right which Congress has given to an individual, the compensation system must be simple, it must certain, it must be uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.239" offset="8064293">But pardon me that was stated in the Paras decision which involves soldiers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.335" offset="8080697">In the Johansen decision, it was stated that before a compensation system can be presumed to preempt a Congressional enactment, it must be all inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.954" offset="8123225">Now let’s look at this compensation system and see in what category is at feast.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.660" offset="8142033">First, we have discussed that it is discretionary within the Attorney General, first, as to whether or not any award will be made and secondly, as to any amount which will be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.948" offset="8187173">Certainly, when the compensation award is to be made when a man is confined to a Federal Penitentiary, I don’t know what might happen after his release but he certainly does not have a right to a position, an independent position of his own choosing to determine the degree of injury, the degree of permanency – that is which were all determined while he was confined in the Federal Penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.330" offset="8284662">He has no right of administrate of appeal, a right which is clearly laid down in the provisions of the Federal Employees Act and also in the Soldiers Disability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.625" offset="8333876">And, of course, as Justice Fortas has clearly brought out, on conviction of any crime and we do know that a prisoner quite frequently may be picked up for vagrancy as he is released from a Federal institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.078" offset="8387688">At those points, whatever award is made or whatever award might be made is made determinate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.032" offset="8415483">Now, I know in the Pittsburg District it’s frequently the practice of some of our District Judges to impose one of the conditions for probation that a prisoner show/attend charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.779" offset="8466474">His failure to attend charge would be reason to subject him to violation of his probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.013" offset="8487476">That would terminate his compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2921.850" offset="11790817">Now, let me tell you why Congress intended to give prisoners this additional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.855" offset="11814745">I don’t think it’s a case of over indulgence.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard S. Salzman</label>
            <text syncTime="3303.852" offset="13318771">Mr. Chief Justice, I’d like to spend a few moments I have in answering the questions proposed by Justice, just a few words in closure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.465" offset="13353253">And, Mr. Justice Fortas, I’ve had the opportunity to check with the Federal Prisoner official who are in the courtroom and they say that “yes, the compensation is resumed upon whether the prisoner is released from confinement”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.857" offset="13398810">Secondly, regarding the letter which were sent to all the justices and our opposing counsel, the letter is quite accurate by both by practice and regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.988" offset="13431306">Total disability payments are geared to the minimum payments under the Federal Employees Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.163" offset="13451995">That was set out in specific sum of a $180 a month under the Federal Employees Compensation Act until this summer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.543" offset="13477595">This summer, completely independent to this proceedings, Congress raised to pay the minimum award of $245 a month for all prisoners who were totally disabled not merely Mr. Demko, who received a prison award.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.215" offset="13528273">Regarding the other amounts, the award for other benefits, it is a schedule of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.345" offset="13568711">In practice and under the regulations, they follow the schedule of benefit set out under the Federal Employees Compensation Act which is normally set out for the loss of a particular member; so many weeks of compensation and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.285" offset="13616462">And they used to compute the amount of compensation, the matter was in tucked to which the prisoner is entitled the minimum wage that an employee would be entitled to receive, any Federal Employee in the United States minimum wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.158" offset="13672051">That’s set out in the regulation too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.035" offset="13679470">If you’d like further details, I would be glad to send an additional letter to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.553" offset="13697546">I might add that the figures $50 and $4,000 relating to loss of finger and the death come from a letter which among other things is 12 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.794" offset="13734536">On top of that, the $50 for a loss of a finger probably was $50 for loss of a tip of an index finger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.953" offset="13755225">If you look at the Federal Employees Compensation Act, it has a different monetary amount for any particular joint or body loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.976" offset="13783228">The death of one, of course, it would be determined of how old the prisoner was and how much time it was like much longer his life would live.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.180" offset="13808097">Naturally, $4,000 it would for an older man would be unjust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.327" offset="13824711">If I may answer, Mr. Justice Brennan’s question, I think Mr. Justice Blacks question too about two remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.071" offset="13847698">The answer is, yes, that’s exactly what will be the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.142" offset="13859924">We agree and indeed we insist, because we insist there’s no tort remedy that this prisoner is entitled to compensation if he was injured in the cause of his work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.357" offset="13892838">And whether he win or loss the tort suit, he would get the compensation and that’s, of course, why the government –</text>

            <text syncTime="3455.767" offset="13926484">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.310" offset="13928573">If he’s injured in the course of work, but let me get one other point clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.105" offset="13943829">We’ve had a lot of discussion about, on my recount, about the comprehensiveness of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.729" offset="13962324">Well, I think the accurate is remedy is comprehensive in the same sense the Federal Employees Compensation Act is comprehensive in the same sense that every compensation statute is comprehensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.376" offset="14004851">If a man is injured while working, he gets compensation benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.288" offset="14024495">If he’s injured when his not working even because he is bitten up by a fellow prisoner for negligence, or for that matter runover by unrelated truck, a government vehicle, then he can sue as for tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.549" offset="14073605">That’s precisely Mr. Muniz’ situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.318" offset="14084681">Indeed, there are cases, I think with the recent case the Tenth Circuit called Browning v. United States, in which the precisely that matter came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.790" offset="14114565">The Federal employee was rundown by a Federal truck and the District Court found and the Court of Appeals agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.427" offset="14141106">He wasn’t working.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.210" offset="14144240">Consequently, he is not entitled to the compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.586" offset="14153749">He gets the Federal Employees remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.687" offset="14170154">I might add that the remedy as Mr. Justice Clark pointed out, is not insubstantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.635" offset="14189902">In this particular case, $75,000, I think this is reasonable minimum amount which is to be expected receive less, of course, because he has a sudden accidental death earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.797" offset="14238595">That would be paid, of course, over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.227" offset="14248312">Moreover, that’s something like three times the amount which the defendants would receive in the Perez cases, which this Court pointed out it was not an insubstantial amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.212" offset="14292198">I might add that in the army cases to which my brother makes reference here, it’s quite clear that no soldier was injured incident to service pursuant to the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.830" offset="14338696">The Brown case and the Brooks case upon which he cites, but times when the soldiers run further, they weren’t working and they held that they could sue despite the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.893" offset="14378924">We agree that in circumstances where the man is not working, he is entitled to sue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3671.107" offset="14787793">I have read nothing in respondent’s Brief and I heard nothing here this morning and this afternoon to suggest that in like circumstances in the State of Pennsylvania, private employer would recover.</text>
