            <text syncTime="70.875" offset="386905">I appear in behalf of all the petitioners in the four individual appeals which are consolidated for argument today.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.769" offset="430477">They are petitioners Hoffa, King, Campbell and Parks.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.652" offset="469974">These four petitioners were convicted in one joint trial on charges of jury tampering.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.240" offset="524309">To the affirmance of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals of those convictions, this Court granted certiorari upon one question.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.007" offset="579375">That question reads and I quote whether evidence obtained by the Government by means of deceptively placing a secret informer in the quarters and counsels of the defendant during one criminal trial so violates the defendant's Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights that suppression of such evidence is required in a subsequent trial of the same defendant on a different charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.476" offset="845302">The first of these was the trial of petitioner Hoffa in Nashville on a criminal charge, a misdemeanor charge of violating the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.179" offset="912071">That trial started on October 22, 1962 and continued on into December of 1962.</text>

            <text syncTime="234.968" offset="1043205">The second trial of the two trials referred to in the question upon which this Court granted certiorari is of course the trial in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.521" offset="1097435">That trial began and ended in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.445" offset="1121155">In that trial, the petitioners were convicted of tampering with the jury in the Test Fleet case which had occurred in Nashville in 1962 from October 22 then to December.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.441" offset="1201089">The question refers to a deceptively placed secret informer.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.081" offset="1227734">That reference is to one Edward Partin.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.812" offset="1250617">That is P-A-R-T-I-N.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.718" offset="1274232">It refers to evidence obtained by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.732" offset="1294294">This means in the context of this particular case incriminating statements, admission statements allegedly made by petitioners Hoffa and King during the course of the Test Fleet trial in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.345" offset="1372766">These as testified to by Partin in this proceeding secured the conviction of petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.855" offset="1410800">Beginning with October 22, 1962, the opening date of the Test Fleet trial, Partin according to his testimony in this proceeding heard and in summons, he said overheard the alleged incriminating statements petitioners Hoffa and King that he claimed in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.485" offset="1517275">Some of them he heard and some of them he overheard in the hotel suite which petitioner Hoffa occupied in the Andrew Jackson Hotel in Nashville during the whole course of the Test Fleet trial and which served during the course of that trial both as his home and as the headquarters for his defense in the Test Fleet case.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.965" offset="1643186">Finally, in providing context for the question presented here, we identify two Government officials, Department of Justice officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.384" offset="1708910">One you've already heard a little about.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.956" offset="1731166">That is Walter Sheridan, a non-lawyer layman who was assisting in the preparation and prosecution of the Test Fleet, the Government's Test Fleet case in Nashville in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.421" offset="1805040">The other Department of Justice official involved in this case is Mr. Frank Grimsley, a lawyer in the criminal division of the Department of Justice generally stationed in Atlanta, Georgia who was at all of the relevant times to this argument Mr. Sheridan's subordinate.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.351" offset="1924786">The question on which this Court granted certiorari presents five constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.033" offset="1963551">Three of those issues they are points Roman I, II and V of our brief, I will cover in this oral argument in the following order.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.259" offset="2024364">First, we urge that many of the statements, incriminating statements, allegedly obtained by party from petitioners Hoffa and King were barred by the Fourth Amendment as the immediate product of numerous illegal entries made by secret government agent Partin into petitioner office home suite without a warrant and when looking for evidence of jury tampering or other illegal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.510" offset="2201370">As we understand the Government's position, the Government does not deny the illegality of Partin's repeated entries into petitioner Hoffa's home suite throughout the duration of the Test Fleet trial.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="542.294" stopTime="551.363">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="542.294" offset="2272528">Well, that may be -- that may be agreed upon between you and the Government but I must say I have difficulty understanding why these entries were illegal.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_a_fanelli" startTime="551.363" stopTime="599.804">
            <label>Mr. Joseph A. Fanelli</label>
            <text syncTime="551.363" offset="2308786">Well, we say they were illegal because as I will develop in further detail on this argument Mr. Justice Stewart, we say that they were illegal because he was a government agent which was being hidden at the time of these entries into a home for the purpose of looking for evidence that they were therefore illegal because if the Government agrees with us an entry into a home without a warrant by deception and an entry into a home without a warrant by force are equivalents under the Fourth Amendment in view of Gouled and the (Inaudible) case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="599.804" stopTime="612.025">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="599.804" offset="2502614">Well, what if -- let's say when a plane clothes detective enters premises to investigate whether or not illegal activities, criminal activities going on there, is that an illegal entry?</text>

            <text syncTime="635.402" offset="2644929">Now, if your use of the phrase Mr. Justice Stewart, a private detective not connected with the Government.</text>

          <turn speaker="joseph_a_fanelli" startTime="663.986" stopTime="1118.511">
            <label>Mr. Joseph A. Fanelli</label>
            <text syncTime="663.986" offset="2759346">Well, Your Honor, what they do as we understand it, and I will advert further to this in the course of my argument, they at no point deny the illegality of the entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.818" offset="2822666">They go further than that and state that in view of the illegal entry had he been hiding in a closet these admissions would have been inadmissible but that the illegality of the entry is immaterial in view of the fact that the statements was directed to him which I will come into further detail later Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.670" offset="2934053">As I have already noted in answer to Mr. Justice Stewart's question, the Government specifically concedes that force is the equivalent of fraud for the purpose of Fourth Amendment entries into a home and it concedes further that the Fourth -- the protection of the Fourth Amendment extends to verbal statements although they argue as I will note later not this type of reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.645" offset="3069994">Second, we urge that the alleged incriminating statements testified to by Partin were barred by the Sixth Amendment as the very product and the very objective of Partin's intrusion as a secret government agent into petitioner office defense of the Test Fleet case.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.202" offset="3196217">The Government admits in its brief and this is not our understanding of it but a specific admission of the Government that Sheridan knowingly risked precisely such a violation of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.627" offset="3257866">In other words, as we logically understand the Government's position, the question upon which this Court granted certiorari at least so far as it concerns the Sixth Amendment is conceded in our favor if that question as stated accurately reflects the record and finally, in this oral argument we will urge that the testimony was barred, the incriminated statements as the product of a -- I've forgotten the phrase but Mr. Lewin used this morning as the product of a whole course of Government conduct contrary to the standards of fundamental fairness required by the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.584" offset="3505716">The remaining two issues, they are points three and four of our brief are concerned with Sixth Amendment rights that counsel with respect to this proceeding rather than the Test Fleet case and with Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination with respect -- directly with respect to this proceeding rather than the Test Fleet case and these if Your Honors please, we submit on our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.316" offset="3644688">The facts which must guide and govern decision on all the constitutional issues presented are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.566" offset="3713651">At the outset of a summary event, we should recall the identity of the principle persons who play a role in those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.553" offset="3761612">Petitioner Hoffa of course is the defendant on trial in the Test Fleet case beginning on October 22, 1962 and continuing on trial into the December of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.743" offset="3818350">Mr. Sheridan is the Department of Justice official as I mentioned a moment ago who was in Nashville throughout the Test Fleet trial assisting in the preparation and prosecution of a Government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.892" offset="3874983">Mr. Grimsley, his subordinate, Mr. Grimsley, a lawyer, his subordinate generally stationed in Atlanta from the criminal division of the Department of Justice and Edward Partin is no sort a policeman Mr. Chief Justice either state or federal at the opening of these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.931" offset="3975084">He is a local Teamster union official in Baton Rouge but prior to the opening of the Test Fleet trial on October 22, he indubitably became as the detail of facts I will recite in a moment would show.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.704" offset="4050213">He indubitably became the government secret agent and acted as such throughout the Test Fleet trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.823" offset="4090650">The opening scene of the facts is in late September 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.218" offset="4120221">It finds party in a Baton Rouge jail, local state jail upon a charge of kidnapping with bail having been denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.784" offset="4186467">At the same time, Partin is facing a 26 count federal indictment for embezzlement and state charges of man slaughter and forgery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.326" offset="4260655">Being so situated in late September of 1962, Partin tells the local state officials a story of a plot in the preceding summary by petitioner Hoffa to assassinate the then Attorney General Robert Kennedy and Partin as to speak with the federal officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.164" offset="4384057">As a result, Partin meets with Grimsley, the Department of Justice criminal lawyer, a lawyer in the criminal division at two conferences in early October held in the officers of the local state prosecutor between midnight and dawn on two mornings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.153" offset="4507982">These conferences were held at these unusual hours to hide the fact that Partin was an agent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1156.378" offset="4728874">Now, as we read Grimsley's testimony in this proceeding, Partin became the Government's informer at one of these early morning conferences on October 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.422" offset="4793031">Now, the Government reads it otherwise but in any event, we say it is not of any great materiality in this case because as we shall see in a moment in detail, there is absolutely no question on this record that Partin agreed with Grimsley in Atlanta on October 20th, two days before the Test Fleet case started that he would report evidence of illegal activity, jury tampering, witness intimidation or anything else of interest to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.939" offset="4983097">But to go back to the chronology of the facts, within a few days of these early morning conferences, Partin is released from jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.059" offset="5023640">By two long distance calls to petitioner Hoffa on October 8 and October 18, Partin successfully invites himself to Nashville to meet with petitioner Hoffa on October 22, the opening day of the Test Fleet trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.006" offset="5131368">The ostensible purpose of that meeting as stated by Partin in these telephone conversations and they are in the record was to discuss his personal problems with petitioner Hoffa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.857" offset="5202840">As soon as Partin knew that he was going to be in Nashville on October 22nd to meet with Hoffa, he immediately advised Grimsley and Grimsley advised Sheridan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.011" offset="5275460">Sheridan instructed Grimsley to give his Nashville telephone number to Partin and "to tell Mr. Partin that when he got to Nashville, if he saw any evidence of jury tampering or other illegal activities to call me."</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.118" offset="5391862">The quote of course is from Sheridan himself from his testimony in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.295" offset="5412551">So instructed by Sheridan, Grimsley got Partin to come from Baton Rouge to Atlanta to confer with Grimsley in Atlanta in October 28th which as I have already remark is two days before the opening of the Test Fleet trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.415" offset="5497083">At that conference, Partin agreed with Grimsley, to keep his eyes and ears open in Nashville and report to Sheridan on any attempts at witness intimidation or tampering with the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.066" offset="5587675">This is a testimony of a local state official who was also present at that conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.176" offset="5620067">As Grimsley himself sums it up, at that conference, he gave Partin, and I quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.799" offset="5658520">"Instructions to keep his eyes and ears open when he was in Nashville and if he heard anything of interest to call Sheridan."</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.461" offset="5709197">To use Partin's words on that conference on October 20th in Nashville with immaterial omissions, Grimsley "instructed me to discover or to turn in evidence that would substantiate a violation of the law or jury tampering or something like that."</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.239" offset="5844302">And Partin to use his own word for it know that in Nashville he was to observe, this is his word for evidence of illegal activities and as -- again as Partin himself puts it when and before he got to Nashville to the opening day of the Test Fleet defense, "I knew what I was looking for."</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.468" offset="5981288">When Partin was ready to leave Baton Rouge to go to Nashville for his meeting with petitioner Hoffa on October 22nd, he called Grimsley to advise him of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.028" offset="6043460">On his actual way to Nashville from Baton Rouge when changing planes at Atlanta, he called Grimsley to tell him that he was on his way and on his arrival in Nashville, on October 22nd, Partin called Sheridan to tell him, "I am here."</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.845" offset="6162787">The Government disputes this little fact, but record references 993 and 781 very surely substantiate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.491" offset="6205315">Now, the Government took many precautions to hide Partin's identity as a secret agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.068" offset="6239692">At the very outset of the Test Fleet trial on Partin's arrival in Nashville, Sheridan instructed Partin on how to communicate with him in order to make his reports to Sheridan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.967" offset="6311267">Partin was assigned with a codename of Andy or Anderson and Sheridan used the codename John Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.117" offset="6359855">For detailed reports other than reports by telephone, Sheridan was to pick up and deliver Partin on the street away from the Andrew Jackson Hotel where Partin stated and where petitioner Hoffa occupied the hotel suite which served both as his home and as his defense headquarters throughout the Test Fleet trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.823" offset="6470614">These arrangements made by Sheridan with Partin at the outset of the Test Fleet trial held throughout the trial as Partin met with Sheridan usually in his automobile, sometimes in Sheridan's Nashville apartment but through the back door and once in a (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.682" offset="6578134">According to Partin's long distance call arrangements with Hoffa, petitioner Hoffa, he was to be in Nashville to meet with the petitioner on one day October 22, to discuss his personal problems but Partin stayed in Nashville over some eight weeks for most of the trial days in the Test Fleet case which started as I have stated October 22nd and ended in December.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.647" offset="6710000">To do this, Partin made 11 round trip plane tickets, plane trips from Baton Rouge to Nashville.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.586" offset="6761723">He's getting evidence and reporting it to Sheridan was admittedly on this record a factor in the process by which his trip to Nashville for a meeting with petitioner Hoffa of one day became 11 trips to Nashville in a period of some eight weeks.</text>

            <text syncTime="1776.838" offset="7210715">Petitioner Hoffa's suite served as I have stated both as his home and as the home in which in conjunction with this counsel he was preparing and carrying on his defense in the Test Fleet criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.319" offset="7280619">In petitioner Hoffa's suite, his counsel conferred with him as to his defense, they interviewed prospective witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.082" offset="7323669">They prepared for the examination and cross examination of witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.090" offset="7347702">They discussed questions of law, and at the end of each day a process with which all of us lawyers if I may so Mr. Chief Justice are familiar.</text>

            <text syncTime="1833.435" offset="7437145">With one minor exception when Partin was unable to get a room on one of his 11 round trips to Nashville when he was unable to get a room at the Andrew Jackson Hotel with that one exception, Partin also stayed at the Andrew Jackson Hotel throughout the trial days of the Test Fleet trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.097" offset="7523767">On his first day in Nashville, Partin went to petitioner Hoffa's suite and thereafter he was constantly hanging around that suite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.115" offset="7583848">In the suite, he got people ashtrays, he moved chairs in the suite for the participants discussing their defense and he acted as doorman to the suite, sitting on occasion, outside, just outside the suite and on occasion just inside the suite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.400" offset="7692936">He even went so far has to deliver the morning newspapers, the early morning newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.611" offset="7721775">According to Partin himself, when he was acting as doorman, petitioner Hoffa "would tell me a lot of things that didn't pertain to the jury."</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.419" offset="7801083">With defense counsel in court everyday in the course of the Test Fleet defense, Partin was there everyday too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.875" offset="7850924">He ate with petitioner Hoffa and his counsel and went to -- back and forth from meals in the courthouse with petitioner Hoffa and his counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.509" offset="7905364">In some as the detailed facts show and there's six counsel who participated in the Test Fleet defense testified and we say without contradiction in this record the Government says there was a contradiction but at Partin's testimony as examined he never squarely denies any of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.552" offset="8009540">He doesn't remember.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.980" offset="8015287">He wasn't interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.103" offset="8019780">He has no recollection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.847" offset="8030751">As these six attorneys testified, Partin had an access to the defense counsel and Partin participated in and associated with defense counsel when defense matters and defense strategy were under discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.634" offset="8109955">The record is replete with examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.964" offset="8127195">Partin was present when defense counsel interviewed a number of prospective witnesses in the Test Fleet case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.059" offset="8175574">He helped assemble typewritten statements of their testimony, of their expected testimony as Sheridan explicitly admitted he told Sheridan about it and as the record sufficiently indicates Sheridan told the Government prosecutor, the man actually on the floor handling the Government's case in the Test Fleet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.359" offset="8304828">Partin discussed the selection of the jury with petitioner Hoffa and heard counsel, discussed it and in this connection reported to Sheridan that the defense was investigating the prospective (Inaudible) on the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.708" offset="8422170">He heard one of defense counsel criticizing other defense counsel as to what they were doing wrong in the case and what should be done in correction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.129" offset="8479848">He was present when the questions for jury voir dire were distributed amongst counsel and on three separate occasions may it please the Court, he interrogated defense counsel on what -- on various aspects of trial strategy in the Test Fleet defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.018" offset="8591444">Partin himself volunteers that he,"infiltrated" petitioner Hoffa and his counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.391" offset="8648913">As a result of the Partin infiltration of the Test Fleet defense, Partin without question got some defense information which he passed on to Sheridan in the course of his daily reports to Sheridan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.842" offset="8726758">Now, at this point I might take a moment to state, may it please the Court that there is some difference between the Government and us as to how much defense information he passed on to Sheridan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.423" offset="8801050">Although the Government argues at first for getting when they do get on the subject, they have to admit that there was some defense information passed on to Sheridan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.498" offset="8861341">With all of these going on, may it please the Court, Test Fleet defense counsel I mean with all of these going on, Partin and the petitioner Hoffa's headquarters telling Sheridan what's taking place there at the defense counsel, the defense counsel's consultations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.559" offset="8949635">With all of these going on may it please the Court, Test Fleet defense counsel suspected some sort of Government surveillance of the Test Fleet defense whether by wire tapping or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.501" offset="9017344">And as early as November 1, 1962, just nine days after this trial had begun they complained to the trial judge in Test Fleet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.044" offset="9079515">The Government flatly denied surveillance of any shape, type or form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.056" offset="9115564">The judge admonished the Government, this is at the Test Fleet trial court judge and I quote his admonition, "Certainly, the defendant is entitled to privacy in dealing with his own counsel and in communicating with his own counsel."</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.416" offset="9192991">That right will be respected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.338" offset="9208769">May it please the Court, the Government did not come forward at that time to say to the trial court judge as they now in substance say in their brief, your Honor, we have Government secret agent Partin in and around the Test Fleet defense and we know that that risked a Sixth Amendment violation of his right to the effect of assistance of counsel but Your Honor we are going to leave him there nevertheless because we think this is the way to protect the integrity of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.704" offset="9386193">While in Nashville, Partin reported to Sheridan on a daily basis and from time to time, he also reported to Grimsley by telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.609" offset="9445857">Neither Sheridan nor Grimsley ever gave Partin any definition or detail on what is jury tampering or witness intimidation or other illegal activity or anything of interest, the evidence he was to look for in Nashville and neither Sheridan nor Grimsley ever told Partin to keep away from the Test Fleet defense counsels and stop reporting Test Fleet defense information to Sheridan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.638" offset="9625893">So to use of Partin's own words, he reported "anything that I would have seen."</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.244" offset="9692348">Hence, Partin's reports to Sheridan on the results of his activities in the midst of the Test Fleet defense covered two types of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.962" offset="9743235">One, Test Fleet defense information, and two the admissions of jury tampering which he claims to have heard or overheard from petitioners Hoffa and King.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.599" offset="9805720">Now, while Partin was carrying on this job, this course of conduct as the Government secret agent in Nashville from the very opening day of the Test Fleet trial to its very end, he was at the same time as the Government's secret informer and agent reporting to the Government on a matter or a bribe of a completely unrelated Government official and an official of National Labors Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.278" offset="9952528">And after the Test Fleet trial was over and when the grand jury inquiry in respect to this proceeding was in progress, Partin as he testified in the trial below reported to Sheridan that one of petitioner Hoffa counsel was advising all prospective grand jury witnesses to claim the Fifth Amendment and giving them a form for the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.248" offset="10116368">It is a fair indeed in our view inescapable inference from this record that Partin in carrying on his work as the Government's secret agent did exactly what the Government told them to do no more and no less.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.384" offset="10204871">At page 701 of the record, Partin says that he did not keep notes of the time, dates and places of the alleged incriminating admissions to which he testified because Sheridan did not tell him to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.814" offset="10318660">At page 778 of the record, Partin says that he can precisely remember the claimed incriminating admissions and not remember any help discussions amongst counsel of jury selection because it was jury tampering that Sheridan told him to remember.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.615" offset="10425866">And at page 1011 of the record, Partin revealingly says in connection with his relationship to Grimsley and to Sheridan, "I figured that they knew well enough what they were doing if it was suggested or even hit it I would have done what they said do, now I would have some syntactical difficulty," but the "they" there in its context is Sheridan and Grimsley.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.540" offset="10577481">I come to the matter that bears upon the question you asked a few minutes ago Mr. Chief Justice the matter of compensation to Partin for his work as a Government agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.197" offset="10632129">It is the fact in this proceeding that today in the fall of 1966, Partin has never been tried on any of the criminal charges he faced in late September 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.600" offset="10721782">Now, the problem that offers a number of explanations for each of these and why it wasn't tried in our view, we think it may well be a case that the lady does protest too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.132" offset="10819897">It is the further fact that the Department of Justice paid Partin's wife a monthly sum of $300.00 for a total of $1200 in the period after the Test Fleet defense, after the close of the Test Fleet trial and before the beginning of this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.505" offset="10933373">These sums were in exactly the same monthly amounts as Partin was required by court order to pay to his wife for the support of his children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.575" offset="10993664">By written order of Mr. Sheridan in the Department of Justice the sums involved were paid out of a confidential fund by check to Mr. Grimsley, Mr. Grimsley then cashed those checks bought cashier's checks and sent them to Mrs. Grimsley without showing in any way the identity of its sender.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.402" offset="11132949">Did I -- to Mrs. Partin, sent them to Mrs. Partin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.937" offset="11147160">Did I say Mrs. Grimsley?</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.129" offset="11151862">It was a slip of the tongue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.819" offset="11158653">Grimsley sent these cashier's checks to Mrs. Partin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.909" offset="11191045">Now, the Government says and let me interpolate there is no question about the facts I have just stated upon this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.445" offset="11237125">But the Government says that these payments in behalf Partin to his wife were made for expenses that he incurred not in connection with the plane trips that you were inquiring about Mr. Chief Justice but in connection with other trips that he made to various cities in the country to consult with Department of Justice counsel in connection with the preparation of his testimony in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.544" offset="11369514">But Partin never submitted a statement, voucher or bill for any of these claimed trips and it is interesting to note in connection with the subject that I touched upon a moment ago that the reason he did not do so is that Sheridan didn't tell him to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.979" offset="11475257">And secondly, Grimsley although he tried and he made an affidavit I think it appears in this record sufficiently indicated its original form in the record, he had about a half sheet of paper and he tried to relate these monthly payments to what the trips might have cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.032" offset="11567522">He finally admitted that he was unable to do this and that the sums paid to Mrs. Partin was set in exact accordance with the amounts that Partin owed her for the support of his children on the court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.447" offset="11633142">And finally in this connection, on the matter of compensation of Partin, Grimsley unguardedly states in another connection that some of these trips claimed by the Government as the basis of the payments to Partin to consult with counsel in preparation of his testimony in this proceeding had nothing to do with this proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2975.700" offset="12006170">We would say on the basis of the facts that I have just summarized, on the facts as to compensation that rather clearly Partin was paid by the Government both by way of these checks to his wife and by way of -- to put it at its mildest, easy treatment on the criminal charges that were pending against him, but our basic contention is that this question isn't very material to this case because the fact remains whether he was paid or not that Partin was the Government secret agent before he got to Nashville and remained the Government's hard working and complaisant secret agent throughout the Test Fleet defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.890" offset="12254960">I have taken considerable time, may it please the Court to state these facts at length in detail and in their full color and one of the reasons that I have done so is that the writers of the Government's brief in relation to the facts of this case tend to close their eyes, shut their ears, do something like this and argue this case as if Partin with no prior connection with the Government as a private visitor in petitioner Hoffa's home is entrusted with confidences as to jury tampering and as a good citizen reports them to the Government but that is not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.477" offset="12497272">Here, no matter how minor conflicts in the evidence may be resolved or not resolved at all, the basic set of facts are clear, Partin contracted with Grimsley in Atlanta on October 20th before the opening of the Test Fleet trial to look for jury tampering in Nashville.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.161" offset="12620048">He repeatedly looked for evidence of jury tampering in Nashville.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.999" offset="12639378">He repeatedly looked for such evidence in petitioner Hoffa's home and in the same place petitioner Hoffa's defense headquarters and according to his own testimony he there heard or overheard much of what he was looking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.684" offset="12718059">Now, Partin did not tell petitioners Hoffa or King that he was acting for the Government throughout the Test Fleet trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.732" offset="12762258">As Partin puts it, he did not so tell them, "because if they wasn't violating the law they shouldn't care."</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.108" offset="12811786">This is Partin's view of the protection of the Fourth and Sixth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.150" offset="12839999">Admittedly however, there was so explicit statement in the Government's brief that it is the Government's view too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.455" offset="12877197">Now, petitioner Hoffa did not assume that a private visitor to his home would reveal a confidence as to illegal activity to the Government as a good citizen what Partin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.347" offset="12948773">I'm sorry, what petitioner Hoffa assumed was that there was no policeman in his home unless he appeared at the door with a warrant and announced his police identity and purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.093" offset="13023796">This brings us may it please the Court to our argument on the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.512" offset="13057442">The admissions which Partin claims to have gotten from petitioners Hoffa and King are set forth in detail at pages 14 to 18 of our main brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.606" offset="13137795">So far as the Fourth Amendment is concerned, the following plain facts are important as to these claim admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.860" offset="13178859">First, any single one of them would have been seriously prejudicial to the petitioners, second, some of them who have gotten by Partin in petitioner Hoffa's suite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.434" offset="13249076">These were the objective and direct result of Partin's repeated entries into that suite as a Government secret agent on October 22nd, the opening day of the Test Fleet trial and on that day, two entries, on October 23rd, October 25th, October 26th, October 29th, November 7th, November 14th, two entries, November 15th and November 20th, a total of 11 distinct and separate entries into their home suite in a period of four weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.580" offset="13421693">Third, on all of these entries, Partin as a secret government agent was looking for evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.493" offset="13461295">Fourth, on all of these entries, Partin as the Government secret agent was looking for evidence of nothing more definite that witness intimidation, jury tampering or other illegal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.544" offset="13537573">Fifth, for none of these entries did Partin have a warrant of any sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.353" offset="13564740">And sixth, throughout of course of all of these petitioner Hoffa's home, petitioner Hoffa in that home was preparing his defense of the Test Fleet charges in conjunction with his counsel so that these entries in violation of the Fourth Amendment as we claimed were part of a continuous process of a pervasive intrusion on the Test Fleet defense by the Government through the Sheridan-Partin operation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3688.779" offset="14858533">Because of what?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_a_fanelli" startTime="3689.528" stopTime="4155.537">
            <label>Mr. Joseph A. Fanelli</label>
            <text syncTime="3689.528" offset="14861458">Because of Gouled where there was a fraudulent entry, a deceptive entry by a Government, a secret government agent into this man's office and documents were taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.133" offset="14911927">Only God would know, I suppose, how many and maybe the Government how much it might have taken by way of documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.937" offset="14959156">But I think also pertinent to your question Mr. Justice Harlan, is the fact that the 11 entries that I have enumerated and detailed were the 11 entries that produced the incriminating statements to which he testified but he was there on 33 days, 33 trial days of the Test Fleet case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.332" offset="15056750">He was constantly hanging around in the suite and he was that time in that suite when neither petitioner Hoffa nor petitioner King was there but there was no evidence that at time he took any documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.091" offset="15115786">Now, to get on with where I was in my argument, I had just stated that the Government concedes as we believe it must in accordance with the authority cited at pages 36 and 37 that an entry into a man's home by deception to look for evidence without a warrant is as violative of the Constitution of the Fourth Amendment as such an entry made by force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.183" offset="15232084">And further the Government concedes as it must because of Wong Sun against United States, 371 U.S. 471 that the Fourth Amendment protects not only against documents and other concrete things but against verbal statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.727" offset="15334275">These Government concessions made in accordance with the authorities, it seems to us to dispose of the Fourth Amendment contention in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.282" offset="15376488">Decision here in our favor is controlled by Gouled against the united States in the 255 Volume of this Court's reports at page 98 and Go-Bart and the decision of this Court Go-Bart Importing Company against the United States in the 282nd Volume of the official reports in this Court at page 344 for the only difference of substance between Gouled and Go-Bart on the one hand and this case on the other is that in Gouled and Go-Bart, the deceptive entry obtained incriminating documents and in this case, the Government's deceptive entry obtained incriminating statements and so far as that difference is concerned we say that Wong Sun makes that difference immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3887.854" offset="15654745">But the Government says and now I come to what it is they are really argue Mr. Justice Harlan but the Government says that Gouled and Go-Bart Importing Company would be controlling here if and only if Partin having achieved entry into the Government suite by deception had heard the alleged incriminating statements by eavesdropping.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.473" offset="15793298">Now, it is the fact in this record may it please the Court that several of the alleged incriminating statements were eavesdropped, they were overheard by petition -- by Partin from petitioners Hoffa and King.</text>
            <text syncTime="3942.955" offset="15875218">However, in a further sniffing off of Fourth Amendment protections to tailor that Fourth Amendment so that this case falls outside of it, the Government says further that for Fourth Amendment protection, not only must Partin have been eavesdropping overhearing but in addition he must have been hiding as in a closet or it may be in a toilet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.911" offset="16006980">Analyze says the Government and Your Honors got an information of this in Mr. Lewin's argument in the case preceding this, the statements, the alleged incriminating statements could just as well have been made on the street and so they are outside Fourth Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3999.650" offset="16101961">This is the Government's position and its argument and to state it is almost to answer it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4006.622" offset="16129860">In its major aspects as we all know, the fourth Amendment is precisely directed to the protection of the privacy of particular areas and especially may it please the Court the privacy of a man's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="4025.268" offset="16204466">As Judge Frank put it in his opinion in the Second Circuit in the On Lee case quoted with approval by this Court later, a man's home, "the inviolate place which is a man's castle."</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.755" offset="16278444">The full quotation from Mr. -- from Judge Frank's description of the privacy of a home as a sizable hunk of liberty may it please Court worth protecting from encroachment is set forth at page 33 in the footnote of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4066.228" offset="16368306">The alleged incriminating statements in this case Your Honors were not made in the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="4073.084" offset="16395682">They were made in petitioner Hoffa's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.277" offset="16416475">Partin, the Government's secret agent got into that home by 11 entries in violation of the Sixth Amendment -- of the Fourth Amendment I beg your pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="4094.011" offset="16479378">The statements allegedly obtained by Partin cannot be separated from those illegal entries for they were the very objective of those entries and their immediate product.</text>
            <text syncTime="4108.256" offset="16536430">No amount of finespun the Government theorizing to meet the facts of this case can change or eliminate those simple and immutable facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.015" offset="16591391">Further more may it please the Court, it makes no sense to say that Partin entered petitioner Hoffa's suite by deception in violation of the Fourth Amendment but somehow left that Fourth Amendment lying here by the door when he immediately continued in the same deception in talking with petitioners Hoffa and King.</text>

            <text syncTime="4254.109" offset="17119796">It makes no sense at all may it please the Court to say that the Fourth Amendment protects the householder against a policeman hiding in a closet but not against the policeman who is hiding under his role of helping you in your defense of a criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4283.884" offset="17238915">In both cases above all things the Fourth Amendment protects the privacy of the home be it ever so humble or be it a hotel suite.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.974" offset="17283218">In both cases, no matter where that policeman or how that policeman is hiding, the Government is secretly in the home eavesdropping, listening in on all conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4313.428" offset="17357093">Surely Your Honors in the light of centuries of American and Anglo-Saxon history and remembering Lord Chatham's noble statement that the king's men cannot without warrant enter the cottage of the poorest villager and considering for a moment what it is about the police state that we oppose it throughout the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="4348.196" offset="17496168">We cannot rationally believe that our forefathers in adopting the Fourth Amendment and the members of this Court in applying that amendment for almost 200 years ever contemplated that the Government secret listening in on the home conversations of a free people would ever be permissible under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.764" offset="17622392">In reliance on an invalid eavesdropping theory, the Government sees no differences between this case, the Lopez case, the On Lee case and the Lewis case which follows our case upon the argument calendar.</text>
            <text syncTime="4403.203" offset="17716224">But On Lee unlike this case did not involve an area protected under the Fourth Amendment and Lopez unlike this case did not involve a government secret agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4420.519" offset="17785396">In both Lopez and Lewis the petitioner invited the government agent to his home or office for the very purpose of the transaction that took place, the offer of a bribe in Lopez and the sale of narcotics in Lewis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.189" offset="17880168">Here petitioner did not invite Partin to his suite to bribe them as a juror and influence him as a juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="4458.094" offset="17935757">Partin of course was not a juror or perspective juror and Hoffa in fact made no such offer or attempt to influence in relation to Partin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4473.334" offset="17996675">Petitioner Hoffa did not invite Partin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4477.293" offset="18012557">Partin invited himself by those telephone conversations on October 8th and 18th recorded by the state officials with reporting going to Grimsley and Sheridan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.991" offset="18075355">Partin invited himself and spied on petitioner Hoffa.</text>
            <text syncTime="4498.245" offset="18096358">So far as petitioner permitted Partin in his home suite in the place where he was preparing his defense the permission was solely for the union colleague and defense Hoffa.</text>
            <text syncTime="4517.658" offset="18173994">Unlike On Lee, unlike Lopez, unlike Lewis and unlike any other case presented to this Court under the Fourth Amendment in all its history this case presents particular facts and circumstances strongly called for Fourth Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4543.868" offset="18278797">I enumerate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4545.692" offset="18286111">Here, it is not only that the Government violated the privacy of a citizen's home but that the Government arranged for that violation before there was even a possibility that a crime had been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4565.611" offset="18365837">Here, it is not only that the Government violated the privacy of a citizen's home and arranged for that violation before a crime could possibly ever been committed, but it violated that home privacy not once, not for just one conversation as my colleague was arguing earlier this morning but many times and over a protracted period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4593.666" offset="18478059">And finally in this case, the Government's repeated and protracted violations of the Fourth Amendment were directed against the man on trial for his liberty and preparing his defense in his home so that inevitably these violations of the Fourth Amendment were part of a Government pervasive intrusion on his defense in violation of the Sixth Amendment and that brings us to our Sixth Amendment argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4630.941" offset="18627166">Our contention on the Sixth Amendment concerns the very heart of the Sixth Amendment guarantee, the right of a man on trial for his life or liberty to have the effective assistance of counsel free from any Government intrusion upon that defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4652.751" offset="18714415">The Government at least at some points in this brief agrees with that statement of what the right is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4660.820" offset="18746702">But the Government purports seriously to argue that Partin did not intrude upon the Test Fleet defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4668.730" offset="18778258">It would be a sufficient answer may it please the Court to note that Sheridan admitted that some Test Fleet trial information, defense information was passed on to him and for that to happen there had to be an intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.571" offset="18845654">In any event, without repeating all the details that I stated this morning the intrusion can be summed up follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="4694.969" offset="18883271">Partin carrying out his government job of looking for evidence of jury tampering naturally sought that evidence in the counsels of the Test Fleet defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4708.891" offset="18938964">Partin's ostensible purpose of discussing his personal affairs with petitioner Hoffa in Nashville on October 22nd wouldn't serve as a cover for petitioner Hoffa staying Nashville for the purpose of looking for evidence of illegal jury tampering.</text>
            <text syncTime="4733.913" offset="19039065">Some better cover was needed so Partin became a defense helper, this would keep him in and around petitioner Hoffa and his counsel throughout the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4745.140" offset="19083891">As a defense helper, Partin was in the midst of defense preparations, consultations and talks everywhere in petitioner Hoffa's suite, defense headquarters, at the courthouse, at meals and going to and from the courthouses and meal and Partin state in the midst of the Test Fleet's defense throughout the Test Fleet trial and he did so with the Government's continuing approval for he reported to Sheridan daily and he did so to the Government's continuing profit for besides the admissions of jury tampering the Government obtained and used Test Fleet defense information.</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.271" offset="19304469">Thus the Government in obvious disregard of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel perpetrated not just an intrusion but a pervasive infiltration of that defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4813.633" offset="19357863">With the Government's violation of the Sixth Amendment apparent, the aspect of the Sixth Amendment question left is whether the incriminating statements were tainted by that Sixth Amendment violation, if so all parties are aggrieved that they were in admissible in the trial below and aggrieved in accordance with the authority stated in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4839.200" offset="19460159">Partin admits that counsel was sometimes close but not in on the conversations in which he heard or overhead the incriminating statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4851.766" offset="19510418">The admission serves to emphasize the fact of a single line of action by one man Partin designed to secure evidence of jury tampering by Partin's acting as a defense assistant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4868.450" offset="19577187">A Sixth Amendment violation deliberately risked by Sheridan as the Government admits in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4876.439" offset="19609161">The primary product of that violation was the very objective sought by that violation, Partin's evidence of jury tampering.</text>
            <text syncTime="4887.775" offset="19654510">The bonus was Test Fleet defense information, both primary product and bonus were obtained by one man in one continuous process carried on in the same places over the same period of time and reported daily to Sheridan in the same reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.708" offset="19738206">To separate product and bonus in these circumstances would be to treat the Sixth Amendment as a thing of water, a faucet to be turned on and off as Partin moved from one part of defense headquarters to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="4927.519" offset="19813439">In any event, as follows a fortiori from comparable cases decided by this Court, we cite them in our brief at page 48, footnote 2, the primary objective and the very product of a Sixth Amendment violation of any constitutional violation cannot be separated from that violation for in those circumstances, we have much more than the take which connects for an indirect connection evidence with a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.952" offset="19975189">I turn to our argument on due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4970.810" offset="19986578">To the question of whether petitioners were afforded the essential fairness required by the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4979.103" offset="20019806">A secret informer may it please the Court seems an unlovely thing to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="4986.742" offset="20050317">Yet we recognize that there are constitutional uses of government informers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4993.925" offset="20079052">We rely on much more than the evil of a secret government informer in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5000.849" offset="20106742">The use of a Government informer, a secret informer always risks perjury but that risk was at its highest here in view of the charges pending against Partin and in view of his natural desire to justify the payments to his wife no matter for what those payments were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5023.070" offset="20195662">As (Inaudible) teaches, Your Honors decision in that case, the risk of perjury in a government secret informer's testimony may be so great as in and of itself to invalidate a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.397" offset="20260968">But there was more here than the strong risk of perjury to condemn the convictions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5047.536" offset="20293465">The Government unquestionably ignored Sixth Amendment rights in relation to the Test Fleet defense unquestionably in our opinion on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5059.416" offset="20341008">But putting aside our other legal protections, the Government's conduct was at a minimum within the penumbra of practically every Fourth Amendment guarantee of Sixth Amendment rights to counsel in this proceeding, of Fifth Amendment rights to self incrimination in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5082.703" offset="20434213">Whatever the legal consequences of the Government's action separately considered under each amendment may be, the Government did invade the privacy of the man's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="5094.877" offset="20482905">Did infiltrate the counsels of this defense and did deprive him of the opportunity to consult counsel and to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.858" offset="20526791">Finally, as the Government does not contest it had probable cause for arrest and charge on -- and charge on jury tampering on October 25th.</text>
            <text syncTime="5118.795" offset="20578513">On that day, legitimate law enforcement call for arrest and charge with a fair trial to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="5127.212" offset="20612263">By deferring arrest and charge, and the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights attended upon such arrest and charge as recently explicated by this Court in this term, the Government effectively nullified those rights secured many more incriminating admissions and rendered petitioner's trial a near formality.</text>
            <text syncTime="5154.231" offset="20720306">That is the whole of the Government's conduct which we say is offensive to due process case up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5161.543" offset="20749563">In conclusion on the whole case we observe that the Government offers extraneous reasons to explain its conduct in this case but we stand here on the requirements of the Constitution as the court observed in United States against (Inaudible), the Constitution is designed to place obstacles in the way of a two permeating police surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5187.890" offset="20854888">Partin surveillance in behalf of the Government in this case was so permeating as to short circuit the productive protective power of practically every constitutional safeguard on the enforcement of the criminal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="5205.731" offset="20926255">We respectfully submit that on the well settled principles of constitutional law, the facts here show that the statements were inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5219.325" offset="20980694">All petitioners were prejudiced by those statements which the jury was permitted to consider against all of them as one organic tissue of proof following denial of their motions to severance.</text>

            <text syncTime="5248.560" offset="21097618">Mr. Attorney General, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5252.099" offset="21111724">This case involves the constitutional propriety of conviction of four petitioners charged with violating the obstruction of justice statute by jury tampering.</text>
            <text syncTime="5268.007" offset="21175359">The jury tampering activities disclosed by the record occurred at a trial at which defendant Hoffa was the only defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5280.746" offset="21226350">This case and others set immediately preceding and immediately following have very broad implications bearing upon the use by law enforcement of an investigative technique, law enforcements has always found to be important at the use of informants.</text>
            <text syncTime="5303.430" offset="21317047">Before summarizing the facts, I would call your attention to the limited order of the court in granting certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="5313.975" offset="21359261">In doing this of course, the court acted in accordance with its practice and phrased the question as presented by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5325.746" offset="21406386">There the question referred to the Government's deceptively placing a secret informer with defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5334.772" offset="21442435">The Government's position amply borne out in the record and by the court's findings is simply that it did not place the informant anywhere deceptively or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="5350.616" offset="21505860">I would also at this point like to clear up several matters that counsel referred to concessions made by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5360.394" offset="21544939">The Government does not concede that even if the facts proved as the question is posed were true that petitioners would prevail in this cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5373.525" offset="21597497">Secondly, in response to questions from Justices Harlan and Stewart earlier this morning, counsel for petitioners seems to state that the Government had conceded that there had been an illegal entry in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5394.218" offset="21680253">There has been no such concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="5397.254" offset="21692374">In addition, on page 9 of petitioner's reply brief, there's another concession improperly made or improperly attributed to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5413.396" offset="21756949">The reply brief says that the Government explicitly admits that the Sixth Amendment is violated by the Government's very presence in the protected counsels of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="5427.366" offset="21812851">The Government makes no such concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="5432.123" offset="21831868">The facts --</text>

            <label>Mr. Fred M. Vinson, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="5434.786" offset="21842526">We think the facts indicate the contrary and we do argue the legal point of the contrary, yes Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5444.382" offset="21880874">The facts in the case can best be understood when they are broken down into two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5451.573" offset="21909713">The occurrences which preceded the Nashville trial, that's the trial at the Test Fleet case where the jury tampering took place and secondly the occurrences during that trial which led to the charges in the Chattanooga case which is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5472.822" offset="21994663">Now, you've heard many inferences drawn by able counsel for the petitioner with respect to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5482.880" offset="22034892">I think in connection with the facts it would be helpful to start off on page 58 of the Government's brief with the trial court's findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5494.466" offset="22081285">Now, these were findings that the conclusion of the initial hearing on the motion to suppress Partin's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="5503.792" offset="22118588">The Court said that it is of the opinion that the motion to suppress should be overruled having observed the manner and demeanor of the witness on the witness stand and the testimony of the witnesses, I would find that there has been interference with the Government with any attorney-client relationship of any defendant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5525.516" offset="22205419">I would further find that the Government did not place this witness Mr. Partin in the defendant's midst or have anything to do with placing him in their midst rather that he was knowingly and voluntarily placed in their midst by one of the defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="5551.191" offset="22308133">He did not Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5553.040" offset="22315551">However, he amplified these findings in denying motions for a new trial when the whole panoply of evidence was in.</text>
            <text syncTime="5564.803" offset="22362572">He felt necessary to do this in light of the petitioner's contentions that evidence subsequently introduced, introduced after the motion to suppress affected these findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5576.459" offset="22409174">Now, in answer to this, the trial judge stated that the additional evidence in no way altered the Court's finding that the Government did not place or keep Partin with the defendant Hoffa nor does it relate to or alter the Court's finding that there was no illegal interference with defendant Hoffa's right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5597.350" offset="22492766">Now, in this memorandum, the denial of the new trial where the previous findings were amplified, a court further found one, that Partin remained in Nashville or returned to Nashville either at the request of or with the consent of defendant Hoffa and not at the instruction of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5618.326" offset="22576671">Secondly, that the Government requested of Partin only that he report information of jury tampering or other illegal activity of which he became aware.</text>
            <text syncTime="5629.300" offset="22620557">And third that Partin furnished such information.</text>
            <text syncTime="5634.458" offset="22641246">Now, these findings are amply supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5638.724" offset="22658278">But finally the court held that the presence of Partin during the course of the Nashville trial, the Test Fleet trial and the reporting of information by him at that time did not in any way relate to the rights of the defendants, the petitioners here In the preparation and trial of the Chattanooga case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5661.988" offset="22751274">Now, in the face of these findings I don't think the inferences that either counsel for the petitioner or counsel for the Government to draw or particularly important.</text>
            <text syncTime="5673.906" offset="22799026">However, in view of the due process argument I think its incumbent on the Government to respond to -- certain of the inferences drawn to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5691.120" offset="22867884">Now, in 1962 the time of the National Test Fleet trial, Edward Partin as we've heard was an official of Local No. 5 of the Teamsters Union in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="5705.726" offset="22926294">Since 1957 he had been a close associate of petitioner Hoffa.</text>
            <text syncTime="5713.373" offset="22956910">It's true that in late September 1962 Partin was in a state jail in Louisiana on a kidnapping charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5723.135" offset="22995884">This charge arose from a family dispute in which Partin assisted his best friend, a father in taking his children away from his estranged wife and kidnapping in Louisiana is an unbailable offense until the victim is returned unharmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5744.323" offset="23080626">At that time, the children had not been returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5747.958" offset="23095254">At the same time Partin was on bail on a federal charge, a violation of labor management purporting in disclosure act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5757.487" offset="23133288">Now, still in late September, Partin met twice with state prosecutors on successive days.</text>
            <text syncTime="5766.616" offset="23169860">At these meetings as counsel has stated, he related to these state officials an alleged plan by petitioner Hoffa to murder Robert Kennedy who was then Attorney General of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5783.370" offset="23236838">The local officials reported this matter to the FBI and at their suggestion he reported on to an Assistant United States Attorney in New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="5795.803" offset="23286575">The assistant then called Frank Grimsley whom you've already heard, a Department of Justice attorney who in turn called Walter Sheridan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5806.594" offset="23329729">Now, the substance of these calls was and this is the first contact of the federal establishment with this man and this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="5815.676" offset="23366092">The substance of these calls was that Partin wished to speak to a representative of the department about a gray matter involving security.</text>
            <text syncTime="5827.121" offset="23411858">Now there resulted two meetings to between Partin and two state officials and two federal officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="5835.370" offset="23444877">At the first of these on October 2 or October 3, the record is not clear, Partin repeated his allegation about this alleged plan to murder the attorney general.</text>
            <text syncTime="5849.870" offset="23502869">The testimony is that if Hoffa's impending national trial was mentioned at all, it was by way of a casual remark.</text>
            <text syncTime="5858.200" offset="23536201">Several days later, a second meeting took place between the same people except for one state official who was missing and it was not clear what was discussed at this meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5868.519" offset="23577475">The record is silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5872.146" offset="23591999">The Assistant United States Attorney who was present however testified that he -- as to this meeting he couldn't recall whether Hoffa's name came up at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5881.656" offset="23630033">It's also not clear whether Partin was in jail at this time because by then the children had been returned to their mother and the offense then became bailable.</text>

            <text syncTime="5940.505" offset="23865344">Now, in the meantime, it's now been several days since news of -- was given to the federal establishment about an alleged murder attempt or plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5955.028" offset="23923440">The FBI was conducting an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5960.547" offset="23945592">This investigation included examinations of Partin by polygraph and the polygraph expert concluded that the test lent support to Partin's allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5976.672" offset="24010062">Now, at about this same point in time, one difficulty with the facts here as if we have a months period of time when there is a whole lot churning and a lot of happening and a lot separate interests coalescing but about this same point in time October 6, Partin's federal bond was cancelled by a bonding company.</text>
            <text syncTime="5997.691" offset="24094177">This was a $50,000.00 bond and Partin had to go to local friends to help him put up a new bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="6005.949" offset="24127195">Now, the bonding company which canceled was a business interest of Allen Dorfman who was a close associate and friend of petitioner Hoffa's and later he was a codefendant in the Chattanooga trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6023.349" offset="24196786">He was acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6024.979" offset="24203264">Now, Hoffa had helped get this bond from Dorfman so Partin suspected that petitioner Hoffa may have had something to do with the cancellation and he wanted to talk to him about it and find out really if and why.</text>
            <text syncTime="6042.629" offset="24273899">Now, also about this time around October 6, 1962, a state official and Partin moved into a motel in Baton Rouge.</text>
            <text syncTime="6054.879" offset="24322905">This -- there was some testimony to the effect that this was for the purpose of corroborating information that Partin had been reporting to him, the state official, the state district attorney since late September and in this connection for this purpose the state district attorney testified that he instructed Partin in the use of a recording device and that Partin recorded between 80 and a hundred telephone calls in this four day period and in a subsequent three day period now only two of these recorded calls were with petitioner Hoffa.</text>
            <text syncTime="6095.302" offset="24484551">And the defense introduced the transcripts of those calls into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6101.857" offset="24510777">Now, this recording equipment of course belonged to the state and the state officer was acting in his capacity as a state officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="7411.704" offset="29750209">Now during the remaining 22 days approximately that Partin was in Nashville during the trial both petitioners Hoffa and petitioner King made a number of statements relating to jury tampering, incriminating statements to Partin.</text>
            <text syncTime="7432.538" offset="29833488">Or Hoffa berated petitioner King in -- about his inefficiency in this jury tampering efforts and this was in Hoffa's -- this was in Partin's presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="7448.426" offset="29897122">Counsel for petitioners made much of the fact in his Fourth Amendment argument that this was a different sort of overhearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="7459.341" offset="29940694">This wasn't a face to face conversation which the auditor was intended to hear but the record in this regard makes clear that Partin was on the scene, was known to be on the scene and was intended that he overhear this conversation so that no real distinction in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="7483.540" offset="30037556">The statements that were told to Partin or that were made in his known presence included one that petitioner Hoffa made with respect to having the male Negro juror in his hip pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="7501.745" offset="30110386">These statements as to jury tampering were all passed on to Mr. Sheridan by Partin either personally or by phone.</text>
            <text syncTime="7512.456" offset="30153226">With respect to the statement as to this particular Juror Fields was the only male Negro on the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="7526.099" offset="30207770">Now, there's no dispute that Partin call Sheridan or met with him often perhaps daily when in Nashville during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="7537.989" offset="30255313">These reports were all oral.</text>
            <text syncTime="7542.439" offset="30273076">Mr. Sheridan received Partin's reports without comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="7546.705" offset="30290213">He never gave Partin instructions as to what to do or not to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="7551.121" offset="30307871">He didn't ask him to stay in Nashville.</text>
            <text syncTime="7555.081" offset="30323649">Now, when information as to the jury tampering was received by Sheridan, he would turn it over to the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="7563.874" offset="30358862">The FBI would then investigate and seek to corroborate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7569.262" offset="30380387">When the investigation eventually or eventuated into a great substance corroboration of the Partin reports, remedial steps were taken by advising the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7584.763" offset="30442454">This led in December of the trial first to the disqualification of Juror Pascual and then to the disqualification of Juror Fields.</text>
            <text syncTime="7598.221" offset="30496266">We've already discussed the matter of payment and the confusion about payment in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="7608.572" offset="30537644">The record that probably is the most contradictory with respect to Partin's access to the quarters and counsels of the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="7623.459" offset="30597204">Petitioner Hoffa had five attorneys of record during the trial and three other attorneys were with him during part or all of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="7635.689" offset="30646105">I have already alluded to the throngs of non-lawyers who were passing through and in and out of these premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="7645.155" offset="30684035">Partin testified that he was in and around petitioner Hoffa's suite and for a period of time, he did act as doorman.</text>
            <text syncTime="7654.240" offset="30720293">He also testified that he frequently saw and occasionally conferred with petitioner Hoffa's attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="7662.265" offset="30752475">In essence, his testimony was that he made no effort to be present at conversations involving attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="7669.658" offset="30782046">He might have been but he did not know what they were talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="7672.422" offset="30793017">He's a man with a tenth grade education.</text>
            <text syncTime="7676.184" offset="30808064">He stated that the attorneys would move you out as he expressed it when they were discussing the case and he didn't think that he ever reported anything told him by an attorney because Sheridan wasn't interested in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7690.215" offset="30864280">Now, Sheridan's testimony with one exception is not to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="7696.356" offset="30888835">Sheridan testified that Partin passed on to him information as to the comings and goings of people, jury tampering efforts, happenings that were perhaps illegal, certainly unethical and a very few comments generally related to the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="7715.320" offset="30964694">At no time did Sheridan receive any documents or any copies of documents from Partin.</text>
            <text syncTime="7723.783" offset="30998549">Now, I refer to one exception, the counsel referred to as this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="7728.722" offset="31018297">This was -- this exception concern an oral report by Partin that Sheridan understood to mean a lawyer was writing out questions and answers for a group of witnesses to memorize.</text>
            <text syncTime="7742.960" offset="31075244">Partin did not convey to Sheridan the questions and answers themselves but merely the fact that there were questions and answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="7754.021" offset="31119444">Now, the defense testimony which in regard to access, you heard summarized in part this morning, it contains a number of internal inconsistencies as to the degree of Partin's presence and his participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7776.481" offset="31209305">But actually petitioner Hoffa's own testimony which is found at Volume IV of the record at page 1396 gives the impression that I could characterize a testimony as giving the impression that he saw Partin very little during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="7802.187" offset="31312123">He was busy and he didn't find time to sit down with him to talk about the union business until late in the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="7877.131" offset="31611904">This apprehension proved to be fully justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="7882.200" offset="31632175">Now, on the first morning of the trial at about or just before Mr. Partin arrived, a prospective juror reported to the court an improper phone call from someone posing as a newspaper reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="7901.151" offset="31707930">Two more such calls were received -- well, two more of such reports from jurors were made the following day.</text>

            <text syncTime="7910.643" offset="31745964">October 22nd was the first report, first day of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="7916.951" offset="31771146">Partin's report of course on the afternoon or evening of October 22nd when he had just arrived in town confirmed these fears and on October 24, this is the third day of trial and it was before the jury was actually sworn, James Tippens who had been tentatively ceded as a juror on the preceding day reported to the court that a neighbor had offered him $10,000 in $100 bills in connection with his prospective service at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="7954.006" offset="31919417">Now, the court advised petitioner Hoffa and counsel for both sides in the Nashville trial of this report and excused Tippens from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="7967.117" offset="31971871">Mr. Partin testified that when he returned to Nashville on the 25th that petitioner Hoffa related this instant to him and commented that we're going to have to lie low a few days.</text>
            <text syncTime="7983.107" offset="32035819">So at this very early stage in the proceeding it was quite apparent to the Government that a large scale attack on the integrity of this jury in this trial was well under way.</text>
            <text syncTime="7998.241" offset="32096319">The activities of this nature ultimately culminated with 12 defendants charge with nine separate endeavors to obstruct and in six persons convicted, four of which -- four of these convictions are before the court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8019.850" offset="32182732">And of course the case immediately preceding this, the Osborne cases involved a similar charge in the succeeding Chattanooga case.</text>

            <text syncTime="8055.035" offset="32323480">Now, I should make clear that the Government's position and the Government's basic arguments don't depend on the practical necessities of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8068.086" offset="32375724">This is what the Government was confronted with and had to deal with from the first day of the trial but our basic arguments don't depend on those practical necessities.</text>
            <text syncTime="8078.701" offset="32418147">But we do ask the court to consider these exigencies in connection with the basic question of fairness presented.</text>

            <text syncTime="8106.634" offset="32529951">If we should conclude that Partin was a paid representative of the Government for the purpose of getting into the counsels of the defense, would your position be the same?</text>

            <text syncTime="8126.501" offset="32609364">Our legal position would be the same, yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="8134.383" offset="32640920">Now, the legal issue upon which certiorari has been granted concerns the admissibility in Chattanooga of the evidence obtained by the Government from Partin during the Nashville Test Fleet case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8152.577" offset="32713644">More precisely the issues whether Partin's testimony with respect to jury tampering efforts should have been excluded at the Chattanooga trial as having been obtained in violation of the Fourth, Fifth or Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="8167.723" offset="32774248">Now, the context however for determining this question is the Chattanooga jury fixing case and not the Nashville Test Fleet case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8178.885" offset="32818866">It's very important at the outset of the Sixth Amendment argument to note that Partin's challenged testimony dealt with statements made to him by petitioners Hoffa and King concerning current or future endeavors to corrupt the Nashville jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="8200.351" offset="32904756">The Sixth Amendment certainly does not make privilege every statement made by defendant on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="8208.334" offset="32936730">It does not cloak with privilege statements made concerning criminal offenses which are planned or committed during trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="8218.304" offset="32976541">If a defendant tells his lawyer that he's going to bribe a juror, the attorney has an obligation to attempt to dissuade his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="8228.662" offset="33018023">He also has an obligation to report the plan of felony to the authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="8235.664" offset="33046026">The law is clear in this area, the Clark case dicta in the Supreme Court, in In Re Sawyer, Seventh Circuit case and many others.</text>
            <text syncTime="8247.210" offset="33092211">Now, an informant is as least -- an informant is at least as free to report and testify to such disclosures as the attorney of the person who makes the disclosures.</text>
            <text syncTime="8266.943" offset="33171101">Thus, we feel that the short answer to the Sixth Amendment issue is that petitioner Hoffa and petitioner King's remarks as to which Partin testified were clearly unprivileged.</text>
            <text syncTime="8281.725" offset="33230242">Now, with further reference and still on the Sixth Amendment point it's important to note that the issue in the case is still not the constitutional standards relating to the Nashville trial but the admissibility of evidence at the Chattanooga trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="8304.835" offset="33322715">Now, both the trial court and the Court of Appeals held that there was no interference with Sixth Amendment rights at the Chattanooga trial, the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="8320.683" offset="33386141">They reasoned and we argue that it's not necessary any fruit of the poisoned tree argument because there just was no unlawful invasion by the Government of defendant's right to counsel in the Nashville Test Fleet case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8339.153" offset="33460015">But in any event as I will develop more fully in a moment, the Partin's testimony was not in any sense the fruit of alleged governmental wrongdoing.</text>

            <text syncTime="8556.836" offset="34330728">However, I would not consider the reporting of a statement made as to ongoing criminality to be in any way connected with the Sixth Amendment rights involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="8575.773" offset="34406484">The question you posed with respect to obstruction of justice on one hand and the Sixth Amendment violation on the other hand really illustrates the -- one of the ironies in this case because here in our view the petitioners seek to expand the umbrella of the Sixth Amendment which passes a very basic purpose, the protection of the adversary system and at the same time it's charged with violations of Section 1503, the statute which has the same general purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="8616.255" offset="34568443">But getting back to the fruit argument, I believe that in this Court the petitioners have changed the thrust of their argument a bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="8627.465" offset="34613269">Below, they argued the fruit of the wrongdoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="8633.231" offset="34636257">Here they appear to take the position that it's not a fruit problem but rather this is the poisoned tree itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="8642.247" offset="34672410">But in order to examine this issue in either context.</text>
            <text syncTime="8648.385" offset="34696861">We first should recall that the issue is the admissibility of evidence in the Chattanooga trial, the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="8659.058" offset="34739597">Now, the alleged wrongdoing is intrusion by the Government upon the right of counsel and defendant's right and counsel's right to prepare for trial, right -- rights which are protected by the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="8677.672" offset="34814098">With regard to the Chattanooga trial, the question is whether any alleged infringement of petitioner's rights in Nashville requires the exclusion of Partin's testimony as to jury tampering efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="8699.258" offset="34900407">The test set up by this Court in Wong Sun, the test for determining causal connection is helpful in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="8710.982" offset="34947323">The court said that the question is whether granting primary illegality the evidence has been come at by exploitation of that illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="8724.447" offset="35001135">Now, for applying this test, we must assume arguendo that there was a violation of Sixth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="8732.553" offset="35033631">It's this violation the alleged communication of defense strategy which we feel would constitute the primary illegality under the Wong Sun test.</text>
            <text syncTime="8746.506" offset="35089429">The unprivileged statements regarding jury tampering and thus Partin's testimony was not -- come at in any sense of the word by exploitation of that illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="8761.918" offset="35151078">Now, here Partin did not obtain evidence with respect to jury tampering as a consequence of any knowledge that he gained during the course of attorneys' conferences or otherwise related to the operation of the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="8778.917" offset="35218996">Here no statement petitioner Hoffa's, no statement of petitioner King's which was testified to by Partin had any possible relationship to any legitimate aspect of the Nashville defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="8802.486" offset="35313351">How do we know what the Government knew as a result of Parin's disclosures to it and how do we know what it -- what might have helped them promote disclosures in a strategy in their case?</text>
            <text syncTime="8820.295" offset="35384508">It isn't just a fact that they introduced testimony concerning statements but how can the court know if you have someone from the other side sitting in on your counsels?</text>

            <text syncTime="8832.621" offset="35433827">Well, that question of course -- that question is -- would be -- if we were here talking about the constitutional propriety of the Nashville trial as to whether the defendant -- the defendant's secret information had been fed to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="8855.480" offset="35525256">If that were the fact, I would agree that the Nashville trial would fall short of constitutional standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="8864.239" offset="35560364">But here, we are talking about the Chattanooga trial months hence at which Partin testified to the jury tampering efforts during the Nashville trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="8880.504" offset="35625357">The -- another approach to the Sixth Amendment problem is of course to say that this is analogous to the argument we've previously made as to say that the Sixth Amendment defines a relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="8899.654" offset="35701948">It doesn't define the defense camp as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="8903.495" offset="35717308">It's the relationship between the attorney and his client, their right to prepare for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="8914.956" offset="35763179">Now, heartening back to Wong Sun, the Court held that Wong Sun's confession made after his illegal arrest was not the fruit of the Government's wrongdoing because following his release, he returned voluntarily several days later to make his statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="8938.353" offset="35856802">Now, the Court's holding was that the causal connection between the arrest and the statement was so attenuated that the taint was dissipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="8951.465" offset="35909256">There was a connection where it was tenuous.</text>
            <text syncTime="8955.207" offset="35924198">In this case, we urge that the relationship between whatever access Partin had to defense strategy in the Nashville case and the incriminating statements privately made to him is far more tenuous there completely unrelated to any testimony of Partin in Chattanooga bears no relationship to any legitimate aspect of the defense of the Nashville trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="8992.380" offset="36072887">The main thrust of petitioner's argument in this Court would appear to be the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="9002.375" offset="36112906">In Osborne argued immediately preceding these cases, the Fourth Amendment was adverted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="9012.220" offset="36152299">In Lewis, the case immediately following the Fourth Amendment is virtually the only issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="9021.847" offset="36190751">As the Fourth Amendment issues in this case, in Lewis particularly are so closely allied, I will limit my argument with respect to the Fourth Amendment to -- a response to petitioner's principal contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="9040.103" offset="36263790">But before doing this, I think it would help to focus on this problem to set forth clearly those matters about which there is no dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="9053.511" offset="36317393">We have no dispute with Gouled.</text>
            <text syncTime="9055.239" offset="36324289">We have no dispute with any of the cases cited by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="9062.531" offset="36353546">These are the matters which are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="9064.975" offset="36363264">There is no dispute that the hotel suite occupied by the petitioner was an area protected by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="9073.293" offset="36396596">There's no dispute that the Fourth Amendment can under some circumstances be violated not only by a forceful invasion but by stealthy or deceptive entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="9088.684" offset="36458141">We point out in our brief however on pages 133 and 134 that the conduct of Partin did not amount to the type of deceptive invasion prohibited by the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="9103.322" offset="36516655">Petitioner Hoffa knew Partin's identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="9106.527" offset="36529507">He knew that he posses the legal right to exclude him and he knew that he didn't have to speak to him anytime, anyplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="9116.199" offset="36568168">Now, petitioner's brief is at pangs to establish that verbal statements can be the subject of a Fourth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="9128.920" offset="36619055">We do not disagree but petitioner goes on to state that every statement, every statement made within the confines of a protected area is constitutionally protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="9144.039" offset="36679555">And here, we sharply disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="9149.426" offset="36701080">The statements made by petitioners Hoffa or petitioners King were not made in reliance on the fact that the parties were at that time in the hotel suite of Hoffa.</text>
            <text syncTime="9166.265" offset="36768475">The statements bore no relationship to the privacy of that suite.</text>
            <text syncTime="9173.076" offset="36795643">They could have been made on the street, an open field, in a hotel lobby.</text>
            <text syncTime="9182.403" offset="36832946">In fact, some of the statements, two pages in petitioner's brief is devoted to setting forth these statements as obvious that many other made more elsewhere which again just demonstrates the irrelevancy of the place where statements of this nature and quality are made.</text>

            <text syncTime="9333.875" offset="37438882">Now, prior decisions upon which petitioner appears to rely aren't inconsistent really with our analysis of the protection which lies behind the Fourth Amendment, the Silverman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="9354.894" offset="37522996">Government agents there eavesdropped by means of penetration into a protected area.</text>
            <text syncTime="9365.243" offset="37564374">That issue just isn't present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="9368.315" offset="37576600">In Gouled relied on most forcefully by petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="9374.258" offset="37600423">A government agent pretended to make a friendly call, gained entrance in that deceptive manner and then when the owner of the premises was absent surreptitiously took documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="9389.181" offset="37660087">In this case, in the context of the cases before the court here, this would be analogous to as hiding in the closet and overhearing statements which were not intended for that auditor to hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="9411.775" offset="37750471">Now, the facts of this case resemble in some ways those in Lopez v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="9423.317" offset="37796655">There, an Internal Revenue agent pretended deceptively to collaborate in defendant's efforts to bribe him.</text>
            <text syncTime="9434.086" offset="37839705">The court held that there was no unlawful invasion of defendant's office because of this, the deception and pointed out that he did not violate the privacy of the office by seizing something surreptitiously without petitioner's knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="9455.937" offset="37927163">Now, I would point out that even those who dissented in Lopez did not do so on the basis that a Fourth Amendment violation had occurred because the Government agent had not disclosed his real intentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="9473.145" offset="37995917">In fact the language of the dissenters supports the Government's position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="9480.592" offset="38025697">The language I referred to is that which relates to it is not an undue risk to ask persons to assume for it does no more than compel them to use discretion in choosing their auditors and to make damaging disclosures only to persons whose character and motives may be trusted.</text>
            <text syncTime="9509.333" offset="38140740">There is a final important point which was emphasized in the Government's brief in Lewis.</text>
            <text syncTime="9519.348" offset="38180760">It's equally applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="9522.759" offset="38194448">The Fourth Amendment rule contended for by petitioner would very seriously hamper the Government's use of informants as I have pointed out there is no logical connection between the privacy of a Fourth Amendment area and the fact that a person engaged in committing a crime intentionally makes statements to an informer.</text>
            <text syncTime="9557.751" offset="38334360">Now, acceptance of petitioner's Fourth Amendment argument would mean that the Government would be completely barred from using the testimony of an informer where it relates to statements made by an accused to the informer inside the accuser's house, his apartment, his office, his automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="9583.508" offset="38437386">For all practical purposes, the effective use of informers would be seriously curtailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="9602.755" offset="38514395">With respect to the general subject before the court, the use of informants, there is unfortunately crept into our society the tendency to deprecate private citizens who assist law enforcement agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="9625.322" offset="38604675">Whether that assistance be a physical or testimonial and this of course is true in Spades for the informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="9634.355" offset="38640828">But as our society becomes increasingly complex and sophisticated, so does the rapacity of those who would corrupt society.</text>
            <text syncTime="9649.234" offset="38700283">Now, continuing criminal schemes such as those involving espionage or the deprivation of civil rights has as an important part of its code, the code of silence, penetration by informants is virtually essential in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="9674.337" offset="38800697">Now, any criminal scheme which is well bank-rolled and well-planned provides a very substantial amount of insulation to the top layers.</text>
            <text syncTime="9687.219" offset="38852211">Now, this is particularly true when we deal with consensual crimes, crimes such as gambling, narcotics, bribery, jury tampering.</text>
            <text syncTime="9700.296" offset="38904560">Now, unlike crimes of violence, these consensual crimes do not have individual victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="9710.361" offset="38944789">The only victim of this sort of crime is the body politic.</text>
            <text syncTime="9715.694" offset="38966105">You don't find a successful jury fixer nor do you find a juryman who sold his vote coming into complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="9728.464" offset="39017200">This sort of crime, consensual crime, victimless crime if you will is not just difficult to prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="9737.237" offset="39052309">It's often difficult to discover.</text>
            <text syncTime="9741.167" offset="39068087">Unfortunately, these victimless crimes are those which I feel most perniciously corrode our society.</text>

            <text syncTime="9777.938" offset="39215104">I would just like to take these ten minutes if I may to clarify some of the issues which have been raised and discussed during the Justices' questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="9791.472" offset="39269230">Particularly going to the Chief Justice's question relating to the Sixth Amendment, I think that the critical point in this case, and the point on which the Government stands is that there is no evidence whatever in the record or any shred of suspicion that there was any attempt by the Government in any way to place an informant in the counsels of the defense to learn defense strategy.</text>
            <text syncTime="9818.669" offset="39378004">I believe the Chief Justice asked whether if the Government had in fact had a paid government agent to learn defense secrets whether we would be contending that the testimony of such an agent would be admissible in the trial of these petitioners in Chattanooga.</text>
            <text syncTime="9843.820" offset="39478627">In effect, I think although it might possibly be arguable that we could separate out the testimony of the informant, we think that would be a far, far harder and more difficult case and present much more serious dangers of infringement of constitutional liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="9859.367" offset="39540799">Certainly, the Government may not plant an informant in the counsels of the defense such as the Chief Justice analogized it to a defendant planting an informant in the counsels of the Government to learn strategy.</text>

            <text syncTime="9917.311" offset="39772662">The Government not having any interest at all in learning trial strategy nonetheless knows that jury tampering occurs during a trial and its only during a trial that a defendant, that a man or primarily during a trial that a man discusses attempts to bribe a juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="9932.723" offset="39834311">Now, in this case because of all the background prior to the Nashville trial, there was reason for the Government to believe that there may be other unlawful activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="10599.691" offset="42502144">Now, and this has been held in Conley v. Cochran and other decisions of this Court cited at page 35 and settled may it please the Court since Go-Bart Importing Company when the police came to this house, came on the porch and said we have a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="10619.139" offset="42579884">They at least, you knew they were police and they said they had no -- they had a warrant which they didn't have and in an opinion by Mr. Justice Butler that used to sit upon this bench held that because of that deception, because of a general search for evidence, because of the absence of a warrant as is exactly true in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="10641.833" offset="42670686">Now, as to a couple of little things in respect to one question I think it was Mr. Justice Black's as to the payments to Partin, the memo from Sheridan in the Department of Justice to the late Mr. Andrada ordering these payments said in connection with the forthcoming trials in Nashville, Tennessee it is requested that a check in the amount of $300 be drawn against the confidential fund beginning June -- July 8 and this is dated July 3, 1963 and it is also requested that a check be drawn each month from November 1963 make payable to Mr. Grimsley, not a word about his expenses on these trips nor any substantiation of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="10693.798" offset="42878516">Now, as to a question I believe it was Mr. Justice Black or it might have been the Chief Justice, I forget in my weariness, whether Partin invited himself to see Mr. Hoffa in Nashville or whether Mr. Hoffa invited Partin there was a somewhat uncertain answer by Government counsel but I would refer the Court to pages 1434 and 1438 which set forth those 12 telephone conversations and there was absolutely no question that Mr. Partin invited himself to Nashville.</text>

            <text syncTime="10756.376" offset="43128874">Thank you very much Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="10758.975" offset="43139323">Government counsel made a reference to as our society -- to something about as our society gets more and more complicated, criminal activities become more and more sophisticated might have been the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="10775.138" offset="43203897">I thought he was talking about the Department of Justice and I mean that and not jokingly until he referred to espionage and then I know that well that couldn't be the Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="10786.812" offset="43250604">But in this type of issue on the questions and constitutional issues presented here, this Court has always found that more pertinent to observe that as its decisions have caught up with this unconstitutional police invasion of the Constitution and that one hardly anybody maybe gets the fair degree today the methods of the police in invading constitutional requirements become more and more sophisticated and therefore as has been said by this Court, this Court must be vigilant in liberal construction of these constitutional requirements to see that their basic intent and purpose is observed.</text>
