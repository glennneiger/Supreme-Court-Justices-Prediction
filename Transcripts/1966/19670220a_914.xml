            <label>Mr. Donald F. Turner</label>
            <text syncTime="50.801" offset="306552">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.923" offset="327032">This and the succeeding case are both direct appeals under the Expediting Act, from judgments, dismissing anti-trust complaints against two bank mergers, one in Houston and one in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.180" offset="392129">Well, the cases are not precisely parallel, the main issues are commendable.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.170" offset="416057">Both we and the Comptroller's officer and intervenor have read them together.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.760" offset="438418">And accordingly, if it is agreeable to the Court, I propose to present more or less a coalesced main argument but I shall of course endeavor to and deal in this first hour with specific issues raised by the defendant Banks in the Houston case.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.237" offset="516368">These cases raised, we believe some basic issues of interpreting the Bank Merger Act of 1966 and before giving you a brief background of the events that led up to the two cases now before you, I think it would be helpful if I quoted the principle provisions of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.001" offset="595362">Section 18 (c) (5) of the Act, provides and I quote, “A federal banking agency shall not approve, and I insert a proposed bank merger, whose effect in any section of the country may be through substantially lessen competition, or tend to create a monopoly, or which in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless it finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served.”</text>
            <text syncTime="167.516" offset="773413">Subparagraph seven provides that in any antitrust action other than under Section 2 of the Sherman Act brought against a merger approved by a federal banking agency and again I quote, “The standards applied by the Court shall be identical with those with the banking agencies are directed to apply,” by the provision that I just quoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.894" offset="874977">And finally, and again I quote, “And that in any such action, the Court shall review de novo the issues presented.”</text>
            <text syncTime="204.009" offset="919385">Now, let me briefly describe to you a -- the background of two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.934" offset="951150">First City National Bank of Houston and Southern National Bank, appellees here, applied as the statute requires to the Comptroller of the Currency for approval of their proposed merger transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.874" offset="1010918">The Comptroller notified the other two approving agencies in the Department of Justice who submitted as the statute requires their assessment of the competitive factors involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.820" offset="1062640">The Federal Reserve Board and the Department of Justice both reported that competitive effects would be adverse, the Department of Justice using the adjective seriously.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.909" offset="1107048">Nevertheless, the Comptroller approved the merger in September 1966, concluding that in his opinion the effects of the merger on competition will not be adverse in the Houston area and that in any event, any anticompetitive effects of the transaction are clearly outweighed in public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the Houston community.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.516" offset="1213419">Thereupon within the 30-days limitation provided for by statute, the Department of Justice filed a complaint, challenging the proposed merger on the ground that it might substantially lessen violation -- lessen competition in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.298" offset="1284577">And the facts that was relied on among others and I will be very sketchy on this were that the acquiring bank was the largest bank in Houston, the Houston area, accounting together with its affiliates were approximately 29.6% of all commercial deposits in Harris County, that the acquired bank was the 6th largest commercial bank in Harris County and with affiliates accounting for about 2.8% of commercial deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.434" offset="1405158">But in addition, Southern was the fastest growing bank in -- in the city having only been recently chartered and it had a young aggressive management which indeed has been cited as one of the reasons for the merger, it being anticipated that that management will play an active, if it not, dominant role in the merge institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.275" offset="1496482">Within a week after the complaint was filed, the Comptroller intervened and next day moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state facts, sufficient to support a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.557" offset="1541622">Defendant banks thereupon filed a motion for dissolution of the statutory stay on the ground, and I quote, “The plaintiff has made no allegation challenging the findings and determinations of the Comptroller than any -- that any anticompetitive effects resulting from a proposed merger are clearly outweighed in the public interest as arbitrary, capricious, and not supported by substantial evidence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="387.106" offset="1651754">Because plaintiff refuses to meet its statutory burdens, said the motion, there is no reasonable probability it will prevail on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.060" offset="1695640">Subsequently at the hearing on December 2nd the District Court ruled as we understand it and as I have been informed by counsel for the Comptroller that they understand it, that the Bank Merger Act of 1966 requires the Government to plead and assume the burden of proving not only that the merger is anticompetitive but also that the competitive injury is not clearly outweighed by the convenience and needs of the community to be served.</text>

            <text syncTime="489.033" offset="2059473">Now, what under that -- what under that view is the significance of the determination of the Comptroller?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_f_turner" startTime="497.375" stopTime="877.859">
            <label>Mr. Donald F. Turner</label>
            <text syncTime="497.375" offset="2092910">That would be an issue which the judge in the Houston case clearly did not reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.045" offset="2123525">It was an issue which we believe was reached by Judge Clary in the Provident case and it is an issue again that we -- we shall have to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.245" offset="2168351">There is as Mr. Justice Fortas suggested, dispute between us and the Houston banks as to the effects of the District Judge's ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.971" offset="2203251">The Houston banks take the position that the judge did not even reach the burden of proof issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.644" offset="2233971">That he simply ruled that the Government had to allege facts from which it could be determined that the convenience and needs did not outweigh.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.764" offset="2274408">And as I indicated I will -- I will take up that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.704" offset="2294157">Now, on the basis of what we understood the ruling of the District Court to be, he -- he entered his order and gave us 10 days to amend our complaint to comply with what he had indicated on the basis of our understanding of what his ruling was.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.773" offset="2386422">We declined to amend believing that the issue is so important and one so deserving of early determination, final determination that it should be taken up fast and accordingly the complaint was dismissed and we brought this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.448" offset="2461132">Now, the Provident case, again at the proposed merging banks, Provident National and Central Penn made their application to the Comptroller of the Currency for approval of their merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.248" offset="2524348">Again, both the Federal Reserve Board and the Department of Justice indicated their view in their reports on competitive factors that there would be significant adverse competitive effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.760" offset="2578369">Again, the Comptroller approved the merger including that rather than having an overall adverse effect on competition and I'm quoting, “It will have a favorable effect further the increased ability of the resulting bank to serve the convenience and needs of the Philadelphia area by increased deficiency and the like makes this merger desirable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="643.276" offset="2676485">Accordingly the -- again, within 30 days the Justice Department filed a complaint alleging that the violation violate -- that the merger violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.707" offset="2722252">And very briefly the facts are that Provident, the acquiring bank is the 5th largest bank in the four-county Philadelphia area accounting for 9% of the area's bank deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.872" offset="2770840">Central Penn, the proposed acquired bank is the 6th largest accounting for approximately 5% of the deposits, the five largest banks in the area already accounted for some 71% deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.053" offset="2843564">From here on the procedural course of this case was slightly different, the Comptroller who again intervened as a party moved to dismiss the complaint on August 11th.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.763" offset="2882435">The defendants also moved to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.666" offset="2894033">They argued in effect that the Government was unwilling to shoulder the burden of proof that the merger was not justified by meeting the convenience and needs of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.074" offset="2931649">But here, the District Court initially denied these motions on the ground that the action was then only at the notice pleading stage and the complaint was adequate to apprise the other parties that the Government believed the merger unlawful under the Clayton Act as modified by the Bank Merger Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.554" offset="3009599">However, shortly thereafter on November 4th, the District Court ruled that in order to prove that the merger was unlawful, the Government would be required to show both of the merger would have substantial anticompetitive effects and that these anticompetitive effects are not clearly outweighed by convenience and needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.070" offset="3095698">The Court then went further and indicated that it would give great weight to the findings of the Comptrollers stating that if it appears that the decision of the Comptroller is dependent upon an exercise of discretion, the Court will vow to that discretion and I close -- quote, “Unless the Comptroller abused, exceeded, or arbitrarily applied it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="770.781" offset="3186500">Now then, the Government subsequently indicated by various filings that it was unwilling to assume the burden of proof upon the convenience and needs issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.350" offset="3232789">Accordingly, the banks and Comptroller again moved for final judgment dismissing the complaint and these motions were granted, and the Government duly appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.374" offset="3284825">Now, in both of the -- there's a -- in both of the cases, the respective District Courts then dissolved the statutory stay provided for in the Bank Merge Act of 1966, stays however were subsequently obtained in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.633" offset="3353893">Now, before proceeding to define what I think the issues are, I think it would be helpful if I indicated to you what is not in dispute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.213" offset="3400182">We do not and did not below dispute that the Bank Merger Act specifies the standards to be applied by the District Court in any antitrust proceeding brought against bank mergers or that the standards are presumably different to some extent from the Clayton Act which would normally apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.719" offset="3514284">The Government in no way has intended to dispute this by drafting its complaints in terms of Section 7 only.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.443" offset="3549184">If any Court had merely requested us to amend their complaints to make reference to the Bank Merger Act, we would have done so even we thought -- even though we thought it was unwarranted for reason I will shortly disclose rather than take so narrow an issue up on appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1584.857" offset="6442820">I think the Department of Justice has continued for reasons of its own to adapt a contrary interpretation, but I consider these cases and I'm paraphrasing as authoritative, at least at this time further I think the petitions fails to state a cause of action in that it alleges only the first step and not the second step which is necessary for the plaintiff to support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.832" offset="6542712">Now, as I say, I -- we -- we read this and I believe the Comptroller does -- is indicating that the judge was in fact dismissing our complaint not only -- not merely for failure to allege facts but on the basis of a further view that he thought the burden proof on the balancing issue was on us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.929" offset="6635081">But let me -- if we assume that this is all that the Court decided, our contention would be that that ruling itself is wrong if the Government is right on the other major issues which are before the Court, that is to say if the Bank Merger Act contemplates an independent determination by the Court and if as we urge the statute clearly sets forth convenience and needs as an exception to a general antitrust standard and as an exception the burden falls on the defendants rather than on the Government, then it seems to us that the judge's holding that we should plead facts pertaining to -- to convenience and needs is just a wrong ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.386" offset="6856913">If the Government does not have the burden of proof on convenience and needs then it clearly state -- the complaint states a prima facie case by alleging only anticompetitive consequences and it is not a defective complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.719" offset="6918248">Moreover, purely as a matter of pleading, a plaintiff does not normally have to alleged facts (Inaudible) and affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.502" offset="6961403">Indeed there have been some cases in the past holding that ill-advised lawyers who assert such facts thereby transfer the burden of proof to themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.026" offset="7007483">So the short of it is -- we believe that even if the ruling made is as narrow as the Houston Bank suggest, it is wrong if we are right on the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.703" offset="7058160">Moreover, and this is my final point on this question, if the Court's ruling was as limited as the Houston Bank suggest and if the narrow ruling was correct neither of which propositions we agree with, it seems to us that fairness would dictate that the case be remanded with the directions that the Government be given lead to amend and our reasons are two, that if the judge rule that way, it was at best terribly unclear and if he had been clear that the Government would -- would have elected to amend rather than taking intermediate appeal on so narrow a point to this Court.</text>
