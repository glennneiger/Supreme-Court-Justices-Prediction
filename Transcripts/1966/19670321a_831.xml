            <text syncTime="39.108" offset="259845">Francis Eddie Specht was convicted in Colorado in 1959 of the crime of indecent liberties and the statute prescribes the punishment of 10 years for that crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.634" offset="309896">He was not sentenced under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.668" offset="322017">He was sentenced under the Sex Offender statute to the only sentence allowed by that statute, an indeterminate sentence of one day to life.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.974" offset="367261">That statute allows a trial judge to sentence people convicted of the crime of indecent liberties and other crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.609" offset="405817">If they fit into a certain classification, the class is a threat to the public if at large or an habitual offender and mentally ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.019" offset="451480">The issue which Francis Eddie Specht presents to this Court is whether he is entitled to participate by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.216" offset="492231">In the process by which the trial judges reaches the conclusion that he is in the class eligible for a different sentence, under the Sex Offender statute that is whether he is a threat to the public if at large or an habitual offender and mentally ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.024" offset="571434">Just a word about the statute, there are certain enumerated offenses, indecent liberties, incest, they're all sex offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.514" offset="621380">The statute says that if a person is convicted of one of those offenses then the district judge, and this is in Section 1 of the statutes in the appendix of the brief, if he has of the -- opinion that such a person is a threat to the public if at large or an habitual offender and mentally ill, may in lieu of the sentence provided by the statute defining the crime sentence him under the Sex Offender statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.234" offset="740289">The Act goes on then to require that the judge have the person psychiatrically examined.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael A. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="283.129" offset="1235884">I don't think that there's a Supreme Court case in Colorado saying that because I don't think there's a case that's exactly raised that.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.401" offset="1276949">But referring, and this is in our brief on page -- begins on page 28 and over the top of 29, Section 5 of the Act, it says, “Whenever a District Court after a psychiatric examination of and report on a person convicted of any one or more of the crimes shall be of the opinion that it would be to the best interest of justice to sentence such a person under the provisions of this Article.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.462" offset="1377259">He shall cause such person to be arraigned before him and sentenced”.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.388" offset="1392933">Now, I believe that if you're going to give meaning to that you have to say that after the examination, after this information gathering procedure has occurred, he can then decide that he does not want to sentence him under the Sex Offender statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.365" offset="1452805">And that emphasizes, Your Honor, the critical aspect that we say that this information gathering process is.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.873" offset="1478823">The determination whether the man fits this classification and is eligible for this sentencing.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.606" offset="1509752">He can be sentenced under the statute applicable to the particular offense without the psychiatric examination having been ordered.</text>

            <text syncTime="363.166" offset="1556041">I believe that the pre-sentence investigation report is in every case required by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.627" offset="1577880">But the psychiatric examination is peculiar to this and this emphasizes in our view, this -- the fact that the statute provides this classification, these standards which this man has to meet before he can be sentenced and provide an information gathering process emphasizes that the legislature meant that these statutes were important and they have to be met and they gave a mechanism to be sure that they were met.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.577" offset="1693654">And what they didn't do and what the statute doesn't do as construed by the Courts in Colorado was give the person who is convicted a right to participate in that information gathering process by which the judge makes the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.080" offset="1751646">Now, whether you call it discretion, whether you say he -- that he must be of the opinion, he has to reach a state of mind that that man is in that classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.804" offset="1786546">And we say, let us at least know what information you are facing that up.</text>

            <text syncTime="433.195" offset="1836178">And we say that the Fourteenth Amendment entitles us to do this, to participate in this process and to correct errors in information upon which the judge relies.</text>

            <text syncTime="464.852" offset="1962820">In other words, if that statute says you can give him 10 years or if you find he's in this class, then you can give him one day to life.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.880" offset="1990928">My position would be the same because it seems to me that what the legislature has done and the Colorado Supreme Court said this too.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.752" offset="2026350">As -- they have said they're only certain people you can do this too, threats to the public or habitual offenders and mentally ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.286" offset="2056547">In the Vanderhoof case, citing Colorado and that cited in our brief, the -- that -- that those -- the objection made by Mr. Vanderhoof, he said, "This Act is unconstitutional because it just gives the judge carte blanche to do what he wants".</text>
            <text syncTime="502.727" offset="2114330">And the Colorado Supreme Court said, “Oh, no, it doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.244" offset="2124361">He merely finds a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.488" offset="2129272">The legislature has made the classification”.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.756" offset="2142438">And so we say that because that fact -- well, in one of the phrase of this Court is of critical importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.397" offset="2184965">He is entitled to participate in the decision-making process.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.140" offset="2207953">In another line of authority in this Court, the recidivist cases it's essentially independent of the fact of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.773" offset="2246510">The fact that he is a threat to the public or an habitual offender and mentally ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.072" offset="2263646">And this Court has said that in those cases, the person is entitled to participate because of the due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment in the decision-making process.</text>

            <text syncTime="689.662" offset="2862059">The Colorado statute is identical in all material respects I think to the Pennsylvania statute, the Barr-Walker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.054" offset="2911587">The Barr-Walker Act was enacted in 1951; the Colorado statute in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.613" offset="2933844">And I think the copy -- the Third Circuit considered the Barr-Walker Act in the case of United States against Maroney, which is cited in our brief, and they said that this process, this Act, wherein when a man is convicted of a crime, then an inquiry is made whether he has some additional characteristics, some additional attributes, maybe he has them, he gets a much more severe punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.847" offset="3054738">They said that would define a new criminal status.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.752" offset="3070412">And because it's a new criminal status, he has to have the entire -- the full panoply of procedural rights consistent with that then they argued about the question of whether the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the right to jury trial and they didn't agree on that but they agreed on everything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.677" offset="3138121">And if that's correct, this is the same case.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.715" offset="3166229">As I indicated, the recidivist cases are relevant, pertinent that it -- this is an -- as punishment at the very least.</text>

            <text syncTime="818.728" offset="3378239">Interesting -- interestingly enough however, the Colorado Supreme Court has said he has not bound by that psychiatrist's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.599" offset="3409795">And that's that the case of Trueblood against Tinsley, the first Colorado case in which the constitutionality of this statute was before the Colorado Court and in that case, the psychiatrist report said this man is not mentally ill and it didn't say that he was a threat to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.215" offset="3476250">Now, it was somewhat ambiguous I think on whether it was enough of a basis to -- well, whether it was required, it affirmatively said that he's a threat to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.754" offset="3522435">But the Colorado Supreme Court said, “We're going to accept your argument, Mr. Trueblood that this psychiatrist report doesn't -- really affirmatively support the judge's action but the judge isn't bound by it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="871.520" offset="3589413">Actually, I think they were saying the same thing here that the same instruction we give to juries in Colorado every time there's an expert witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.813" offset="3618670">Say, you're the trier of fact and you can hear all the facts and you can accept that expert's opinion as it appeals to your reason and intellect.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.475" offset="3649285">And I think they were saying the same thing here to the judge or that -- to Mr. Trueblood, they're saying the judge can decide the facts on the basis of his and the rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.763" offset="3682408">And as far as I know, the rest was as a pre-sentence investigation report.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.919" offset="3715009">The authority that has been -- I won't say, consistently say that against us because the first time that was decided against us, it -- is in the Tenth Circuit by Judge Murray is the case of Williams against New York in which this Court said that -- I think that was a pretty narrow holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.399" offset="3788988">It was the question in -- the holding in that case that the judge can't consider information developed out of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.670" offset="3830053">That he is not limited to listening to information developed in court with cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.494" offset="3857324">But that holding has been expanded by the Tenth Circuit and is argued before this Court in a greatly expanded sense to justify a procedure where not only is the judge considered the information developed out of court but he doesn't tell you what it is?</text>
            <text syncTime="954.064" offset="3919600">You can't see it if you asked so there's no way of knowing it if it's wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="2242.244" offset="9072306">The basic scheme there provided is that a petition is filed and the petition is usually based upon the allegation of a criminal charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2261.220" offset="9148270">Yet, this can form a basis for a man's commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.647" offset="9173974">The second is a civil commitment procedure which operates ancillary to a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.423" offset="9205112">This letter form takes two shapes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.313" offset="9216606">One is set in motion by a petition prior to conviction; the other permits the filing of a petition to commit after conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.749" offset="9270418">Some provide that if commit -- civil commitment is ordered, the criminal charges are dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.780" offset="9290480">However, the majority of states provide that when recovery is affected, the defendant is remanded to the trial court for either trial or execution of his sentence, a procedure, which in our judgment is, could be said and has been said by some to be self-defeating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.525" offset="9373445">In any event, this discussion in our judgment serves to show -- to establish only one thing and that is what procedure or what scheme the state adopts is a matter of wisdom of policy, one which should be addressed properly to the state legislature.</text>

            <text syncTime="3004.142" offset="12119960">First, we went to the benefit of the Pennsylvania Court which is a procedural due process question purely and simply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.597" offset="12157785">And then, we end up in our reply brief saying that all that is required is substantial justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.055" offset="12183594">Well, we have never denied the sense of substantial justice should not be afforded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.796" offset="12206582">We should never deny the due process, should not afforded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.454" offset="12221210">We think due process should be afforded in each and every stage of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.488" offset="12237302">The question is, what is the shape and form of due process which attaches to sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.384" offset="12272933">I think the Court very clearly said what that is in Townson versus Berg and that is a question of fair play.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.396" offset="12300936">The same questions here addressed to the Court, we think, were disposed of in Wanes versus New York and Wanes versus Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.597" offset="12349733">We think that the Third Circuit draws a very insubstantial distinction to justify its finding or its determination that this is a separate trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.447" offset="12397171">And of course, the Court does not tell us what is the quantity or quality or shape performed of due process which attaches to the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.042" offset="12427577">So it's difficult for us to respond to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.295" offset="12436564">In any event, the Court drew the analogy, the principal premise and their -- so logistic approach was that they drew analogy between this law and the habitual criminal law and relied on these Court's decisions in Oyler and Fretag, Chandler versus Fretag.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.415" offset="12541053">We say number one, the Third Circuit misinterpreted the holdings in those two decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.698" offset="12566131">I think the only question addressed to the Court in both of those decisions was whether or not the defendant was entitled to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.648" offset="12613987">And the Oyler case that went on that he was also entitled to reasonable notice which we would think would be obvious under any sentencing hearing in order to have effective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.458" offset="12669158">Very obviously, he must have a reasonable notice of the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.903" offset="12694967">Going to the procedurals, the third point, in any event as to habitual criminal act, why do we say that it is not analogous?</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.851" offset="12734777">We say that we would like to be unshackled from the habitual criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.036" offset="12759542">This, the habitual criminal law has one purpose in mind and that is punishment alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.453" offset="12785142">We submit that it represents the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.256" offset="12796426">We have tried to reject the habitual criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.513" offset="12809383">It has essentially become functus oficio in Colorado and we have gone almost entirely to the indeterminate type sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.150" offset="12852015">So if we're bound by, as the Third Circuit says the habitual criminal law, then we will be mired so to speak in the past and will be unable to progress to the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.306" offset="12900603">The other is, there's a finding of fact and we say this is unsubstantial/insubstantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.535" offset="12921501">If this is true, Colorado can overcome that point by the simple device of eliminating the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.432" offset="12953057">Well, it's a separate statutory section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.236" offset="12964342">Well, we can eliminate that objection too by a simple device of amending the indecent liberty statute and adding thereto most of our statute, statute providing or I won't say most but many of our statutes providing for sentencing or in separate sections.</text>

            <text syncTime="3637.629" offset="14653837">May I respond to that, Your Honor?</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.252" offset="14664391">The inference here is that he would have had the right that Colorado courts might let him see that psychiatrist report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.637" offset="14697932">In his petition, in this page 7 of the record, he says, “In Court, counsel for petitioner and the District Attorney were reading the hospital's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.872" offset="14734817">The petitioner attempted to read the same over his counsel shoulder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.624" offset="14749863">The Court had much.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.004" offset="14755401">Petitioner Mr. Specht, report is solely for your counsel and District Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.307" offset="14772642">Behind this legal wire certain of secrecy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.785" offset="14782464">Petitioner was sentence”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.758" offset="14786435">That's what he says here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.559" offset="14793644">And as Mr. Bush says, there'd be no evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.019" offset="14807437">When he responded to this in the federal court, he didn't say that so specifically or that is so specifically just said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.355" offset="14840769">Everything that isn't admitted is denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.242" offset="14852368">And that was his response to their.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.347" offset="14860727">And -- and if we're going to go, Your Honor, we have the Supreme Court record, that Francis Eddie Specht put before the Supreme Court of Colorado when he said this sentence is unconstitutional and one of the reasons that he said that's unconstitutional is because he says that he was not able to look at the psychiatrist report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.410" offset="14965008">That's in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.041" offset="14971486">And Mr. Bush, well, I don't know if Mr. Bush or the Attorney General wrote the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.649" offset="14989981">Responding to that, and I said, on the petitioner's report, he alleges that the sentencing procedure denied him equal protection of laws and due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.909" offset="15023000">This first phase is for this attack is that at the time of sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.520" offset="15033448">He was not afforded due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.828" offset="15042644">This assertion is apparently based on a false premise that the sentencing must be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the trial such as examination of the psychiatrist report and the right to cross-examining the expert's submitting a report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.529" offset="15113488">We know of no principle which requires an opportunity to be heard as to the information upon which the judge may properly rely or utilized in determining the proper sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.893" offset="15154970">That's what the Attorney General said in the Supreme Court of Colorado and the Supreme Court of Colorado in their opinion says, Mr. Specht several contentions as to the constitutionality of the statute are not properly founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.187" offset="15200110">So, they clearly said and he has said consistently, “I ought to be able to look and I ought to know”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.557" offset="15225605">And the Supreme Court of Colorado said, “No, sir”.</text>
