            <text syncTime="30.779" offset="226513">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.470" offset="245217">My client, Ralph Berger was convicted in a state prosecution for conspiracy to bribe the chairman of the New York State Liquor Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.187" offset="284087">His conviction was affirmed by the appellate courts in the State of New York and in each instance without opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.767" offset="318464">However, in the Court of Appeals, then Judge -- Chief Judge Desmond and Judge Fold, now Chief Judge Fold dissented in an opinion which appears at page 691 of the record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.945" offset="379173">The questions before this Court as limited by the order allowing certiorari are found at page 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.351" offset="420760">They involve the constitutionality of the New York State permissive eavesdrop statute and on the assumption of constitutionality of such statute whether the ex parte orders for secret electronic bugging were made on adequate showing of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.413" offset="513024">Prior to the trial, a motion was made on behalf of petitioner to suppress evidence and leads thereto on the ground that the same were obtained in violation of his constitutional rights by trespassory electronic bugging of constitutionally protected areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.316" offset="596616">That motion to suppress was denied, was lead to renew before the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.908" offset="623052">At the outset of the trial, during the proceedings under the renewed motion to suppress, the parties entered into a stipulation under which it was agreed that without the evidence and the leads obtained from the electronic eavesdrop devices placed in certain private offices, there was no information to present to a grand jury or on the basis of which to prosecute the petitioner and that all of the evidence and all of the leads thereto were activities at those two locations.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.196" offset="768188">The electronic bugs in those private offices were installed under authorizing officers -- orders, I beg your pardon, issued ex parte by a state judge pursuant to Section 813 (a) of the New York Code of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.466" offset="849272">Those orders made on April 10, 1962 and of June 16, 1962 for the separate premises involved, permitted the prosecutor, his agents, and police working under his direction, and I quote “to overhear and record by means of any instrument, any and all conversations, communications and discussions, that may take place between the persons present in the above mentioned room and to do all things necessary to permit said conversations, communications, and discussions to be overheard and recorded.”</text>
            <text syncTime="229.884" offset="1022934">The ex parte orders renewed the eavesdropping for 60 days and were thereafter renewed for additional similar periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.482" offset="1061282">Later in my discussion I shall advert to the -- in detail to the question as to whether they were submitted to the judge who made the orders, adequate proof to support a finding of probable cause as required by the Fourth Amendment of our federal constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="874.511" offset="3601429">We then present to this Court two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.497" offset="3613341">Firstly, whether the New York ex parte judicial permissive eavesdrop statute may constitutionally authorize under the Fourteenth Amendment and as our amicus Civil Liberties Union urges under the First Amendment, a trespassory intrusion by electronic bugging in private premises to make a general search for evidence to support a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.448" offset="3713128">Secondly, on the assumption that the Fourth Amendment constitutionality of that statute is satisfied, where the ex parte orders for those room eavesdrops based on an adequate showing of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.578" offset="3773733">It appears that this is the first case in which this Court is called upon to consider the merits of the constitutional question of whether otherwise unconstitution -- constitutional trespassory room bugging can be made constitutional by an advanced ex parte judicial order and whether a State statute setting up such a system is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.549" offset="3885537">The recent Osborn decision does not reach this issue and I shall refer to Osborn in my discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.352" offset="3920750">It is true that in Osborn, a form of electronic monitoring was approved on the basis of advanced judicial permission and it is true that in Osborn, several of the justices of this Court, joined in the decision apparently because this judicial permission was deemed to remove the constitutional objections under the particular facts in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.705" offset="4030151">In the first place, Osborn involved a “minifon” device and not a surreptitious intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.789" offset="4062542">The “minifon” problem has always until now been regarded by this Court differently from the trespassory room bug.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.520" offset="4105488">Minifon type activity was approved by this Court in the On Lee and Lopez cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.932" offset="4131088">Trespassory room bugging has been disapproved since the Silverman decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.335" offset="4156688">It cannot be argued from this that the factor of advanced judicial permission in the Osborn “minifon” situation where the justices who had dissented or otherwise differed from the majority in On Lee and Lopez joined in the Osborn majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.353" offset="4228786">It cannot be argued from this that Osborn has settled for all purposes and for all types of electronic monitoring, the problem of advanced judicial permission as a cure or otherwise unconstitutional electronic eavesdropping.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.417" offset="4293047">Aside from the distinction between a “minifon” device and a room bug in private premises, Osborn is distinguishable from our case on several other grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.822" offset="4338709">And Osborn fails to solve the entire problem of advanced judicial permission for several other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.191" offset="4372146">We have set forth in detail in our brief at pages 58 -- 55 to 58, the several distinguishing points affecting Osborn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.559" offset="4413628">Above all, there is the matter of specifically limiting the monitoring -- the electronic monitoring which it was possible to do in Osborn where they were aiming at a specific scheduled conversation to be held at a specific time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.407" offset="4488965">But how can this be remotely compared to a 60-day general room bugging order to overhear all conversations in a private place?</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.923" offset="4531075">Whatever principles or standards maybe derived from the forms of the judicial permission which was approved in Osborn, those principles and standards cannot possibly be satisfied by 813 (a) of the New York statute and they have not been satisfied in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.421" offset="7153037">For example, should the constitutional right of privacy be subject to judicially permitted electronic intrusion without limit as to what kind of crime the police eavesdropper is seeking?</text>

            <text syncTime="1781.761" offset="7230464">For example also, should the constitutional right of privacy be subjected to judicially permitted intrusion without even defining at all in the judicial warrant, what private conversations criminal or non-criminal maybe be searched?</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.303" offset="7304547">Is that the way it was done in Osborn?</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.194" offset="7316146">The New York statute, however, permits such search and indeed, it makes it inevitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.862" offset="7342791">It seems to us indisputable that this particular statute goes too far by any rational standard of our privacy traditions under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.354" offset="7388766">The argument on this point could end here without going on to ask, what kind of a better statute might satisfy the Constitution?</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.580" offset="7425651">We take it that the Court maybe interested in having us explore the question in its broader extensions and for that reason, we have included in our brief a discussion of the broader policy implications of judicially permitted electronic eavesdropping.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.100" offset="7491793">And the conclusion which we have proposed is again that no system of judicial permission can satisfy the Constitution for any case of electronic search where the purpose is criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.281" offset="7556472">I've asked myself whether some position short of this perhaps could be worked out to allow judicially permitted electronic eavesdropping for criminal prosecutions and I have not been able to find a constitutionally, logical or palatable answer short of outright ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.305" offset="7636616">One reason, why we have believe that necessary to formulate our position is the advent of the age of the parabolic microphone and no one knows what has yet to come?</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.221" offset="7692204">I have not yet touched on the subject of Fifth Amendment self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.407" offset="7712998">The Court is frequently spoken of the interplay feature as between the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.377" offset="7736926">The indiscriminate character of electronic room bugging and the warrants in this case, make it inevitable that Fifth Amendment rights as well as the Fourth Amendment rights are immediately threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.644" offset="7789902">The rights are threatened both through the general search that is intrinsically involved in any such indiscriminate room bugging and they are threatened even more acutely in this case by the search for mere evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.400" offset="7853014">In fact, the search for mere evidence is the expressly declared purpose under the New York statute and under the warrants issued in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.850" offset="7902751">I come now to our second point, that is, assuming the federal constitutionality of Section 813, we asked whether the ex parte eavesdropping orders authorizing the intrusion nevertheless are invalid under the Fourth Amendment because they were not based upon an adequate showing of probable clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.665" offset="7994075">These ex parte orders here were secured on application to a judge under the provision of that statute 813 (a).</text>

            <text syncTime="2729.727" offset="11022294">Our aim in this matter is to define electronic eavesdropping as a search and seizure, subject to the control of the Fourth Amendment and capable of judicial regulation there under as any other search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.907" offset="11098990">We believe that in electronic eavesdropping under the Fourth Amendment there can be lawful means of acquiring evidence when it is executed and carried out in conformity with traditional Fourth Amendment regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.790" offset="11162520">It should not be too difficult to define it as a search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.288" offset="11176521">This Court has already regarded it as a Fourth Amendment question in another context in the Silverman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.226" offset="11212257">Indeed it is strongly analogous to conventional search and seizure for tangible objects, a primary difference being that what is sought in the case of an eavesdrop is words or speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.924" offset="11271084">Indeed, this is not so different from a conventional search and seizure when the object of that search is also words recorded in the nature of invoices, checks, bills, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.731" offset="11334301">This is indeed a more sophisticated means of search and seizure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2847.571" offset="11493648">I -- I'm aware Justice Fortas of the Boyd doctrine in which the Fourth and the Fifth Amendments are in a sense blended and indeed in that era and in the emerging understanding of civil liberties protected by these Amendments, there was some language about the compulsion of a search and seizure or of a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.088" offset="11603675">I suggest that the Fifth Amendment has no place in our contemporary understanding of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.740" offset="11626350">It has no place in a search and seizure situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2890.492" offset="11665324">The Fifth Amendment has no place where it is for physical substance such as a man's blood obtained from the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.164" offset="11696044">Was there a compulsion when blood was taken in Schmerber?</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.617" offset="11709837">I should say that there was the most oblivious sort of compulsion in the sense that a man against his will was held down while his veins were pierced.</text>

            <text syncTime="5688.589" offset="22857749">Indeed it depends for its effectiveness on being surreptitious.</text>
            <text syncTime="5692.829" offset="22874676">It could hardly be argued that eavesdropping should be permitted only if a presentation of the order is made to the suspect prior to the time that the bug is installed.</text>

            <text syncTime="5718.388" offset="22976972">It does not offend Fourteenth Amendment principles of Due Process.</text>
            <text syncTime="5722.736" offset="22994317">I suggest once again that it is nothing but another variety of a very common more enforcement investigative technique and that is surreptitiousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5733.406" offset="23036949">Let us take for example the simplest form which I doubt anyone could argue was contrary to constitutional principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="5740.031" offset="23063489">And that is following a man, surveillance by keeping him in sight, and going with him wherever he goes secretly, recording his movements.</text>
            <text syncTime="5749.178" offset="23100061">Is that an invasion of privacy?</text>
            <text syncTime="5750.503" offset="23105390">It is, but indeed, there's not even a requirement for a warrant for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5755.121" offset="23123884">Perhaps, they should be, but I would suggest that with or without a warrant, it has never been challenged as a secret surveillance and an invasion of privacy because of its secrecy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5767.988" offset="23175293">This is true indeed of many law enforcement techniques, some of which was sanctioned by this Court in this term such as for example, the purchase of narcotics by a person who is masquerading as a narcotics user.</text>

            <text syncTime="5791.076" offset="23267662">Is the fact of secrecy, the fact of deception there in and of itself so essentially repugnant to our notions of liberty and privacy as to invalidate it, I think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5803.952" offset="23319176">So here too, I think that the element of secrecy the fact that the entry to install a bug was surreptitious indeed would have been the crime of burglary, had it not been for the order.</text>
