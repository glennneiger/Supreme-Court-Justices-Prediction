            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 216, National Labor Relations Board, Petitioner, versus Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company et al.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="26.604" offset="209795">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.264" offset="232469">This is a review of a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit where that Court sitting en banc in a four to three vote, the National Labor Relations Board dismissed of unfair labor practice charged by the Allis-Chalmers Company against two locals of the United Automobile Workers Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.374" offset="324838">This was based on the unions imposing fines upon union members who crossed the union picket lines during several two strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.311" offset="372590">The facts are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.341" offset="384711">Locals 248 and 401 of the UAW for many years represented the employees of Allis-Chalmers, two plants in particular, the West Allis and the La Crosse both in Wisconsin plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.540" offset="453569">In 1959 and again in 1962, each of these locals called economic strikes against the company in furtherance of its contract demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.237" offset="508322">The 1959 strike lasted about two months, from February 2 to April 19 and during that strike, 175 employees out of a unit of some 7400 crossed the picket lines at West Allis, and two at La Crosse.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.759" offset="594422">The 1962 strike lasted about a week and during that strike, 30 out of a unit of 5500 or so crossed the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.484" offset="637262">In accordance with the procedure specified in the union's constitution and bylaws, these strike working members were found by Union Trial Board to have engaged in "Conduct unbecoming a union member" and they were fined amounts ranging from $20 to $100 each.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.478" offset="733288">Some members paid the fines and others refused to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.549" offset="757530">And the union commenced actions and to collect the fines in the state courts in Wisconsin, and one case was used as a test case, and the union obtained the judgment against a member who had crossed the line and had refused to pay the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.215" offset="828270">And the opinion of the Wisconsin intermediate appellate court which upheld this judgment of the trial court is set forth in the appendix to our main brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.037" offset="871528">The opinion of the trial court is not in our record but it is in the record that's deposited with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.344" offset="904756">This particular case is now pending in the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and so far as I know it's not yet been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.328" offset="940701">None of the strike-making members has been expelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.136" offset="963897">None of them had been suspended from the union, nor if any of them resigned because of the fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.515" offset="997439">On the other hand, the union has done nothing whatsoever in any way to affect the employment status of these members who were fined.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.085" offset="1039757">And so the question here is whether the union fining of these members for crossing the picket line and the subsequent attempt to collect the fines by court action constitutes a violation of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) of the National Labor Relations Act which makes it an unfair labor practice for a union to restrain or coerce employees and the exercise of a right guaranteed by Section 7 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.620" offset="1165876">Section 7 in turn gives employees the right both to engage and to refrain from engaging in concerted union activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.418" offset="1213001">The Board itself where its member lead them dissenting, held that the union conduct complained of by the company did not violate Section 8 (b) (1) (A), and upon the company's petition for review to the Seventh Circuit, a panel of judges, Judges Kiley, Judge Knoch and Judge Castle upheld the Board's dismissal of the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.108" offset="1327835">Upon rehearing on en banc, the Court withdrew the panel's original decision and held with Chief Judge Hastings and Judges Kiley and Swygert dissenting that the union action did constitute an unfair labor practice under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.666" offset="1410069">The Court accordingly set aside the Board's order and remanded the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.808" offset="1438595">Here, we are dealing with something that I doubt anyone will dispute is vital to the unions, vital to all unions, to their effectiveness as collective bargaining agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.273" offset="1504423">We think the legislative history of the Act makes clear that Congress did not intend to proscribe the union disciplinary conduct here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.569" offset="1549667">And that the limited scope of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) is confirmed by provisions of the later labor management reporting in Disclosure Act of 1959, as well as by practical considerations of effective unionism within the context of the federal labor laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.701" offset="1630124">We also contend that no violation of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) was established because the fined union member employees were not deprived of any right protected by Section 7 since they had already opted against refraining from concerted activities by merely being members of -- becoming members of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.000" offset="1731375">We acknowledge of course that the fine --</text>

            <text syncTime="410.407" offset="1744959">Section 7 as you said gives all employees the right to engage in or to refrain from concerted activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.694" offset="1786128">And as I understood your argument you just made is once they joined the union, they opted to engage in all concerted activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.258" offset="1828446">This mean anything the union does and then on they're stuck with, they're stopped from objecting to it?</text>

            <text syncTime="435.532" offset="1845478">Not anything, but they have agreed by joining the union to be governed by majority rule of that union.</text>

            <text syncTime="1107.455" offset="4533164">Mr. Justice Brennan, we're trying to find it but it was between 21 and 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.569" offset="4561690">I would like to now move over to the case of the National Labor Relations Board versus Drivers Local 639, the Curtis Brothers case, which is in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.418" offset="4609024">And in there the meaning of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) was decided -- determined by this Court on the basis that you couldn't do it by examining the language alone, and that's really what happened in the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.209" offset="4676211">In Curtis, you recalled, was held at peaceful recognitional picketing by a minority union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.962" offset="4703169">It was not prohibited by that section, notwithstanding that such picketing tended in the literal sense to restrain or coerce Curtis' employees in exercise of their Section 7 right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.656" offset="4761997">And in so holding, this Court stressed the basic congressional purpose in the Labor Act, and the balance and compromise reflected in it intent which is not necessary made clear in the vague language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.209" offset="4824168">Now, as to the particular action here, there are certain things that I believe there can be little disagreement with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.177" offset="4872129">The membership in the union is not compulsory in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.197" offset="4900133">Secondly, that the allegiance to a duly authorized economic strike is a very basis in any union activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.740" offset="4954363">And where reasonable fines are often made, there are much less rigorous, less coercive if you please than summary expulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.251" offset="5016325">And then the policy of the Act in question here is to aid collective bargaining, and in aid to collective bargaining requires that the union maintain as much solidarity as it can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.965" offset="5099186">I say secondly that from the outset the Board has held that -- that Section 8 (b) (1) (A) does not prohibit union disciplinary sanctions that are neither tinged with violence nor directed at employment status, and would seek to compel union members to comply with reasonable and legitimate union policies, or to use an old trite phrase as long as you use in legitimate means for the legitimate end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.860" offset="5258846">The Board has been able to find that there is no violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.236" offset="5280266">Implicit in this gain is a principle of course as I've mentioned on majority rule, and we bear that the history of the bill when Senator Ball, which we set out in our brief at page 24, said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.100" offset="5347767">As to what rights were being impaired and what rights were not being impaired?</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.329" offset="5372740">Senator Ball said, "All we are trying to cover is the coercive and restraining action of the union in its efforts to organize unorganized employees".</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.850" offset="5426761">And he also said, "What we are talking about is threats of violence or reprisal and that sort of thing in an organizational campaign or perhaps in an organizational strike".</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.543" offset="5489560">Both of those statements emphasize they're talking about organizational strikes and they're talking about violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.754" offset="5554343">The meaning of the old point is that for example no one questions the propriety of fines for violations of a no-strike vote, similarly no one questions that a union might expel a member who violates a strike called by the union members, in any rational purpose served by permitting expulsion but still prohibiting fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.032" offset="5675551">We submit that there is no distinction between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.933" offset="5691120">This means chosen a fine and collection of it in the Courts is a very antithesis of the type of oppression tactics that we were talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.435" offset="5737096">The issue may be approached on the other hand by saying that the union's action did not violate Section 8 (b) (1) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.964" offset="5771264">And our difference is with the court below that the court below says, "Read the statute and coercion means coercion".</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.044" offset="5811597">We prefer to rely upon the Board's ruling and the decision of the original panel which seems to say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.438" offset="5853080">One, the NLRB Board's opinion, that its holding was specifically restricted to an area involving the status of the member of the union rather than as an employee of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.222" offset="5932283">Secondly, the Board emphasized that the fine is restricted to its own members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.661" offset="5962062">Third, the Board says, "The rule prohibiting crossing picket lines is certainly within the covenants of the union".</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.313" offset="5996648">It involves a loyalty of its members during a time of crisis for the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.987" offset="6023293">And finally the Board's opinion says, "When the strike is lawful and the picket line is lawful, we cannot hold that a union must take no steps to preserve its own integrity".</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.221" offset="6088286">I submit that in the position of the Board in this case, it is one that there is no violation of 8 (b) (1) (A) and that insofar as Section 7 is concerned, it merely emphasizes that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.553" offset="6149622">And Mr. Chief Justice if I can hold my five minutes?</text>

            <text syncTime="1525.126" offset="6203852">On behalf of the union, we have the temerity to suggest that there are really four separate and conclusive reasons why we have -- the union has not violated the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.188" offset="6244080">The first is that union discipline of members is exempted from the Labor Board's jurisdiction by the text on legislative history of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) and its proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.830" offset="6282742">The second reason is that in Section 7 of the Act, every employee has the choice of abstention from or participation in concerted protected activity, but once the worker chooses to join the union, he is bound to his election of participation over former statutory right of abstention.</text>

            <text syncTime="1609.679" offset="6542085">In a moment I would like to outline my four points and then I'll certainly will cover this -- this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.845" offset="6562774">We would urge that it is not a violation of the statute, even if the -- the unreasonableness in the enforcement of the internal union rules, procedural or otherwise, may be a basis of a Landrum-Griffin, a Griffin violation it is, it's a procedural violation but not NLRA violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.519" offset="6625468">The third ground upon which we believe this Labor Board's decision in this case was right, is that there must be some rule of reason in the application of the restraint or coerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.192" offset="6652113">There's been a rule of reason in the restraint clause of the Sherman Act for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.319" offset="6688684">We see no reason for denying one here, and if there's any rule of reason in what constitute restraint or coercion under this statutory clause, we are within the most reasonableness of all the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.503" offset="6729435">And fourth, and perhaps the most important point we would make is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.365" offset="6744795">This Court in American Ship Building rules that the employer can enforce a concerted work refusal on every member of the union and every employee as a bargaining device.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.403" offset="6785024">And the statute becomes incongruous and imbalanced if now labor unions can no longer enforce a concerted work refusal even on their own members.</text>

            <text syncTime="1751.392" offset="7108942">And I -- and I say this to Mr. Justice Brennan literalism in the construction of this statute is a trap.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.393" offset="7132975">And we think if we're going to have literalism, the company has fallen into the trap because we believe we are literally excluded by the proviso of Section 8 (b) (1) from the coverage of 8 Section (b) (1) itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.870" offset="7178846">If the Court will indulge me by looking at page 3 of the blue brief, at the very top, the actual text of the proviso which is rarely looked at in these debates is reprinted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.643" offset="7221896">And if we will mentally block out two words from the proviso, the words or retention for the moment, we have this left.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.150" offset="7251989">The statutes shall not impair the right of the labor organization to prescribe its own rules with respect to the acquisition of membership therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.334" offset="7288665">Now, why do I say that there's a violation of this guarantee if we have violated the Act in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.603" offset="7309772">It's very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.778" offset="7314474">The cardinal rule with respect to the acquisition of membership in this union is that you shall abide by the union norm and submit the union discipline if you go in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.347" offset="7352717">And at page 36 of the record there is printed the -- this actual requirement of membership which is then duplicated by the oath of membership, but it says expressly that every applicants shall sign upon this to abide by all laws, rules or regulations and the constitution of the international union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.360" offset="7416769">And therefore, we say that there has been the most direct violation of this reserved right in the statute if now we can no longer prescribe the rule that someone who comes into the union shall support a strike and shall submit himself to traditional union discipline if he fails to support a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.790" offset="7482493">And we don't believe in their rules, but if we're going to have it we'd say that we ae legally within this proviso.</text>

            <text syncTime="1893.019" offset="7675486">And we believe in that -- and we believe in Street now and we believe it applies under National Labor Relations Act as well, though this Court has not yet so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.338" offset="7704743">And that is just another reason why the choice that Congress made in 1947 should be on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.767" offset="7730448">The choice was you cannot be compelled to be a member of the union, but if you are a union member then you must march with the union as unionists always have because it's a cause which requires unanimity and concert of action, and not at the loose individualism on the liberal doctrine questions like the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.537" offset="7797530">Let me get to the point to which is second argument is that there is an election by the union members to which he can be held when he joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.588" offset="7829713">This Court has long ago as Elgin, Joliet held that a union member may validly be deemed to have surrendered to the union his contractual and statutory right with respect to alleged violations of his contract and make the union -- oe validly make the union his bargaining agents with power to waive away and bargain away and settle any individual agreements of his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.960" offset="7919261">We feel that the election that this Court permitted in Elgin, Joliet is a principle which can be applied equally here that one who chooses to join the union since 1947 at least, one who chooses to -- to join the union when he not need the union, he may refrain from joining must be held to the union norm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.134" offset="7991881">Now, union start as critical in this setting if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.705" offset="8006196">In 1951 the Seventh Circuit which has jurisdiction in Wisconsin where this case arose, was presented with precisely the following situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.873" offset="8038902">A number of employees said, "Here are our union dues but we are not coming to the meeting to take the oaths of membership".</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.472" offset="8065233">And the Labor Board held that when they were then discharged by the employer for nonpayment of dues which the union refused to take, the Act was violated because it exceeded the power of the union to do anything more than to require them to pay the dues and requiring the oath of membership was not committed under the statute and no employment discipline could be imposed under the statute for failure to take the oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.643" offset="8149974">Since 1951 as this Court's General Motors decision and Radio Officers decisions have also confirmed therefore, it is clear that no one must join the union on paying the union discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.006" offset="8199398">And therefore we say there is no longer of a real difference in the case such before this Court and another case that might be here where there's no union security clause at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.901" offset="8234924">The union just tells any member who decides to join and then imposes a fine on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.203" offset="8252165">And we think it'd be absolutely idiosyncratic to presume that Congress meant in a non-union security clause situation to bar unions from suspending or fining or otherwise disciplining their members or officers and we see no different result flowing here since 1947 when compulsory membership was barred by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.088" offset="8327711">Now it is said that employees do not know that they need not join the union, but we think companies like Allis-Chalmers which has fought this case with bigger advice employees of their rights with respect to joining the union or not joining the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.897" offset="8378911">Furthermore, President Brewster of the United Automobile Workers has not made a secret of the fact that members or that employees need not join the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.487" offset="8409318">At page 12 of our brief, there's a lengthy footnote of his public testimony some two or three years ago categorically affirming that no one needs to join the union and bind himself to its norm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.889" offset="8450905">Finally, the contract here itself doesn't require union membership as it might have under the strict readings of Section 8 (a) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.884" offset="8478908">It says, "You shall be a member of the union to the extent of paying monthly dues and no more".</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.423" offset="8505031">So we think that the argument that people are losing their rights by ignorance has some way than some other context but not in this particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2178.449" offset="8817142">So we say it has to cut both ways and it's in an added idiosyncrasy and incongruity if unions are now to be deprived of their traditional discipline with respect to the strike, whichever way it goes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2209.311" offset="8940648">There, the members of the union were fined $25 but the union constitution said that $10 was the maximum fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.967" offset="8971264">The Court, on the instance of the fined members, ordered the fines remitted and the members restored to full status, $15 more than the maximum of ten was enough to invoke the usual authority of the common law courts to bar any sanction against the member who had in fact violated the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.344" offset="9044720">We say the answer to your questions about excessive fines, unreasonable fines; unreasonable procedures are in the common law court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2255.059" offset="9123610">We do really believe that this is the most persuasive of all our points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.948" offset="9143150">We cannot see that now when the employer may deny work to every member of the union and every employee as a bargaining device.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.060" offset="9179617">As a bargaining device it can fairly be deemed the Congress -- for Congress at the same time to have said in the statute that unions may not even with respect to their own members enforce a concerted work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.635" offset="9233951">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.980" offset="9235310">We would say, should the employer be able at his option to enforce -- to deny work to all of the workers in the plant as a bargaining device to chastise the union, but now the union without Congress ever having expressly said so is to be denied the right to have an effective concerted strike even by its own members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.321" offset="9304691">We say as this Court said in Curtis Brothers in the last sentence of Mr. Justice Brennan's opinion, the cardinal principle in construing the statute is we need a coherent national labor policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.338" offset="9348681">This should be a non-coherent national labor policy giving to the employer the traditional union weapon of the concerted strike and now taking it away from the union which you always had it, by the way that the employer has gained it fairly recently only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.552" offset="9405628">I want to say one last thing about the basic question before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.294" offset="9420570">In 1947, Congress was presented with a difficult choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.713" offset="9438229">The dual rigors of union allegiance and compulsory union membership were deemed by the Congress to go too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.788" offset="9466546">Congress had a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.257" offset="9472397">It could've gotten into the internal network of union allegiance and union norms and sought to deal with the problem there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.585" offset="9497684">It rejected that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.055" offset="9503640">Instead, in 1947 Congress said, "The part of this equation we will effect is compulsory union membership".</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.767" offset="9530389">What we're going to do henceforth is to knock out the close shop of any more compulsion than the payment of support moneys to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.132" offset="9559855">That's the choice that Congress made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.760" offset="9566438">Instead of interfering with the internal options of the union its solidarity and its strength in situations like the strike, what the Congress said was, "We'll start on this other side of the equation and we're going to say that compulsory unionism must go".</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.324" offset="9620668">Now, we say this is a delicate balance between four competing rights, the public's rights, the employer's rights, the union's rights and the individual workers rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.561" offset="9653582">That delicate balance cannot possibly, in our opinion, be upset by the meat cleaver which the majority of the Seventh Circuit employed on this sensitive question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.782" offset="9690467">It's a wholesale rewriting of the statute we say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.189" offset="9704155">Now, to squeeze into the 1947 statute rather than the Landrum-Griffin Act, which really dealt with the problem of union's relationship to its own members, to squeeze within the interest of this 1947 statute these rigorous limitations you may no longer have strike solidarity enforceable by a $20 or $100 fining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.831" offset="9782732">You can't go to Court to enforce your contract rights with your own members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.773" offset="9798510">This we say goes too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.096" offset="9803734">The right equation was the one that Congress struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.264" offset="9812407">Compulsory membership is barred but the union strength, solidarity and internal allegiance rules are left intact and enforceable until Congress acts, we say it is not for the Courts to upset that delicate balance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2655.710" offset="10726170">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.727" offset="10738291">I represent 23 individual employees of the New York Times who under circumstances similar to that involved in this case, were fined four weeks wages, in some cases as much as $1500 each, for having crossed the picket line, and in that sense violated the constitution and bylaws of the union to which they belong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.778" offset="10834526">I've been granted ten minutes to argue to the Court by Allis-Chalmers, and I want to take advantage of those ten minutes to reply to the arguments which have been made by the Solicitor General, which have been made by the union, to the effect that and I'm paraphrasing the words of the Solicitor General, the Section 7 rights do not exist here for these employees or employees in these circumstances because they have opted out of those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.013" offset="10951450">They have made a choice to submit themselves to union discipline and to the union requirements and consequently these statutory rights which Congress has enacted for them are set aside and put to naught.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.413" offset="11009024">Now, I think the point of departure has to be the source of the initial obligation or the initial impetuous to membership and that source is a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.049" offset="11071613">It is a collecting bargaining agreement which is entered into and which is negotiated by a corporate management on one hand and a union representative on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.888" offset="11114872">The individual employees, the man who has a crisis of conscience, the man who has an individual point of view is not sitting at that table when that bargain is reached, when that provision is included in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.503" offset="11169416">Now, some argument has been made that there is a difference in language in the Allis-Chalmers contract that perhaps the contract itself indicates a limitation on the type of membership which the man is obligated to submit himself to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.523" offset="11245484">This may or may not be, in point of fact, the record stipulates that all the employees involved became members pursuant to that clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.258" offset="11284355">The language itself talks in terms of becoming a member to the extent of -- of payment of dues and intiation fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.182" offset="11328136">And of course, in the New York Times situation and -- and in most situations in -- in industrial relations context, the clause is a much broader clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.568" offset="11365648">It's a typical union job provision which says you must become a member within 30 days of your employment of 30 days of the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="2907.967" offset="11735228">I think that is so, but again if we're to -- the -- the argument that I am trying to respond to is that there has been a voluntarily waiver of a statutory right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.862" offset="11778800">And I think when you try to evaluate that argument and decide whether there has in fact then a voluntary waiver, you have to look at the practicalities of the situation, what has in fact happened in this case whether there was a disclosure to the employee of what his alternatives were whether he did not receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.581" offset="11865736">And in this -- this is in fact the case here, and in fact the case in 99.9% of industrial relation situation, the employee gets a notice and he gets a card to get what's in the contract because he didn't negotiate that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.661" offset="11922056">He gets a card and it says, "You must join the union within 30 days, sign this card or you lose your job".</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.512" offset="11949432">Now, maybe he could go to his lawyer and say, "Well is this so and -- and how would I protect my rights and is there some other card I can sign and maybe there's some other way of doing it?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.001" offset="11995408">But I think we all recognize as a practical matter, number one is lawyers not likely to know, number two an employee who is working on an assembly -- assembly line and making $100 a week or $110 a week, is not going to have the time or the resources to solicit that kind of legal advice and to so carve out the restrictions and the reservations to his union membership, so that he's -- he's just confined it to the obligation to pay dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.088" offset="12123721">So he signs the card.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.093" offset="12131767">He signs the card which says, I apply for membership and then the union argues, in this case and then in the case that I'm handling in New York, he has assumed all the obligations of the constitution and bylaws of that union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.126" offset="12187878">He signed the card.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.285" offset="12192475">In point of fact in the Allis-Chalmers case, just as in our case with the New York Times, the employees did not get a copy of the constitution and bylaws until they were charged with the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.325" offset="12244720">When the charges came -- came to them and said, "You are being hold up on charges".</text>

            <text syncTime="3231.162" offset="13027976">Now, the union in its brief and I believe on its argument said that certainly if there -- if there was a threat for and I have it right here -- that by threatening them with physical harm or with the loss in employment benefits after the strike ended, the union would've violated Section 8 (b) (1) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.375" offset="13124838">This they concede would've been coercion and as a matter of fact under the circumstances they -- they concede that this would've been a violation of Section 8 (b) (1) (A).</text>

            <text syncTime="3567.196" offset="14372133">They may do so if authority of this type arises out of the membership relationship, and this is a question of common law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3586.741" offset="14450291">Now, the question whether in a particular instance the union may impose a fine which is the specific subject of discussion here would depend upon whether there is some other law forbidding it and that is the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.827" offset="14502640">And the question is would the imposition of such a fine violate the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.103" offset="14523747">The answer is no, because wildcat activity is not a Section 7 protected right and therefore Section 8 (b) (1) (A) which forbids coercions of the exercise of those rights simply does not apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="3652.239" offset="14712351">This is the only kind of activity which Section 7 concerns itself with at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.084" offset="14735757">In the House Bill, it was proposed that there'd be some references to the authority of unions in wildcat strike situations.</text>

            <text syncTime="4051.978" offset="16311254">The threat was of a fine for each offense of working during the progress of the strike and it was explicit in the threat that each day could constitute a separate such offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.904" offset="16366947">I think it's an elementary proposition that the scope of -- it is the scope of a threat which is relevant to coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.133" offset="16403937">Some employees did work during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="4079.428" offset="16421073">There has been some concentration on the relative proportion of those who did contrasted with those who did not.</text>

            <text syncTime="4144.796" offset="16682506">As I outlined in the case of the distinction between an unauthorized strike and the refraining from a strike which is authorized, the right that employees have is to refrain from certain activities, certain union activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4161.863" offset="16750843">If an employee were affirmatively to participate in a counter union activity, there might be some question whether this was or was not within protected right of the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.893" offset="16798908">I would say broadly that giving the widest reasonable scope to the protected right of free speech, and picketing being an expression, peaceful picketing being an expression of the right to free speech that there would certainly and should be wide latitude on the part of employees to express themselves as opposed to a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="4193.993" offset="16879365">As the Board has observed on many occasions, when an employer is sought to rely on the fact that employees did work during a strike as an indication of a loss of majority support, this is a normal and expectable sort of thing, and the Board, however, does not give it the credit that employers in some instances had sought to give it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.377" offset="16960867">The Board has said that this is merely a vote of no confidence in this particular strike activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4220.313" offset="16984586">It is not necessarily an indication of a desire not to continue being represented by that bargaining agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.673" offset="17014053">I think that this line of cases is particularly noticeable for the Board's recognition that there is by no means anything unusual or in its nature impermissible about employees working while a strike is in progress.</text>

            <text syncTime="4849.198" offset="19500178">Yet this Court in the General Motors Agency Shop case contrasted an agency shop agreement which requires only financial support, and as this Court's decision states leaves the option in the employee whether to apply for or not to apply for union membership with and as union shop agreement which in that case was identical in terms to that involved in the Allis-Chalmers contract which this Court's decision, I believe, quite correctly and patently from the nature of the statute leaves the option if indeed there is any in the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="4908.523" offset="19737475">But this Court's decision explicitly contrasts like the identical union shop provision that is involved in this case, the Allis-Chalmers within the agency shop, and yet the union in this case would argue that there is no distinction between them.</text>

            <text syncTime="5669.472" offset="22781262">Now, the fact is that it is virtually indisputable that it is a right for an employee to refrain from working during a strike, and the only question really remaining, indeed the Solicitor concedes this in -- in the brief for the Board, concedes this, and says that there is only one question really.</text>
            <text syncTime="5687.694" offset="22854196">Is the action of the union coercive in the meaning of the statute?</text>

            <text syncTime="5695.907" offset="22887006">In the Roberts and Skura line of cases in which the Board found 8 (b) (1) (A) unfair labor practices when unions impose fines against employees for exercising their protected right to resort to Board process stated that not only were fines within a co -- coercion, but they were in their nature coercion and it was plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="5718.781" offset="22978539">It was an indisputable fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5720.945" offset="22987107">Now, when all of these precedents are assembled the conclusion inevitably follows that -- that the imposition of a fine is coercion, and it is coercion directed specifically to an inherently employment matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="5764.113" offset="23159829">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5767.250" offset="23172368">I think there's one thing we should get straight on because there's so much that there's been argued that's not in the record, and for example this question of these men being dragooned into the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="5786.776" offset="23250526">We have in the appendix to our main brief, the opinion of the intermediary court in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="5796.995" offset="23291382">And I understand from Allis-Chalmers that that case is being completely and thoroughly litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5804.277" offset="23320430">And in that you'll see on page 41 of our brief the facts that show that this particular man, the test case on the question of not being able to get out of the union, and granting that you can only get out of the union in the last ten days of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="5826.987" offset="23411336">He was taken into the union in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="5832.269" offset="23432443">He could've left in 1956 or 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="5836.848" offset="23450728">And the strike both was made in August of 1958, and of all these things that are being charged that these members didn't know about, the Court of Appeals in Wisconsin found that he was present at the meeting where the strike vote was taken -- vote was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="5859.211" offset="23540172">And it was taken in August of 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="5861.315" offset="23548635">He could have gotten out December 21 of 1958, because the strike wasn't called until 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="5871.926" offset="23591058">So I think that I have to add that to the other points and bring about what we are not talking about, or rather what this case is not about.</text>
            <text syncTime="5886.932" offset="23651140">This is the Allis-Chalmers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5889.758" offset="23662425">It doesn't involve the high exorbitant fines on anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="5896.365" offset="23688861">Fines range from $20 to $100 per man.</text>
            <text syncTime="5900.203" offset="23704221">It doesn't involve freedom of speech, and it doesn't involve involuntary membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="5908.881" offset="23738911">There is not one word in this record to support any argument about involuntary membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="5917.878" offset="23774856">There is not one word that I've been able to find in this record that supports a statement that the man never even got a constitution of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="5928.408" offset="23816965">I don't know where that comes from maybe it's in one of the other records.</text>
            <text syncTime="5932.890" offset="23834937">But he did attend the strike meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5935.415" offset="23845073">Now, I say there's nothing in this record as to any of the other men except the stipulation that they were all union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="5947.717" offset="23894288">And finally, I would like to make it clear because so much adversary seems to say that the National Labor Relations Board takes the position about 7, we don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="5961.831" offset="23950712">We think 7 is a part of 8 and we take the position you don't have to get to 7 or the proviso in order to uphold the Board in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5973.217" offset="23996270">We rely of course on 8 and we view 7 as a part of the 8 provision.</text>
