            <text syncTime="3983.627" offset="16037909">With respect to the entire electoral process that went on in Georgia, it's very difficult of course in any case of this type to make a record as to what voters intend in any election contest case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.574" offset="16089631">It's always difficult to say that a certain number of voters would have voted another way or did vote another way because that sort of proceeding is always open to perjury as to what people say their intentions were and what they were going to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.463" offset="16137174">We've tried to take the case of Davis versus Schnell and to utilize some of the techniques there used to show the intention of the legislature and the electorate regarding this general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.801" offset="16190568">Now it's our contention generally that the election was held under the provisions of the Georgia Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.130" offset="16231842">And the Attorney General of Georgia issued an Attorney General's opinion were not the supporters of Mr. Callaway and not the supporters of Mr. Maddox but the supporters as to the Write-in Movement went to the Secretary of State and said, “Look, we think that we can have a runoff from this election and that's what we want.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.282" offset="16304462">And at that point, the Attorney General of Georgia issued an official opinion saying that the runoff statute did not jive with the Constitution of Georgia and they couldn't have a runoff election.</text>
            <text syncTime="4061.442" offset="16349184">Now from that point on, there'd became a great misleading of the electorate of Georgia and that misleading was not a venal misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.856" offset="16382830">It wasn't done by the candidates deliberately or the press deliberately, by the Attorney General Georgia deliberately, it's just the State Constitution conflicted with the state's statute his interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4080.348" offset="16424730">He said, “State Constitution would prevail and this election would go to the state legislature.” Now, what would be the effect of that?</text>
            <text syncTime="4086.740" offset="16450330">Well, I think its common knowledge that in politics you often have the argument or question with respect to the lesser of two evils.</text>
            <text syncTime="4096.272" offset="16488469">This candidate is the less of -- lesser in two evils in every state and in every national election.I'm sure that argument is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.648" offset="16513964">But in thiselection it went further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.430" offset="16525040">It was commonly argued in the State of Georgia that in the event that you vote for a write-in candidate whether with Mr. Arnall or anybody else, you thereby contribute to the election of Mr. Maddox because when you do that, if there's no majority, it will go the General Assembly and there Mr. Maddox will get a second chance based upon the oath that was already taken in the Democratic predominance in the General Assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4129.955" offset="16623156">Now, this had an effect on that election which was such as to render the November 8th proceeding invalid and void and to constitute a total failure of election because -- due to the misleading that election could not be a proper election for nominating the two candidates who either the legislature could select or the people of Georgia could vote on at a later time.</text>

            <text syncTime="4311.479" offset="17349256">Now, most of the cases that I have read with respect to this right arose at the time the Australian ballot was being adopted in this country or seemed to have risen about that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4320.140" offset="17383946">And this right to cast a write-in ballot is the right of a voter to reject the nominees trust upon him by the major parties or by any other nominating process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.713" offset="17430235">Now, repeatedly throughout the history of this country, we've had recurrent efforts to bar minority groups in the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.690" offset="17466180">Now, we have laws all across the country that provides certain requirements for a group to come to the floor to get on the ballot via percent of the vote in the last election, 10% whatever it may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.731" offset="17514245">Now, the right to vote is the most personal right a man has.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.790" offset="17534516">I know in Harper versus Virginia State Board of Election this Court stated that it didn't reach the question of the relationship between the right to vote and the right of free expression and then went ahead to decide the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4370.078" offset="17583731">Well in this instance, we obviously have voters in Georgia and I'm not just contending there's been a misleading of just the people who voted for the write-in thicket or just the ons who voted for the Callaway thicket or just the ones who go to the Maddox thicket.</text>

            <text syncTime="4876.184" offset="19608116">Since that time because of the expedition in which this case is handled ourselves representing justice et al and the state have joined in a stipulation which has been presented to clerk's office in which we have obtained on the basis of telegram request from this ordinaries what these returns showed based on the statutory records and they have notified us and from all the counties, a 148 counties of the 159.</text>

            <text syncTime="6523.111" offset="26195780">And nobody in a party convention has a right to an equal vote or equal representation depending on where they live.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6530.537" offset="26225560">So, since Georgia could have chosen that method initially it did not have to permit nomination by a primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="6536.742" offset="26250324">It was perfectly alright to do this in the Democratic primary election.</text>
