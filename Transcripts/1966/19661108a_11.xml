            <label>Mr. Charles B. Myers</label>
            <text syncTime="30.924" offset="227035">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.608" offset="241768">The question in this case is, to what extent does the Interstate Commerce Commission have jurisdiction to make an award of reparation to a shipper, who has been required to pay unreasonably high joint through international rates on its traffic from points in the United States to points of Canada?</text>
            <text syncTime="55.155" offset="324002">This case had its origin in an informal complaint which we filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.678" offset="362036">That complaint alleged that the international through rates from Carlsbad and Loving, New Mexico to our plants at Toronto in Welland and Ontario Province and in -- at Montreal in Quebec Province, and at Saint John in Brunswick were unreasonable and we prayed for reparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.932" offset="459107">Now, the shipments in question moved during the period of January 5 to May 5, 1948 and over the lines of the respondent railroads and two Canadian railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.011" offset="519398">It was during this period that the railroads had assessed at 20% increase in all their rates on potash.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.478" offset="561298">And that increase was only an emergency increase authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.240" offset="584286">The Commission later determined effective May 6, that the maximum increase on such shipments should be 20% but in no case more than $1.60 a ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.229" offset="648338">Now, perhaps I can illustrate what's involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.561" offset="661608">The basic rate from Carlsbad to Toronto was $12.20 a ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.762" offset="682402">When that rate was increased by the temporary increased of 20%, it went up to $14.64.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.513" offset="713435">When the Commission decided what the maximum permit increase was with $1.60 a ton that rate on May 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.999" offset="747395">It came a $13.80 a ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.312" offset="756590">Our complaint before the Commission asked that we be awarded reparation for the difference between the $14.64 and the $13.80.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.243" offset="804342">Now, that same proposition was pending in number of cases before the Commission on potash and public commodities as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.637" offset="837883">One of those cases was Consolidated Rendering versus the Santa Fe Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.891" offset="866931">The Commission decided that Consolidated Rendering case in 1957 and among the destinations involved in that case, destination of potash were car of -- I think this is also from Loving and Carlsbad New Mexico and the destinations involved included Detroit and Port Huron, Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.912" offset="963062">Now those two points are border points through which all of our traffic moved in route to Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.163" offset="995976">The Commission held there as we had hope they would in our case that the shippers were entitled to reparation or the increase rates exceeded the basic rates plus $1.60 a ton and they awarded reparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.092" offset="1071731">Now, the railroads refused to satisfy our informal complaint and that required us to bring the form of complaint with the Commission in which we made the same allegations as we did in the informal pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.237" offset="1140276">After hearing, the Commission decided in our case as it did in the Consolidated Rendering case and awarded us reparation for the entire difference between the joint through international rates which bore the 20% increase and what would have been reasonable joint through international rates increased by the $1.60 a ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.093" offset="1239751">The respondents refused to pay all of that award.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.680" offset="1254066">They paid us $5,300.00 but decline us -- decline to pay us the remaining $1,400.00 on the ground that that represented freight charges for transportation in Canada and that was beyond the Commission's jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="355.098" offset="1523754">The railroads appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and that court reversed the District Court, we're here in certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.730" offset="1570252">It is our basic position in this case that the Commission was correct in awarding for reparation and then in doing it, all it was doing was invoking the jurisdiction that its exercise consistently in these cases for the last 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.099" offset="1651754">The Commission's decision in this nature go back to 1910, consistently holding that where a shipper has paid an excessive joint through international rates is entitled to full reparation for his damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="415.960" offset="1767215">We say that the jurisdiction of the Commission was challenged here in News Syndicate versus New York Central case reported at 275 U.S. 179 and subsequently, in New York decision in the Lewis-Simas-Jones versus Southern Pacific Company in 283 U.S. 654.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.638" offset="1857912">Now the respondents have no argument with us that these two cases stand for the proposition that is a shipper isn't entitled to full reparation where he is in required to pay excessive joint through international rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.555" offset="1929592">But they say that these cases are not controlling here because the situation in those cases, the record in those cases did not reveal as this record does a maximum reasonable rate from Carlsbad and in Loving to the border trustees that is for the American portion of the free transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.144" offset="2039933">They argue that since the Commission had prescribed in the Consolidated Rendering case, what was the maximum reasonable rate for that American portion of the whole that the Commissions without jurisdiction to award anything more than what it awarded to Detroit in Court hereon in the Consolidated Rendering case.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.980" offset="2127287">We of course take very rigorous exception to that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles B. Myers</label>
            <text syncTime="522.078" offset="2191653">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.972" offset="2195310">And as I'll develop in a moment Mr. Chief Justice, we have no alternative but to pay through rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.346" offset="2224776">The Commission's jurisdiction over rail transportation is defined in Section 1 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.562" offset="2257586">And that Section reproduced in the first page of our appendix to our brief and it starts out with paragraph with the heading, Carrier Subject to Regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.982" offset="2311293">The provisions of this chapter shall apply to common carriers engaged in the transportation, and skipping over a little bit here, of properly wholly by railroad and then dropping down to the third line from the bottom of that paragraph, from or to any place in the United States, to or from a foreign country and with this proviso but only insofar such transportation takes place within the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.877" offset="2434905">Now, we have an addition to the petitioner and the respondent railroad to amicus curiae participations, one by the United States represented by the Solicitor General, one by the Interstate Commerce Commission represented by Mr. Goodman.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.575" offset="2517661">So the Solicitor General's position in these proceeding that because of the proviso limiting the transportation only insofar as it takes place within the United States is that the Commission has no power over a rate in a foreign country and consequently it has no power for reparation or other purposes to determine what is a portion of a joint -- a reasonable portion of a joint through international rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.651" offset="2661961">They take a similar position with respect to a combination of proportional rates to and from the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.643" offset="2685994">Now that situation is not involved in our ca -- in our review of the lower court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.391" offset="2724968">As a consequence, the Solicitor General is asking this Court to overrule its decision in News Syndicate and in Lewis and with respect to the Court proportional rates in your decision in Great Northern versus Sullivan 294 U.S. 458.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.040" offset="2807515">He would also if he prevails reverse 50 years of Interstate Commerce Commission precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.996" offset="2843355">As I mentioned earlier, the Commissions here and it's going to participate in response to the views of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.386" offset="2872926">I'll confine my presentation to answering the respondents and dealing with the lower court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.652" offset="2910020">There is one very important point which I think we would -- should establish before we get into a discussion of the News Syndicate and Lewis cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.339" offset="2948681">And that is that the joint through international rates which were assessed on our shipments where the rates legally applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.520" offset="2989432">We have no quarrel with the respondents over that.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.988" offset="2999359">They stipulated that this is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.389" offset="3008972">And this is important because this Court is frequently held that there can only be one legal rate on a given ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.157" offset="3043976">Now it's our position that if once we were assessed, the legal rate that is the joint through international rate, there was no other rate which could have applied to those -- to that transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.340" offset="3100714">Not the rates from Loving and Carlsbad to Detroit before hereon.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.049" offset="3123597">Not the rates to Buffalo or to any other gateway but only the international rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.411" offset="3148988">And we say that's the whole point of this case, the applicability of rates and what we were required to pay and what our measure of damages should be.</text>

            <text syncTime="1308.895" offset="5338990">Here again, only the American carrier was sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.712" offset="5354245">Now, the action was brought in state courts as opposed in federal courts but the railroads had also maintained that local rate from the border crossing to San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.771" offset="5406490">And it was there contention that having published that rate, having it in existence excused them from any violation of Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.130" offset="5451943">They said that they had complied with their obligation under the Act by publishing such rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.494" offset="5481305">The state court and the appellate courts state agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.731" offset="5502307">This Court disagreed and said that the News Syndicate case was controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.556" offset="5529579">And in the course of that decision, Court pointed out that the local rate and the border crossing to San Francisco didn't apply on the transportation and that the shipper was damaged by the joint through international rate which the Commission found was excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.845" offset="5606797">And that the shipper was entitled to reparation here respective of how the carriers divided their revenues in here respective of any portion of the revenue that was in the foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.599" offset="5673775">The underlying basis of the Lewis case was that the collection of an excessive rate is a tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.504" offset="5709406">And since the rate was joint, the tort was joint and the carriers were jointly and severally liable as joint tortfeasors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.077" offset="5763636">This is a position which the Commission has consistently followed and follows to this day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.437" offset="5797073">Now in the two cases that is News Syndicate and Lewis in our case, the joint through international rates were the only rates that applied which means that none other was couldn't been applied to us and we think that all three cases are comfortable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.233" offset="5896338">Now, the respondents argue that there obligation under the Act have been satisfied by the fact that the Commission had prescribed and Consolidated Rendering the maximum reasonable rate from Carlsbad and Loving to these two border points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.053" offset="5959555">We say that that's immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.594" offset="5973765">The Railroads didn't assess us on that rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.004" offset="5987349">They made us pay the through rates and we don't think our damages can be measured in some fashion except by that relation to what would be a reasonable joint through international rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.276" offset="6052446">The Court of Appeals agreed with the Railroads and if said that the Railroad had met their burden of establishing the rates from the New Mexico origins to the border points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.496" offset="6117334">We say that situation, that holding is the same as the state courts made in the Lewis case which respect to the local rate from the Arizona border to San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.649" offset="6182013">This Court held that that rate had no application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.756" offset="6210435">Now, if what the Court of Appeals and what the respondents argue is correct then we have a situation where railroads operating within the United States are going to have full freedom to establish any level of international rates that they want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.730" offset="6310327">In other words, under the Court of Appeals decision, as long as there is an existence a reasonable rate, to or from the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.174" offset="6356093">That satisfies the respondent's obligation under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.088" offset="6375737">We say that's wrong because if that were the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.104" offset="6395800">The Commission would have no jurisdiction, no control over excessive joint through international rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.945" offset="6435192">The shipper would have no right to complaint as to the through rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.844" offset="6454732">It might be two or three times what the rate should be or it might be destructively low.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.621" offset="6485870">But as long as it was joint rate and the carrier had also kept in effect a rate to or from the boundary that is between points in United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.751" offset="6530382">The Commission would be powerless to do anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.872" offset="6542817">Now, we don't think that that was Section 1 of the Act means and we don't think that Congress intended to render this Commission powerless in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.869" offset="6590882">We think that the judgment of the Court of Appeals was erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.266" offset="6608436">I think it should be reversed and the judgment of the District Court reinstate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1665.589" offset="6765693">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.565" offset="6781680">I'm here representing the nine American Railroads which participated in this through international shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.182" offset="6812087">And in order to put our decision into proper perspective, I want to discuss first precisely in dollars and cents fashion what the Commission has done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.821" offset="6862660">Mr. Myers has discussed the decision in the Commission in the Consolidated Rendering case in which rates of potash were found unreasonable and reparation of origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.778" offset="6922533">The theory the Commission and the Consolidated Rendering case was that a temporary authorized rate increase of 20% was excessive to the extent that it exceeded a subsequently authorized maximum increase of a $1.60 a ton, to give an example the exactly how that works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.624" offset="7013857">The rate charge during this period the first five months of 1948 on potash from Carlsbad to Detroit, Michigan, excuse me, the basic rate before the increases are applied is $11.10.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.556" offset="7081566">During these five months period, the 20% temporary increase supplied to that that came to $2.22.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.979" offset="7115316">Then when the Commission decided that they would throw out all of these temporary increases above the $1.60 a ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.384" offset="7152933">That meant that the rate to Detroit was excessive by the difference of $0.62 a ton and so, the commissioner awarded reparation in the Consolidated Rendering case on the Detroit shipments in the amount of $.062 a ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.816" offset="7214686">Now when we come to the Canada Packers case, that case had been held and obeyed inspite the Commission pending the outcome of a Consolidated Rendering case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.227" offset="7260244">And the Canada Packers case was based upon the Consolidated Rendering case and precisely the same formula was applied to determine unreasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.379" offset="7308936">In order words, the difference between the 20% increase and a final maximum increase with the $1.60 a ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.220" offset="7356270">For example, to Toronto, this meant that the basic rate which has been increased from $12.20 by 20% rose to 14.64 during the period these shipments moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.795" offset="7418546">Any shipments move during the precise period of time as the shipment in the Consolidated Rendering case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.920" offset="7447071">From this now, let's open the origin as the same commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.595" offset="7461804">And all of these shipments went through Detroit for herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.742" offset="7478314">I used Detroit as an example because the same rate applied through both of the border crossing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.710" offset="7514258">So when the Commission applied this formula to this Canadian shipments because the formula has a, you might say a built bias against the higher rated shipments for the longer distances, you come up with the finding that the rates in Toronto were excessive by $0.84 a ton whereas the rates to Detroit were excessive by $.062 a ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.471" offset="7617285">The only difference between the shipments to Detroit and a shipment to Toronto was an additional transportation it was performed entirely within Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.853" offset="7658768">It's even more interesting to see what the Commission did by applying this arbitrarily on a shipment that went from Carlsbad through Detroit to Toronto beyond Montreal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.307" offset="7720626">Thereby applying the same formula, you come up with an excess of a $1.28 a ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.932" offset="7747062">More than twice the measure of unreasonableness of the Detroit rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.212" offset="7768168">We go all the way to Saint John to Brunswick.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.488" offset="7781334">You come up with an excess of a $1.80 per ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.458" offset="7801187">I should mention the Saint John situation is under little unusual because this shipments reentered United States for a short distance across northern portion of the State of Maine because the aiding pacific take a shortcut across there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.807" offset="7866598">Now, Mr. Justice Brennan wanted to know exactly what the railroads did in complying with the reparation or what was entered here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.037" offset="7919470">The order itself here's on pages 19 and 21 of the record that contains in it some qualifying language in two places that it applies only insofar as the transportation took place within United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.936" offset="7999091">So when the claim for this reparation totaling over $6,600.00 of total transportation charges of some what over $100,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.167" offset="8047992">There are 131 shipments involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.887" offset="8062934">When that claim for the $6,600.00 was presented to the auditor of the freight accounts of one of the American railroads, which was the origin carrier with the claim for payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.522" offset="8117478">He computed -- recomputed the award by deducting a division representing the share of the Canadian railroads for each of this particular shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.538" offset="8169514">Now those division vary -- divisions vary the percentages depending upon what the destination in Canada is and they even vary depending upon which particular railroads in the United States participated in the movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.833" offset="8234715">But on a weighted average basis, the division of the Canadian railroads comes to slightly less from 21% and that is how we computed the figure of $1,390.00 for which the -- this suit was brought.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harvey Huston</label>
            <text syncTime="2080.971" offset="8427290">The -- in other words, the revenue was divided 21% to the Canadian railroad, 79% to the American.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.981" offset="8451323">Therefore the reparation award was divided in the same manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.784" offset="8466474">So the American railroads paid out 79% and said that's all we're going to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.589" offset="8501687">Now when the suit was brought in the federal courts, we defended on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.928" offset="8527078">The first ground was the fact that the language in the reparation order specifically carried these restrictions where the limitations to apply of transportation performed within the United States and we defended on the ground that the order was it best ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.574" offset="8605654">If you can look at the dollar amounts in the reparation order, you can see that the Commission applied the same formula as it had done on domestic shipments that saw the (Inaudible) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.533" offset="8653511">But we took the position that the order was ambiguous and that even on the old terms of the Commission's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.721" offset="8682245">We had it right to make this deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.793" offset="8694575">That point was discussed in the opinion of the Court of Appeals but it was not specifically resolved one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.497" offset="8725400">So our alternative defense those that assuming the dollar amounts in the Commission's award take precedents over this limiting language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.191" offset="8776182">In other words, ignore the limiting language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.684" offset="8794154">Then you come up quite frankly against the Lewis case which -- on which the petitioner relies so heavily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.201" offset="8828217">The Lewis case is an extension of the News Syndicate case and they held there that even if there was shown the existence of a domestic rate covering the domestic portion of a few transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.366" offset="8908884">That alone was not enough to bring it out from underneath the rule of the Lewis case so as to restrict the payment of repara -- the award of reparation to something other then representing the complete transportation -- complete international transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.944" offset="8979101">Now the Lewis case, the Court hold attention to that that when a defendant filed his answer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3099.248" offset="12500407">The Solicitor General has suggested also that possibly the -- that maximum reasonable rate to Detroit might not be appropriate as a proportion because of the fact that presumably the rate to Detroit included a factor for the terminal services involved at Detroit and that might not be appropriate for a shipment going beyond Detroit determinating at Toronto.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.670" offset="12606046">I think this is not a matter of great moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.747" offset="12622346">The Commission in the Consolidated Rendering case in discussing this potash traffic from Carlsbad made a specific comment that terminal operations on this traffic are relatively simply.</text>

            <text syncTime="3164.958" offset="12763199">I think the enforcement of the or rather I think the restrictions upon the Commission's reparation of award would then determine to the appropriate by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.548" offset="12813563">I think have a great deal of merit because if you don't agree with that conclusion, in effect you're telling the Commission that, it's alright to the domestic portion to find that rates where excessive by $0.62 a ton, if you're only going to Detroit but by $0.84 a ton, a$1.28 a ton or $1.80 a ton depending on how far you go into Canada.</text>

            <text syncTime="3291.734" offset="13270288">Well, I think there is that element -- there is that obstacle here but I must say that in all three of the decisions, they are all suggestions as to mean through which the railroad can avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.447" offset="13329115">It's my ability for the entire trip suggestions which we cannot fully understand because one of them is not consistent with position taken by the Interstate Commerce Commission and a position as to which all counsel here are agreed that is that seems to be a suggestion that, if only the railroad had published an alternative rate to the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.356" offset="13440815">Then it would not have been liable for the entire reparation due on the joint through rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.186" offset="13468087">Yet, this Court has held and the Commission has consistently held that there can only be one rate available to a particular shipper or a particular shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.731" offset="13510301">Therefore that alternative doesn't seem to us to be a real one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.872" offset="13526810">Now, since that is part of the premise of these decisions, it is difficult to follow the decisions get through of any of that and that may give less reluctance in qualifying them or overturning them at this great day.</text>

            <text syncTime="3420.438" offset="13785109">Our answer is that it would impose no additional duty whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.859" offset="13802768">Instead of finding a reasonable international joint though rate which the Commission had done in this case and would under its practice do in every such case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.661" offset="13846026">It would instead not in addition but instead find the maximum reasonable proportional rate to the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.506" offset="13881448">A thing which it would seem to us to be an easier operations since we're dealing with the familiar American carriers, familiar American cars, familiar American territory and not looking somewhat blindly over the border in Canada which is necessary aspect to determine in the total reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.475" offset="13973295">So there is no problem of imposing additional burden on the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.608" offset="14001821">I should say perhaps also at the outset that we could not agree with the respondents -- there attempt to distinguished these three decisions of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.088" offset="14059708">Because we have the same difficulty that I think it was voice by Mr. Justice Fortas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.230" offset="14080293">We cannot see really what difference it makes if there is an additional rate published to the border, especially, if that additional rate to the border is not available to this particular shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.679" offset="14138075">If he's compelled where there is a joint through rate to ship to pay that charge then its more comfort to the shipper that there is another rate which that can give that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.845" offset="14202755">It is true that the Commission's finding as to this other rate if it has been done independently in a prior proceeding, may furnish evidence of what that portion of the trip, what charge should be meet to that portion of the trip.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.323" offset="14280704">And to that extent, here the carrier cannot be taxed with having failed to enlighten the Commission as to an alternative way of computing reparations because the Commission itself perhaps if this Consolidated Rendering case is appropriate -- it is an appropriate then had already found on its own such a standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.441" offset="14385089">And therefore there is no need for the carrier to make that choice to the extent that those early decisions of this Court rest on a default of the carrier that show the Commission, how else to go about accessing reparations, this may be a distinguishable case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.817" offset="14458650">However as we say, it seems to us that in every case the maximum allowable reparation is with respect to the American portion of the trip.</text>
