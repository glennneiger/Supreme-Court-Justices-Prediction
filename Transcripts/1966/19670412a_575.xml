            <text syncTime="356.550" offset="1529605">We've been thrown out right at the very beginning stating that we have no right of action, no cause of action for a claim under the Jones Act, for a claim under General Maritime Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.398" offset="1568998">I'm not going to bring up Louisiana Tort Law because that's not the basis for this appeal or I won't bring up Louisiana Workmen's Comp, that's not basis of this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.627" offset="1609853">I would just confine myself to the Jones Act and to General Maritime Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.255" offset="1636394">Before -- Judge Carey in the Civil District Court, it was urged that whether or not Luther Jackson was a member of the crew, is a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.558" offset="1677563">It's a question of fact for the jury to decide, that he had no authority to make that decision which based on the various cases that you don't take the mere name that this is a Longshoremen Act, he is a longshoreman than he's automatically as matter of law within the scope of the Longshoreman Act just like a railroad employee, if he was a brakeman, he isn't automatically within the scope of FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.074" offset="1767633">He may come under the Longshoremen Act if he's over navigable waters and he may be a member of the crew if he has aboard a vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.976" offset="1803264">I contented before Judge Carey that it was a question of fact for the jury to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.250" offset="1828342">And he felt that was a matter of absolute law that he couldn't be a member of the crew, that he had to be a longshoreman within the scope of the Longshoremen's Harbor Workers' Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.953" offset="1875153">My second argument to Judge Carey was that conceding -- that you assumed he's a member -- that he cannot be a member of the crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.783" offset="1918516">Then, I have a General Maritime Law claim for my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.322" offset="1940668">And he has a claim based on the warrant of seaworthi -- seaworthiness pursuant to Reed versus Yaka.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.637" offset="1969925">His position was that Section 905 of the Longshoremen Harbor Worker Act precluded any claim whatsoever against Lykes Brothers on the General Maritime Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.042" offset="2027499">His position was that this was the same problem that he had handled in Ellis versus Travelers and in Stepter versus T. Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.905" offset="2063026">If you go back to the Robinson case, you'll find that there is a quote of at least one of those cases in the Robinson versus Lykes case.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.594" offset="2093746">And he based his decision on the Robinson versus Lykes decision that the only remedy that the weather had was pursuant to Longshoremen Harbor Workers' Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.497" offset="2149334">My position to the judge was, that he was making in the determination under the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act that this particular employee was an employee within the meaning of the Act and that he was making the determination as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.403" offset="2216939">He couldn't be a seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.952" offset="2223208">He was making the determination as a matter of law that he had to be a longshoreman and even though he was making this determination, he was excluding the ruling or the holding at least to the spirit of Reed versus Yaka.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.482" offset="2281305">Well, I lost in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.830" offset="2286738">So we went up to Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.789" offset="2298546">All these same points were urged and that under the Jones Act, it was a question of fact for the jury to determine that it would not be as a matter of law he was a longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.090" offset="2367718">It had -- it was a question of fact that had to be determined by the Deputy Commissioner, since the Deputy Commissioner had made no determination it was moot.</text>

            <text syncTime="1618.908" offset="6578970">Precisely, that is the (Voice Overlap) exact point of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.409" offset="6597047">Now, I don't want to launch into any extended history but as Your Honors know, this whole thing flows from the Jensen case where in 1917 a longshoreman employed as in this case by the ship owner, they attempted to avail himself if he was killed incidentally, his widow attempting to avail herself of the New York Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.786" offset="6754513">And in Jensen, this Court held that the uniformity of the maritime law required rather prevented the application of individual Compensation Acts of the various states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.627" offset="6805922">After two efforts by Congress to relegate the questions of the states, this Court in the Grand Smith case strongly headed to Congress to the thing they do for longshoreman was to pass a Longshoremen's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.139" offset="6855973">Congress did not act immediately but in 1926, this Court held in the Haverty case that a longshoreman was a seaman as against his employer and was entitled to the rights under the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.335" offset="6912711">Congress then and there in 1927 passed the Longshoremen's Act to correct the decision of the Haverty case and to give longshoreman the very character of employee which we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.228" offset="6964328">Give the longshoreman a carefully thought out compensation plan that has been held constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.305" offset="6996616">And it's been the subject of some litigation in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.373" offset="7028903">The Longshoremen's Act covers two situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.151" offset="7051995">It carefully preserves the injured employee's rights against their bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.867" offset="7086791">And as against the employer, it makes the provisions of the Act exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.195" offset="7112182">Exclusive of all other liability whether in admirality or at law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.313" offset="7132662">Now, in Sieracki, this Court held that the longshoreman injured by unseaworthiness of a third party's vessel had the same warranty of seaworthiness as a seaman had and could recover damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.879" offset="7194937">Then Ryan comes along and Ryan recovers from the steamship owner a typical third party situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.153" offset="7227956">And the ship owner impleads the stevedore employer because the stevedore's negligence had brought about the unseaworthy condition which had cast the ship owner in damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.639" offset="7285948">The majority of the Court held in Ryan that there was an implied warranty of workmanlike performance running between the stevedore employer on the one hand and the ship owner on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.686" offset="7354075">It was a strong defense and the principal thing which concerned the dissenters was that this implied indemnity which the Court found running between the stevedore employer and the ship owner warranty of workmanlike performance was a violation of Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.527" offset="7461491">Then comes Yaka, in fact that's why we're here, Yaka.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.824" offset="7482702">Yaka was a suite by a longshoreman against a vessel in rem, vessel not owned by his employer but bareboat chartered to his employer under a bareboat charter which contained and expressed indemnity of the charterer and of the ship owner by the charterer for anything arising in the operation of the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.535" offset="7605478">It had been emphasized in the dissent in Ryan that if there had been an expressed indemnity in Ryan, the dissenters would have gone along with the majority with what the dissenters objected to, was this implying of a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.125" offset="7679875">Now, in the District Court in Yaka, there was a decree in rem against the shipment and there was a decree over against the bareboat charterer's stevedore employer under the express indemnity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.800" offset="7762526">When that case got to the Third Circuit the arguments went allover the place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.389" offset="7792933">When the case came to this Court although the indemnity, the real basis on which the case was decided, the indemnity was mentioned, it was more or less lost cite of and the case was decided in this Court on more general grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.205" offset="7876211">But there is absolutely nothing in Yaka and I want to say this as strongly and as sincerely as I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.313" offset="7908603">There is absolutely nothing in the facts of Yaka which justify this longshoreman's widow suing her decedent employer direct in the face of that exclusive provisions of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. Benjamin W. Yancey</label>
            <text syncTime="2035.528" offset="8245478">That is a case of a Babin, B-A-B-I-N versus Lykes the citation of which I do not have but I can get for you if you want in the Court of Appeals for the Parish of Orleans -- the Court of Appeals for the Parish of Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.596" offset="8321755">This position of that point in this Court is that the Louisiana courts have not in fact passed upon that question and under Tungus, it is their province to pass upon it and in this particular litigation they didn't reach it because they felt that the exclusive provisions of the Section 5 bother from going any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.953" offset="8415169">Now, I want to say in a few words that if the position of my friend is maintained in this Court that Section 5 of the Longshoreman's Act doesn't mean what it says and that a longshoreman is free to sue his ship owner, operator, stevedore employer for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.469" offset="8537213">And of course the constitutionality of the Act is immediately cast into doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.122" offset="8559888">The basis on which the Longshoremen's Act, all Compensation Acts have been held to be constitutional is the quid pro quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.061" offset="8595623">The employer gives up defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.590" offset="8609729">The employer is liable without fault for stated amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.626" offset="8641912">The employee gives up the right to sue but he in return back, he gets a fix amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.981" offset="8675244">In other words as the courts have said many, many times it was a quid pro quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.407" offset="8700949">And with no intention to be anything but deadly serious, what my friend is suggesting here is that Congress having given him the quid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.091" offset="8735744">Now, this case should -- this Court should give him the quo, and leave the employer with absolutely nothing under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.378" offset="8772838">And aside from the unconstitutionality of this position, I'm impressed by the fact that the position makes absolutely meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.269" offset="8824456">The third party provisions contained in Section 33 of the Act, Congress envisioned -- envisaged the right to sue a third party and preserving that provided that if the employer pursues that right against the third party, the employer must account to the employee for anything over the recovery after reasonable attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.649" offset="8933961">If the employee pursues the rights against the third party then if he settles without the employer's permission, in other words, protecting the employer's right in the suit against the third party then, the right to further compensation is lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.643" offset="9021942">Now, of course this position makes hash of those provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.798" offset="9038555">We can't sue ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.891" offset="9046915">The position really is that we are liable without fault under the Longshoremen's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.237" offset="9088293">We are liable without fault for unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.650" offset="9101981">We are liable with fault for negligence and incidentally I reiterate this suite is based on negligence and we are liable under the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.880" offset="9146911">Of course, if the Court please, that the -- well, my real point is that the Longshoreman and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act is as between employer and employee exclusive and incidentally but a congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.720" offset="9234265">Before I sit down, there've been one or two remarks in decisions by this Court about congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.559" offset="9269582">In 1959, I mentioned that it in the brief, after this Court had decided Sieracki, after this Court had decided Ryan, the provisions of Section 33 for the third party practice were amended and liberalized and in the Senate report with the whole background to Sieracki and Ryan before it, in the Senate report, the reporters reiterate the exclusive feature of the Longshoremen's Act as between employer and employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.785" offset="9446484">One final word, there's an effort to split our personality into ship owner, stevedore employer that if the Court please in my humble judgment won't wash.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.544" offset="9505520">When the Longshoremen's Act was passed in 1927, it was known, as Jensen explained, it was known that many ship owners did their own stevedoring, so that the Longshoremen's Act was passed in 1927 with this situation in focus.</text>
