            <text syncTime="78.175" offset="417081">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.110" offset="440801">We will divide the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.505" offset="446443">Accordingly, I will handle the Equal Protection argument as we view it and Mr. Cohen will argue the Due Process argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.327" offset="477686">You have before you today what we consider the most odious of the segregation laws and the slavery laws and our view of this law, we hope to clearly show is that this is a slavery law.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.125" offset="524915">We referred to the law itself -- oh at first, I'd like to bring the Court's attention, there are some discrepancy in the briefs between us and the common law especially as to which laws are in essence.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.350" offset="569846">They have particularly said that Section 20-58 and 20-59 of the Virginia Code are the only things for consideration by this Court, and those two Sections, of course, are the criminal section, making a criminal penalty for Negro and white to intermarry in the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.220" offset="645287">20-58 is the evasion section under which this case particularly arose which makes it a criminal act to people who go outside the State to avoid the laws of Virginia to get married.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.151" offset="697010">We contend, however, Your Honors that there is much more in essence here.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.356" offset="713832">That there's actually one simple issue, and the issue is, may a State proscribe a marriage between two adult consenting individuals because of their race and this would take in much more in the Virginia statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.513" offset="766495">Sections 20-54 and 20-57 void such marriages and if they void such marriages, you would only decide on 20-58 and 20-59, these people, whether they go back to Virginia and they are in Virginia now, will be subject to immediate arrest under the fornest -- fornication statute, and the lewd and lascivious cohabitation statute and more than that, there are many, many other problems with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.521" offset="862521">Their children would be declared bastards under many Virginia decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.043" offset="880598">They themselves would lose their rights for insurance, social security and numerous other things to which they're entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.074" offset="912677">So we strongly urge the Court considering this to consider this basic question, may the state proscribe a marriage between such individuals because of their race and their race alone.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip J. Hirschkop</label>
            <text syncTime="215.306" offset="965653">There are 16 states, Your Honors that have these States.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.494" offset="974326">Presently, Maryland just repealed theirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.138" offset="984984">These all are southern states with four or five border southern states as Oklahoma and Missouri, and Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.595" offset="1018734">There have been in recent years two Oklahoma and Missouri that have had bills to repeal them but they did not pass the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.777" offset="1055514">Now, in dealing with the equal protection argument, we feel that on its face, on its face, these laws violate the equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.314" offset="1097624">They violate the Fourteenth Amendment, and in dealing this, we look at the arguments advanced by the State and there're basically two arguments advanced by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.127" offset="1136912">On one hand, they say the Fourteenth Amendment specifically exempted marriage from its limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.155" offset="1165019">On the other hand, they say if it didn't, the Maynard versus Hill doctrine would apply here, that this is only for the State to legislate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.990" offset="1208383">In replying to that, we think their health and welfare aspect of it is in essence and we hope to show to the Court, these are not health and welfare laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.835" offset="1251746">These are slavery laws pure and simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.611" offset="1266792">Now for this reason, we went to some length in our brief to go into the history of these laws, to look at why Virginia passed these laws and why other States have these laws on a books and how they used these laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.768" offset="1315485">Without reiterating what is in the brief, I will just refer to that history very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.321" offset="1337637">As we pointed out in the brief, laws go back to the 1600s.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.377" offset="1349862">The 1691 Act is the first basic Act we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.683" offset="1363132">There was a 1662 Act which held that the child of a Negro woman and a white man would be free or slave according to the condition of his mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.919" offset="1400121">It's a slavery law and it was only concerned with one thing, and it's an important element in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.935" offset="1420184">Negro man, white woman, that's all they were really concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.809" offset="1439619">I think maybe all these still concern with.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.472" offset="1450277">It's purely the white woman, not purely the Negro woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.973" offset="1464278">These laws robbed the Negro race of their dignity.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.803" offset="1475563">It's the worst part of these laws and that's what they're meant to do, to hold the Negro class in a lower position, lower social position, the lower economic position.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.017" offset="1512448">1691 was the first basic Act and it was entitled an Act for this pressing of outline slaves and the language of the Act is important while we go back to it because they talk about the prevention of bad abominable mixture and spurious issue and we'll see that language time and again throughout all the judicial decisions referred to by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.766" offset="1591442">And then they went into two centuries of trying to figure out who these people were that they were proscribing.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.273" offset="1617460">I won't touch upon all the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.907" offset="1624043">I understand amicus will do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.017" offset="1636477">But at one time, in 1705 it was a person with one-eight or more Negro blood and then in 1785, it became person with one quarter or more and it went on and on.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.725" offset="1671272">It wasn't until 1930 that we finally arrived that what a Negro is in the State of Virginia, that's a person with any traceable Negro blood, a matter which we think defies any scientific interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.554" offset="1726652">And the first real judicial decision we get in Virginia was in 1878 when the Kinney versus Commonwealth case came down.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.508" offset="1762388">And there again, we have a very interesting decision because in Kinney versus Commonwealth, they talk about the public policy of the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.951" offset="1808154">Now what that public policy was and how would it be applied?</text>
            <text syncTime="430.897" offset="1828007">If Your Honors will indulge me, I have the language here which is the language that had carried through, through the history of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.610" offset="1858832">And they talk about spurious issue again, and that is what's constantly carried through and carried through for an act to suppressing of outlawing slaves.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.609" offset="1906792">And they talk about the church southern civilization, but they didn't speak about the southern civilization as a whole but this white southern civilization.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.666" offset="1943050">And they want the race as kept distinct and separate, the same thing this Court has heard since Brown and before Brown, but it's heard so many times during the Brown argument and since the Brown argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.711" offset="1995191">And they talk about alliances so unnatural that God has forbidden them and this language --</text>

            <text syncTime="692.393" offset="2873950">There's no crime for Malaysian to marry a Negro and it's a -- it's a valid marriage in Virginia but it would be a void marriage for Malaysian or any other race aside from Negro to marry a white person.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.335" offset="2921702">A void marriage but there'd be no criminal penalty against anyone but the white person.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.161" offset="2937062">They were not concerned with the racial integrity but racial supremacy of the white race.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.643" offset="2970917">In 1930, they finally, as I said before, went on, say any person with traceable Negro blood with a Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.410" offset="3009996">Now, these laws, Your Honors, are ludicrous in their inception and equally ludicrous in their application.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.483" offset="3042283">It's not possible to look at just the Virginia laws alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.908" offset="3056076">You have to look at what happened in the whole south we feel and the classifications in the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.564" offset="3078646">It's impossible to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.569" offset="3082721">I won't go to again, the exact illustration of Negroes but South Carolina, North Carolina make certain Indians white people.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.951" offset="3108216">North Carolina, Cherokee and Robeson County is a white person, all of the Cherokee Indians, and Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.590" offset="3134757">In South Carolina is the Kato Indians and these laws came to invent to these other very hateful laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.904" offset="3155968">In Mississippi advocate of social equality under the mis -- miscegenation body of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.994" offset="3180419">It's a criminal penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.931" offset="3184076">I think it carries one to five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.388" offset="3209989">If Your Honor please, there are several decisions handed out by States which again point out the racial feeling concerning these laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.259" offset="3249382">The Missouri laws bottomed on States versus Jackson which basically held that if the progeny of a mixed marriage, married the progeny of a mixed marriage, there'd be no further progeny and fundamentally ridiculous statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.610" offset="3306851">Maybe it wasn't for those men in that day and age but it certainly is now and Georgia has an equally ridiculous basis for the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.447" offset="3334228">In Scott versus Georgia where they held that from the daily observances, they see that the offspring of such marriages are feminine.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.993" offset="3376337">And in this case, and I will refer to the appellant's brief here at page 35, the Loving case comes to you based on the case of Name versus Name.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.045" offset="3436628">Now, what were they talking about in Name versus Name?</text>
            <text syncTime="834.837" offset="3443733">Again, they wanted to preserve the racial integrity of their citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.530" offset="3462541">They want not to have a mongrel breed of citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.184" offset="3477170">We find there no requirement that the State shall not legislate to prevent the obliteration of racial pride but must permit the corruption of blood even though it weakens or destroy the quality of the citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.515" offset="3518443">These are racial and equal protection thoroughly proscribes these.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.856" offset="3539864">In the case before you, the opinion of the lower court, Judge Bazile, and we have the footnote in page 37 of our brief, which says, "Almighty God created the right races, white, black, yellow, malay, and red and he placed them on separate continents," and I didn't read the whole quote, but it's a fundamentally ludicrous quote and again, that's what they're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.799" offset="3651563">We feel the very basic wrong of these statutes is they rob the Negro race of their dignity and fundamental in the concept of liberty in the Fourteenth Amendment is the dignity of the individual, because without that, there is no ordered liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.616" offset="3726900">We've quoted from numerous authorities and particularly not for the scientific point but particularly, I refer you to the quotes from Gunner Murdel who's made a noted study in recent years of this, and not the old studies that are otherwise quoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.136" offset="3788967">Your Honor please, there's one other issue that the State raises that I will touch on briefly, and that's the Fourteenth Amendment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.198" offset="3845183">To begin with the state advances, no history of the Fourteenth Amendment debates themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.108" offset="3864827">They go to the debates of the 1866 Act and the Freedmen's Bureau Bills which did immediately precede the Fourteenth Amendment and then in their own brief, they have an excellent cite that the Fourteenth Amendment was impart designed to provide a firm constitutional basis for the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.579" offset="3950717">We would advance that the in part is the answer to the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.193" offset="3965137">Even if you read in the history, the 1866 Act, it's much broader in scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.826" offset="3983736">Its language is much broader in the scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.255" offset="3993454">The language of liberty, due process is much broader than the rights, privileges and immunities that were put in to the 1866 legislative act.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.951" offset="4028249">It was more than an effort to put these laws beyond the grasp before the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.459" offset="4054267">It was a greater protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.271" offset="4069522">And Your Honor please, even if you want to take the history of the Civil Rights Bill of 1866, we feel even reading that language, that wasn't clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.387" offset="4141934">It's up to the Court to decide what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.328" offset="4153741">Many legislators felt it would proscribe, that the Civil Rights Act itself, would proscribe this type of laws in the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.612" offset="4194806">Even various proponents said amalgamation laws were now touched and basically what they rely on in their brief, and in their argument in the court below, and I might point out to Your Honors that this was argued fully in the court below and the Virginia Supreme Court didn't base the rule on the argument, but push to the side and went to the merits of whether these laws were or were not unconstitutional, taking into account before taking them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.891" offset="4303997">As I recall, this was put before this Court in the McLaughlin case, well I know it was and it was put before the lower court in McLaughlin cases, the same argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.710" offset="4343286">Now while McLaughlin was cohabitation, I think you'd have to read those laws together if they were intended to be reached because they spoke of amalgamation laws in the arguments of the 1866 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.856" offset="4395844">But even if you would read the language of Senator Trumbull which they rely on so strongly, what did he really say?</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.900" offset="4423952">Well, one point page 17 in their brief, he says, "I presume there is no discrimination in this respect" and he goes on to talk about his argument, the law as I understand it in all States applies equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.086" offset="4476719">This was the Pace reasoning which this Court has set aside, but the real tip off we feel on this comes on page 22 where they're quoting Trumbull again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.804" offset="4523635">And he says, "This bill would not repeal the law to which the senator refers," in reply to Senator Johnson, "if there is no discrimination made by it, if there is no discrimination made by it."</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.309" offset="4569610">We submit very strongly as it had been before the Court many times that the application of the Fourteenth Amendment is an open-ended application even on these laws, even when we had this argument, because this is if it's not discriminatory, Your Honors must reach the conclusion whether it's discriminatory or not and it is clearly discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.809" offset="4659681">We speak of this on page 30 and 31 of our brief, quoting Bickel, a noted constitutional authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.651" offset="4691028">He said, "They were open-ended and meant to be expanded in light of changing times and circumstances" and quoting this Court from Burton versus Wilmington Parking authority, "Its constitutional assurance was reserved in terms of imprecision was necessary if the right were to be enjoyed in the variety of individual State relations."</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.817" offset="4771694">There are any number of such quotes in your opinions in the last ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.846" offset="4787785">The same argument you had before you all the time that the Fourteenth Amendment doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.235" offset="4809310">Your Honors very adequately answered that argument in the McLaughlin decision when you said, "This was essential purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment" and we submit very strongly, it is the essential purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.906" offset="4872004">If Your Honors please in resting on the equal protection argument, we fail to see how any reasonable man can but conclude that these laws are slavery laws were incepted to keep the slaves in their place, were prolonged to keep the slaves in their place, and in truth, the Virginia law still views the Negro race as a slave race, that these are the most odious laws to come before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.381" offset="4989868">They robbed the Negro race of its dignity and only a decision which will reach the full body of these laws in the State of Virginia will change that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.073" offset="5028739">We ask that the Court consider the full spectrum of these laws and not just the criminality, because it's more than a criminality that's at point here, that the legitimacy of children right to inherent land, the many, many rights, and in reaching a decision, we ask you reach on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.585" offset="5098747">Thank you Your Honors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1266.333" offset="5169695">We were here merely to obtain a reversal on behalf of Richard Perry Loving and Mildred Jeter Loving.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.138" offset="5196967">I think Mr. Hirschkop would have presented a cogent and complete argument based upon the Equal Protection Clause which would leave no course but to find the statutes question unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.558" offset="5258616">However, while there is no doubt in our minds that these statutes are unconstitutional and have run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, we urge with equal strength that the statutes also run afoul of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.616" offset="5350881">Now, whether one articulates in terms of the right to be free from racial discrimination as being due process under the Fourteenth Amendment or whether one talks of the right to be free from infringement of basic values implicit in ordered liberty as Justice Harlan has said in the Griswold case, citing Palko versus Connecticut or if we talk about the right to be free from arbitrary and capricious denials of Fourteenth Amendment liberty as Mr. Justice White has said in the concurring opinion in Griswold or if we urge upon this Court to say as it has said before in Myer versus Nebraska and Skinner versus Oklahoma that marriage is a fundamental right or liberty and whether we go further and urge that the Court say that this is a fundamental right of liberty retained by the people within the meaning of the Ninth Amendment and within the meaning of liberty in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1376.708" offset="5611269">Well, surely that's -- there's some limit on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.254" offset="5629450">I suppose you would agree that -- that a State could forbid a marriage between a brother and a sister, wouldn't you?</text>

            <text syncTime="1388.145" offset="5656931">We have conceded that the State may properly regulate marriages and may regulate divorces and indeed they have done so and this Court has upheld certain regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.283" offset="5705519">I don't know whether the issue of consanguinity or affinity has ever been here but certainly the one that comes to my mind first would be the Reynolds case in the polygamy matter and that we have no trouble distinguishing those, and I -- I don't think the Court will either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.145" offset="5756928">There was no race question involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1425.709" offset="5807188">Well, I -- I have stated that the Due Process Clause has been subject to many articulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.049" offset="5836549">And what I was going to go on to say was that all of these articulations can find some application in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.736" offset="5875315">If you ask me for the strength of the argument of the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause as applied to this case, I urge most strongly that it be on the basis of the Fourteenth Amendment is Amendment to protect against racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.166" offset="5929023">However, I do not think that the other arguments are completely invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.528" offset="5942502">I -- I don't even know if the Court ever has to reach them, but one can still argue that there is liberty and a right to marry as this Court has said in Myer and Skinner and that in no way, detracts from our argument that they cannot -- the State cannot infringe upon the right of Richard and Mildred Loving to marry because of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.297" offset="6053575">These are -- these are just not acceptable grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.583" offset="6074681">We are talking about an arbitrary and capricious ground and we -- we should have no trouble.</text>

            <text syncTime="1499.893" offset="6103939">But some -- some people might think it was reasonable that it's arbitrary and capricious to forbid first cousins to marry each other, state rights to live does have such a law prohibiting first cousins for marrying each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.436" offset="6158169">Now the -- because large body of opinion might think that's arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.650" offset="6183037">Does that mean that the State has no constitutional power to pass such a statute?</text>

            <text syncTime="1524.859" offset="6203831">I believe that we run into another step before we can reach that Your Honor and that is the burden of coming forth with the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.688" offset="6247194">I think that a State can legislate and can restrict marriage and might even be able to go so far as to restrict marriage between first cousins as some States have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.517" offset="6282512">And I think that if that case were before the Court, they would not have the advantage that we have of a presumption being shifted and a burden being shifted to the State to show that they have a reasonable basis for proscribing inter-racial marriages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.471" offset="6354296">However, if we were here on a first cousins case, I think we would have the tougher road to hoe because we would have to come in and show that the proscription was arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.091" offset="6396719">It was not based upon some reasonable grounds, and that is a difficult thing for an appellant to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.590" offset="6422737">Thankfully, we are not here with that burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.705" offset="6431201">The State is and we submit that the State cannot overcome that burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.300" offset="6449591">Not only do we submit that they cannot but for the purposes of this case, we certainly submit they have not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.907" offset="6472056">Nowhere in the State's brief, nowhere in the legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment, nowhere in the legislative history of Virginia's antimiscegenation statutes, is there anything clearer than would -- Mr. Hirschkop has already elucidated that these are racial statutes to perpetuate the badges and bonds of slavery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.561" offset="6546662">That is not a permissible state action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1749.854" offset="7103801">The racial composition certificate, Section 20-50 says that anybody in Virginia who applies to the State registrar vital statistics shall be given a certificate of racial composition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.013" offset="7148419">He goes and he says -- he goes up to the clerk of the Court and says, "I'm white.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.462" offset="7162211">I want a certificate of racial composition or I'm white or Negro.</text>

            <text syncTime="1770.769" offset="7187498">And if the clerk looks at him and believes him, he him fill out something and certifies that to the way it looks to him this person is white, or is Negro, and he sends down to Richmond and he gets a certificate of racial composition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.286" offset="7237548">To the best of my knowledge, this has not been used in recent years and I don't know what is its extent was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.011" offset="7264402">Back around 1924, except the legislative history shows that they brought in the state registrar of vital statistics and he testified that there was great confusion under the old law as to who is a member of which race and that they were having a little bit of difficulty determining who is a member of which race and who could be proscribed from marrying whom and called for this very strict statute which now says that white persons may only marry white persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.290" offset="7381535">Therefore, what they've done is make it a crime for a white person to marry a Negro or a Negro person to marry a white person, but it's not a crime for a Negro to marry a Malaysian.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.911" offset="7424063">It's a void marriage in Virginia and they may be prosecuted for violation of the fornication statutes but not for violation of the -- of the antimiscegenation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.999" offset="7468366">The Section 20-54 merely makes civil disability apparent in a white -- in a marriage between a -- a white and a Malaysian or a Negro and a -- a -- well, we're not exactly sure about that but between a white and anybody else, but another white or a Negro, it is not a criminal act and therefore, they are under great civil disability.</text>

            <text syncTime="1920.808" offset="7787583">As I started to say before, no matter how we articulate this, no matter which theory of the Due Process Clause or which emphasis we attach to, no one can articulate it better than Richard Loving when he said to me, "Mr. Cohen, tell the Court I love my wife and it is just unfair that I can't live with her in Virginia."</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.897" offset="7887997">I think this very simple layman has a concept of fundamental fairness and ordered liberty that he can articulate as a brick layer that we hope this Court has set out time and time again in its decisions on the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.334" offset="8013699">With respect to the legislative history urged by the State as being conclusive that the Fourteenth Amendment did not mean to make unconstitutional State statutes prohibiting miscegenation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.837" offset="8079736">We want to emphasize three important points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.783" offset="8091544">One, only a small group of Senators in any of the debates cited ever expressed themselves at all with respect to the miscegenation statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.617" offset="8130832">There are perhaps five or six that are even quoted and these were for the Freedmen's Bureau Bill in the Act -- Civil Rights Act of 1866.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.268" offset="8169493">If absence of debate ever has any influence at all, this is a classic case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.239" offset="8193317">Nowhere has the State been able to cite one item of legislative debate on the Fourteenth Amendment itself with respect to antimiscegenation statutes, not one item.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.062" offset="8248696">All of their references are to the 1866 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.930" offset="8264161">And again, we point out that those comments were very carefully worded by both proponents and opponents of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.659" offset="8299060">Again, we carefully point out that their own record of the legislative history shows that they were just as many Senators who believed that indeed, especially the Southern Senators who States had antimiscegenation statutes, they were just as many of them who did believe that the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 would invalidate such an Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.933" offset="8376174">Their own passages that they printed in the brief around pages 30 through 33 are replete with support for our argument that -- that the -- at best, at best, the legislative history is inconclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.496" offset="8446391">And as this Court has found before and we hope will continue to find, the Fourteenth Amendment is an amendment which grows and can be applied to situations as our knowledge becomes greater and as our progress is made and that there will be no problem in finding that this set of statutes in Virginia are erroneous to the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.056" offset="8628621">I have been questioned about the right of the State to regulate marriage and I think that where the Court has found that the State could in fact regulate marriage within permissible grounds, they've gone on as they did in the Reynolds case to find that the people that there was a danger to the principles on which the Government of the people to a greater or lesser extent rests.</text>

            <text syncTime="2231.198" offset="9029235">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.309" offset="9049610">My name is William Marutani, legal counsel for the Japanese American Citizens League which has filed a brief amicus curiae in this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.849" offset="9091824">On behalf of the Japanese American Citizens League, I would like to thank this Court for this privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.945" offset="9124216">Because the issues before this Court today revolve around the question of race, may I be excused in making a brief personal reference in this regard?</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.088" offset="9184716">As a Nisei, that is American born and raised in this country but whose parents came from Japan, I am and I say this with some trepidation of being challenged, perhaps among those few in this courtroom along with the few other Nisei who happened to be here this morning, who can declare with some degree of certainty, the verity of his race, that is at the term race is -- as defined as an endogamous or inbreeding geographic population group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.351" offset="9341764">This means the broad definition of convenience utilized by anthropologists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.694" offset="9371126">Now, those who would trace their ancestry to the European cultures where over the centuries, there have been invasions, cross-invasions, population shifts with the inevitable cross-breeding which follows and particularly those same Europeans who have been part of the melting pot of America, I suggest would have a most difficult, if not impossible task of establishing what Virginia's antimiscegenation statutes require namely, and I quote, proving that, "No trace whatever of any blood other than Caucasian."</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.211" offset="9561192">This is what Virginia statutes would require.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.676" offset="9575090">Incidentally, this presupposes that the term Caucasian is susceptible of some meaningful definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.545" offset="9606541">A burden incidentally which Virginia's laws somehow conveniently overlooks, but then this same infirmity applies to the remaining 15 States which have similar antimiscegenation laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.893" offset="9679997">Now, one of the most sophisticated anthropologists with all their specialized training and expertise, flatly reject the notion of any pure race and in this connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.549" offset="9734541">I refer to the UNESCO proposal, a statement on race which is attached to Appendix A to the amicus brief, and incidentally, also signed by Professor Carleton Coon who is a very frequently cited by those who would uphold racial differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.010" offset="9820432">Now, notwithstanding the fact that anthropologists, reject, flatly reject the concept that any notion of a pure race under Section 20-53 of Virginia's laws, that clerk or the deputy clerk is endowed with the power to determine whether an applicant for a marriage license is, "Of pure white race," a clerk or his deputy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.336" offset="9925757">Moreover, the common law of Virginia would have layman as its clerks, judges and juries, take a vague and scandalous terms such as colored person, white person, Caucasian and apply them to specific situations coupled with the power in this layman to invoke civil and criminal sanctions where in their view an interpretation of these terms, the laws of Virginia had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.300" offset="10065565">I believe no citation is required to state or to conclude that this is vagueness in its grossest sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.295" offset="10113526">I refer the Court again to the decision of this Court in Giaccio versus Pennsylvania decided in 1966 in which the Court stated, "Such a law which leaves judges and jurors free to decide without any legally fixed standards what is prohibited and what is not in each particular case fails to meet the requirements of the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.242" offset="10217388">Now, let us assume arguendo that race -- there are such things as definable races within the human species that these can be defined with sufficient clarity and certainty as to be accurately applied in particular situations and further let's assume that the State of Virginia's laws do exactly this and incidentally, all of this is something that the anthropologist have not been able to do it, we submit but nevertheless, the antimiscegenation laws of Virginia and its sister states are unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.749" offset="10367436">For if the antimiscegenation laws purport to preserve morphologic or physical differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.482" offset="10398365">That is a differences essentially in the shape of the eyes, the size of noses or the texture of hair, pigmentation of skin, such differences are meaningless and neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.926" offset="10452072">They serve no proper legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.373" offset="10469940">To state the proposition in itself is to expose the other absurdity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.270" offset="10493450">Moreover, the antimiscegenation laws would take the aspiration of marriage which is common to all people and which is otherwise blessed by the State and which institution incidentally has found of course upon one of man's biological grimes, it would take this and solely on the base of rates, it would convert it into a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.827" offset="10599717">In McLaughlin where this Court considered a Florida statute which involved " concepts of sexual decency dealing with extramarital and premarital promiscuity, this Court nevertheless struck down such statute because it was formulated on racial classification and thus laid an unequal hand on those who committed intrinsically the same quality of offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.821" offset="10707655">Now, for the appellants here, Richard Loving and Miller Loving marriage in and of itself is not a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.165" offset="10737016">It is not an offense even under Virginia Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.431" offset="10754152">By Virginia Clause, it was their race, it was their race which made it an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.498" offset="10790410">Incidentally while Mr. Loving apparently admitted that he was white and thereby admitted to the fact which rendered his marriage a criminal act under Virginia's laws, it is suggested that he was incapable of making a knowing admission that he was "A pure white race" or "Had no trace whatever of any blood other than Caucasian."</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.649" offset="10898975">Now, we further submit that the antimiscegenation laws involved an unequal application of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.693" offset="10935129">Virginia's express state policy for its antimiscegenation laws has been declared to maintain "Purity of public morals, preservation of racial integrity as well as racial pride and to prevent a mongrel breed of citizens."</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.272" offset="11017467">However, under these antimiscegenation laws since only white persons are prevented from marrying outside of their race and all other races are free to intermarry and within this particular context, they're free thereby to despoil one another and destroy their racial integrity, purity and pride, Virginia's laws are exposed for exactly what they are, a concept based upon racial superior -- superiority that of the white race and white race only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.555" offset="11166574">Now, we submit that striking down of the antimiscegenation laws, well first of all, not to do certain things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.600" offset="11218819">It will not force anyone to do what he presently does not wish to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.689" offset="11243165">It does not force anyone to marry outside of his race by striking down the antimiscegenation laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.047" offset="11272631">By striking down the antimiscegenation laws, no one is called to do, undo anything what she has already done and in this connection, perhaps a distinction maybe made to the Brown case or the School Desegregation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.191" offset="11337206">On the contrary by striking down the antimiscegenation laws, freedom of choice will be restored to all individuals including those who are opposed to racial intermarriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.318" offset="11401676">For the white person who marries another white person does not, under Virginia's laws as they now stand has any other choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.547" offset="11450577">We submit that race as a factor has no proper place in state's laws that governing whom a person by mutual choice may or may not marry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.840" offset="11495717">Now, the major such statutory intervention upon personal freedom may be exposed by applying the same operative racial principle in reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.940" offset="11540125">Let us suppose that the State of Virginia exercised its powers of determining -- of applying this racial principle so that it decreed at every citizen must marry a person of a different race, this would indeed be shocking that the same operative principle is happen to be geared in a way it is presently geared makes it no less shocking and the meaning to the citizen.</text>

            <text syncTime="3091.201" offset="12469248">As an Assistant Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Virginia, I appear as one of counsel for the appellee in support of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals of our State affirming the constitutional validity of the two statutes which are involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.949" offset="12536226">In view of what has been said before, it may not be inappropriate at this point to emphasize that there are only two statutes before this Court for consideration, Section 20-58 and 20-59 of the Virginia code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.412" offset="12598084">These statutes in their combined effect, prohibit white people from marrying colored people and colored people from marrying white people under the same penal section and forbids citizens of Virginia of either race from leaving the State with intent and purpose of evading this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.558" offset="12682616">No other statutes are involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.630" offset="12694946">No attempt has been made by any Virginia officials to apply any other statute to the marital relationship before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.129" offset="12728905">The decision of the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia can be read from beginning to end without finding any other statute mentioned in it except 20-58 and 20-59 with the exception of that one provision which relates to the power of Court to suspend the execution of sentence upon which ground the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia referred this case back to the lower court to have a new condition of suspension imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.331" offset="12837679">With that exception, only two provisions of the Virginia Code are mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.822" offset="12855651">Therefore, we take the position that these are the only statutes before the Court and anything that may have to do with any other provision of the Virginia Code which imposes a prohibition on the white race only or has to do with certificates of racial composition, whatever they may be, are not properly before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.821" offset="12935690">This is a statute which applies to a Virginia situation and forbids the intermarriage of the white and colored races.</text>

            <text syncTime="3260.417" offset="13146028">That is the 20-54 statute against which I myself could find a number of constitutional objections perhaps in that it imposes a restriction upon one race alone which it does not oppose on the other races and therefore, more stringently curtails the rights of one racial group.</text>

            <text syncTime="3289.714" offset="13263266">But this is because in Virginia, we have only two races of people which are within the territorial boundaries of the State of Virginia in sufficient numbers to constitute a classification with which the legislature must deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.358" offset="13333797">That is why I say the white and the colored prohibition here completely controls the racial picture with which Virginia is faced.</text>

            <text syncTime="3320.577" offset="13386668">Well, we have Indians Your Honor, but this is the point that we make with respect to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.419" offset="13406104">Under the census figures of 1960, 79 and some odds hundreds percent of the Virginia population was made up of white people, 20 and some odd hundred percent of the Virginia population was made up of colored people, whites and Negroes by definition of the United States Department of Commerce Bureau of the Census.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.913" offset="13500040">Thus, 99 and 44 one hundredths percent of the Virginia population falls into these two racial categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.894" offset="13532014">All other racial classes in Virginia combined do not constitute as much as one-fourth of 1% of the Virginia population.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.624" offset="13574855">Therefore, we say that this problem of the intermarriage of whites and orientals or Negroes and orientals or any of these two classes with Polynesians or Indians or Asiatic Indians is not a problem with which Virginia has faced and one which is not required to adopt its policy forbidding interracial marriage too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.493" offset="13662417">A statute of course does not have to apply with mathematical precision, but on the basis of the Virginia population, we respectfully submit that the statute before the Court in this case does apply almost with mathematical precision since it covers all the dangers which Virginia has a right to apprehend from interracial marriage in that it prohibits the intermarriage of those two groups which constitute more than 99% of the Virginia population.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.792" offset="13779550">Now, so far as the particular appellants in this case are concerned, there is no question of constitutional vagueness or doubtful definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.964" offset="13812255">It is a matter of record, agreed to by all counsel during the course of this litigation and in the brief that one of the appellants here is a white person within the definition of the Virginia law, the other appellant is a colored person within the definition of Virginia law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.823" offset="13871710">Thus, the Court is simply faced with the proposition of whether or not a State may validly forbid the interracial marriage of two groups, the white and the colored in the context of the present statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3471.417" offset="13990097">We have the question of whether or not that marriage would be recognized as valid in Virginia even though it was contracted by parties who are not residents of the State of Virginia under the conflict of laws principle that a marriage valid were celebrated is valid everywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.456" offset="14070241">This would be a serious question and under Virginia law, it is highly questionable that such a marriage would be recognized in Virginia, especially since Virginia has a very strong policy against interracial marriage and the implementing statutes declare that marriages between white and colored people shall be absolutely void without decree of divorce or other legal process, the implementing statute which forbids Virginia citizens to leave the State for the purpose of evading the law and returning, the exception to the conflict of laws principally I've stated that a marriage valid was celebrated would be valid everywhere except where contrary to the long -- to the strong local public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.923" offset="14244112">The Virginia statute here involved thus expresses a strong local public policy against the intermarriage of white and colored people.</text>

            <text syncTime="3605.307" offset="14525607">The first contention is that the Fourteenth Amendment viewed in the light of its legislative history, has no effect, whatever upon the power of States to enact antimiscegenation laws specifically, antimiscegenation laws forbidding the intermarriage of white and colored persons and therefore as a matter of law, this Court under the Fourteenth Amendment is not authorized to infringe the power of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.440" offset="14646188">That the Fourteenth Amendment does not read in the life of its history, touch much less diminished the power of a States in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.993" offset="14680357">The second contention, an alternative contention is, that if the Fourteenth Amendment be deemed to apply to State antimiscegenation statutes, then these statutes serve a legitimate, legislative objective of preventing a sociological, psychological evils which attend interracial marriages, and is a -- an expression, a rational expression of a policy which Virginia has a right to adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.993" offset="14796340">So far as the legislative history of the amendment is concerned, we do not understand that this Court has ever avowed in principle, the proposition, that it is necessary in construing the Fourteenth Amendment to give effect to the intention of the Framers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.149" offset="14873036">With respect to the instant situation, you are not presented with any question involving a dubious application of certain principles to a situation which was unforeseen or unknown to those who framed the principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.654" offset="14934998">The precise question before this Court today, the validity under the Fourteenth Amendment of a statute forbidding the marriage of whites and Negroes was precisely before the Congress of the United States 100 years ago when it adopted the amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3850.682" offset="15507080">Others thought that the Act was perfectly constitutional but that it could be repealed and that it was necessary to place it in the Constitution to keep it from being repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.327" offset="15541666">Still, others thought that the First Section of the Fourteenth Amendment was nothing but the Civil Rights Bill of 1866 in another shape.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.892" offset="15575939">Nobody suggested that the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and its adoption into the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution expanded the rights which were covered in the 1866 Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.333" offset="15633721">And certainly no one suggested that what was expressly removed from the 1866 Act was reinserted in the Constitution in the Fourteenth Amendment within a period of just a few months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.189" offset="15681160">Now, the debates on the Civil Rights Act of 1866 clearly show that the proponents, those who had the billion charge, those who were instrumental in passing the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment clearly in answer to questions put by their adversaries stated in no uncertain terms that the Bill had no application to the States' power to forbid marriages between white and colored persons, not simply amalgamation but specifically between white and colored persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.399" offset="15809996">This was repeatedly stated by Senator Trumbull who was the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee who steered the bill to the passage and was instrumental in passing the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment by Senator William Pitt Fessenden of Maine, who was the leading Republican member on the Joint Committee of Reconstruction of Fifteen, and by various other members who supported the Bill, and steered it to passage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.357" offset="15909784">Now, text writers have disagreed as to whether or not the charge that the Civil Rights Act of 1866 would invalidate state laws was seriously made or whether it was made for political purposes simply as a smoke screen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.549" offset="15966626">Regardless of the purpose for which it was made, the historical fact remains that the challenge was put by those who disagreed with the Civil Rights Act of 1866, that it would affect the power of the States to pass antimiscegenation statutes, and the proponents and the managers who had the bill in charge absolutely denied that it would have any such effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.116" offset="16068817">No one who voted for sponsored or espoused the Civil Rights Act of 1866 dared to suggest that it would have the effect of invalidating state antimiscegenation statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.108" offset="16124824">Plus, we have a clear intent on the part of those who framed and adopted the amendment to exclude this area of state power from the reach of the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4015.862" offset="16167873">And this history is buttressed by the fact that the state legislatures, which ratified the amendment, clearly did not understand that it would have any effect at all upon their power to pass antimiscegenation statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="4559.432" offset="18342097">Our reading of the legislative history is sufficient to lead us to believe that if anybody had suggested that it would have that affect, the entire first section of the Fourteenth Amendment would have been lost.</text>

            <text syncTime="4751.599" offset="19110828">That there is a rational classification, setting so far as the Virginia population is concerned, for preventing marriages between white and colored people who make up the -- almost the entirety of the State population, and that this is supported by the prevailing climate of scientific opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="4798.550" offset="19298597">We start with the proposition, on this connection, that it is the family which constitutes the structural element of society and that marriage is the legal basis upon which families are formed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4813.289" offset="19357529">Consequently, this Court has held, in a numerous decisions over the years, that society is structured on the institution of marriage that it has more to do with a welfare and civilizations of the people that any other institutions and that out of the fruits of marriage spring relationships and responsibilities with which the state is necessarily required the deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4834.922" offset="19444046">Text writers and judicial writers agree that the state has a natural direct and vital interest in maximizing the number of successful marriages, which lead to stable homes and families and in minimizing those which do not.</text>

            <text syncTime="6563.380" offset="26357927">In the brief on behalf of appellants, with this I will move to a conclusion, an article is cited which is I say we think it to be the best balance of the authorities investigating this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="6580.333" offset="26425741">I suppose that in reading from it, I can summarize best the results of an investigation of the materials, which are available, and the characterization of those materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="6594.637" offset="26482897">The author of that article says this, "Reference to scientific and sociological evidence of the undesirability of amalgamation is frequently made but the courts have rarely examined any of this evidence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6607.399" offset="26533992">The California Court in Perez made the first real inquiry into the evidence and found that the weight of the evidence refuted the view that the Negro race or the progeny of interracial marriage is inferior.</text>
            <text syncTime="6619.046" offset="26580595">It is not the purpose of this article to reach any conclusion regarding the available scientific data on the results of miscegenation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6626.891" offset="26611942">It will suffice to indicate by a brief survey of the materials that there are may arguably be sufficient evidence on both sides of the controversy to afford some basis for a legislature to take either side.</text>
            <text syncTime="6642.115" offset="26672859">He goes on, a large number of studies and research projects have concluded that miscegenation is undesirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6648.162" offset="26696997">He points out that Justice Shenk dissenting in Perez cited 10 authorities, one of which itself cited 10 additional authorities which would support a legislative finding that amalgamation of the races is inimical to the public welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="6660.639" offset="26746943">He says that these studies were frequently made by notable scientists and it reached that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6665.700" offset="26767214">He then goes on and says the authorities' finding that interracial, intermixture has no harmful effects are also quite numerous and he considers that authorities available on that point, including the UNESCO statement and he concluded, “Nonetheless, there is still a considerable debate in comparatively recent studies as the desirability of racial intermixture.</text>
            <text syncTime="6687.254" offset="26853418">Thus, even today, a legislature can find some scientific support for the position that miscegenation should be banned.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6695.809" offset="26887586">He then goes on to say that of course the sociological evidence is even more persuasive in support of a policy against miscegenation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6705.233" offset="26925307">And in the later portion of the article, he takes the position that even if the presumption of the validity of the statute should be reversed and the State were required to carry the burden of justifying the statute as a piece of social legislation, he says that the social harm argument would present a closer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6728.555" offset="27018616">He said, “But again, it is not likely that the State could prove that the social difficulties of the children of miscegenous couples are exceptional enough to overcome a presumption against racial categorization.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6740.264" offset="27065428">He is assuming here that the presumption is against the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="6743.946" offset="27080161">Concrete evidence of the effect upon such children would be difficult to obtain particular since miscegenation is not widespread.</text>
            <text syncTime="6751.944" offset="27112135">The State then could not present any definite estimate of the potential of the evil it is attempting to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6757.721" offset="27135331">A State might produce a strong case by investing in research, but that would involve considerable time and expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="6765.402" offset="27166051">Now of course, we say it involves no time and the expense is simply an expenditure of $10.</text>

            <text syncTime="7183.068" offset="28836634">I would say that the right to marry if I was rationalizing a decision upholding it would under the decision of this Court in Meyer against Nebraska and Pierce against Society of Sisters and Skinner against Oklahoma, but also say that the right to marry is a right but there is no requirement that people marry and therefore, a statute which forbids marriage is not the same as forbidding children to receive education.</text>
            <text syncTime="7216.054" offset="28968605">Now if you're going -- if you say a decision is going to uphold the statute then you just naturally flow from the fact that marriage is a right that it cannot be arbitrarily infringed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7228.403" offset="29018028">Then if you make the statement that any racial classification necessarily infringes the right, then you have a decision of course would be consistent with Brown against Board of Education, if you take that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="7242.357" offset="29073826">But in that case, you do not come to the proposition of the power of the State to forbid interracial marriages and the interest of the state in doing so on the basis of the valid scientific evidence that exists on the detrimental effects of interracial marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="7261.887" offset="29151984">I don't see how you can start with the right and come to the proposition that the state statute infringes the right unless you exclude the evidence which tends to show that the statute in question is rational because even rights, a right to marry is subjective to reasonable limitations by the State as always been.</text>
            <text syncTime="7283.104" offset="29236830">Polygamy statutes have never been questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="7285.069" offset="29244667">Incest statutes have never been questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="7286.756" offset="29251459">They have in fact been specifically upheld and upheld against the charge in Reynolds against the United States that the person convicted there had religious duty to marry, not to the other right to marry, his religious tenet as a Mormon required him to marry.</text>
            <text syncTime="7303.085" offset="29316765">And this Court held that the fact that its religious tenet required him to do so, did not prevent him from being convicted criminally about engaging in a polygamous marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="7314.243" offset="29361382">So you can't reach the conclusion that this statute infringes, a right under the Fourteenth Amendment without examining evidence on behalf of the State to show that the infringement is a reasonable one, just as reasonable as far as we can determine, as far more evidence of the reasonableness of a ban against interracial marriage than there is against polygamous or incest marriages so far as the scientific proposition is concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="7341.812" offset="29471619">But I cannot conceive to this Court striking down the polygamy or incest statute on the basis of scientific evidence, and I submit that it would be no more appropriate for this Court to invalidate the miscegenetic statute on that basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="7430.825" offset="29827720">The State has made a strong argument in favor of the Court limiting its decision to Sections 20-58 and 20-59 but has very, very carefully avoided the fact that 20-58 which -- which is classified as evasion statute is much more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7452.791" offset="29915596">20-58 cannot exist without 20-54 because it refers to a white person and there is nowhere else the Virginia Code that a white person is defined other than in Section 20-54 which is the general ban on interracial marriages.</text>
            <text syncTime="7470.157" offset="29984977">So, if he says that 20-58 and 20-59 are before this Court, it is absolutely -- absolutely necessary that 20-54 also be considered because 58 and 59 could not stand without the definition in 54.</text>
            <text syncTime="7487.446" offset="30054149">In addition, the definition of colored person appears in Section 1-14 of Virginia Code and so it is here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="7497.121" offset="30092915">These are the very minimum number of sections which can possibly be involved, but we go further.</text>
            <text syncTime="7504.126" offset="30120918">When the Racial Integrity Act of 1924 was passed, it was passed as a single act with 10 sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="7510.203" offset="30145160">It is true and we do not argue with the State that 20-58 and 59 were Sections which had pre-existed the Racial Integrity Act of 1924 and we're just added on with other sections, but it was part and parcel one act and today, the mere fact that it's codified with Virginia Code with different numbers does not the detract from the fact that it was passed as one legislative act on one day with the same vote before the Virginia Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="7537.553" offset="30254561">They are inseparable.</text>
            <text syncTime="7542.931" offset="30276086">The State has urged that the legislative history is conclusive on the Fourteenth Amendment and that nobody has stated that the Fourteenth Amendment did expand the meaning of equal protection and due process over and above what was meant to be included in the Civil Rights Act of 1866.</text>
            <text syncTime="7563.425" offset="30358110">In our brief at page 30, we take issue with this and again at page 32, citing Bickel, the original understanding of desegregation decision and we go on to say referring to the Bickel work that a correct appraisal of the legislative history of the broad guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment for purposes of constitutional adjudication is that they were open ended and meant to be expounded in light of changing times in circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="7594.558" offset="30482662">On page 32, we indicate that the Bickel article has concluded that the principle of the Brown case should control the constitutionality of the miscegenation laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="7605.119" offset="30524876">This is in the Bickel article, The Least Dangerous Branch at page 71 published in 1962.</text>

            <text syncTime="7636.253" offset="30649428">If the Framers had the intent to exclude antimiscegenation statutes, it would have been taken but a single phrase in the Fourteenth Amendment to say excluding antimiscegenation statues.</text>
            <text syncTime="7649.391" offset="30701986">The language was broad, the language was sweeping, the language meant to include equal protection for Negroes that was at the very heart of it and that equal protection included the right to marry as any other human being had the right to marry subject to only the same limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="7669.769" offset="30783488">The State has said that the amount of persons other than Negroes and whites involved is very insignificant and very small.</text>
            <text syncTime="7680.594" offset="30826747">Well, this is the first Negro-white miscegenation case in Virginia to come to the Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="7708.762" offset="30939491">So to say that the problem itself is insignificant in Virginia is not at all true which reflected in the actual case law in Virginia, the case of Calma versus Calma, involved a Filipino, the case of Name versus Name involved a possible oriental whose background was not exactly clear from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="7735.802" offset="31047638">Now, the State is ignoring a very important point which we cannot overemphasize if this decision only goes to Sections 58 and 59 of the statute and that is the right of Richard and Mildred Loving to wake up in the morning or to go to sleep at night knowing that the sheriff will not be knocking on their door or shining a light in their face in the privacy of their bedroom for illicit cohabitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7766.911" offset="31172086">If 58 and 59 are found unconstitutional and 54 is allowed to remain on the books that is precisely what can happen.</text>

            <text syncTime="7852.974" offset="31516275">Rabbi Gordon states and it is not printed in the State's brief, our democracy would soon be defeated if any group on the American scene was required to cut itself off from context with persons of other religions or races.</text>

            <text syncTime="7936.102" offset="31848761">You're almost in the same dilemma yourself, aren't you, according the Virginia legislative history of Virginia statute, but finding that the legislative history of Fourteenth Amendment (Voice Overlap) report.</text>

            <text syncTime="7950.264" offset="31905499">No, but I -- no, I don't feel that dilemma at all Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="7953.507" offset="31918456">We do not for a moment concede that the legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment is clear or conclusive that they meant to exclude miscegenetic marriages while Mr. McIlwaine has stood here and I believe conceded that the intent of the Framers of 1924 Act of -- of Racial Integrity was a White Supremacy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7970.887" offset="31987942">So I don't feel it at all uncomfortable in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7980.797" offset="32027544">Now, on the one hand, the State urges that it is not necessary to prohibit or to -- for the statute to go against smaller minority groups that exist in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="7996.262" offset="32089401">And I say that why have they taken the trouble in Section 54 to prohibit marriages between whites and Malaysians or white and anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="8006.002" offset="32128376">The fact of the manner is that it is important to the statutory scheme of Virginia to discriminate against anybody but white people.</text>
            <text syncTime="8018.190" offset="32177173">Now, while there is no definitive case decision as to whether or not a New York couple involved in a miscegenetic marriage moving to Virginia will be prosecuted for a felony and I admit it might be open to some judicial interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="8038.733" offset="32259302">I feel strongly and I think the Court can reach this decision and -- and I think some authorities writing in law journals have reached the decision that under Section 20-59, referring to any white person, intermarrying with a colored person, he shall be guilty of a felony and shall be punished by confinement of the penitentiary for not less than one or more than five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="8062.300" offset="32353552">I don't see how there's any doubt appearing in a very same Racial Integrity Act of 1924.</text>
            <text syncTime="8069.458" offset="32382182">Five sections after the act which says it shall hereafter the unlawful for any white person in the state to marry any save a white person.</text>
            <text syncTime="8077.730" offset="32415305">I don't see how it is possible to conclude that even a New York couple would not be prosecuted for a felony in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="8086.423" offset="32450100">In any event, the State is conceded that they certainly would be guilty of a crime that of illicit cohabitation and has left be rest open.</text>
            <text syncTime="8095.386" offset="32485940">We argue that certainly that there is no doubt that there are some prosecutors at the lower trial level some places in Virginia that would have no compunction whatsoever in going ahead and prosecuting under 59 as a felony couples moving into the State involved in miscegenetic marriage.</text>

            <text syncTime="8136.171" offset="32649049">I think the State's position and the appellant's position come together and agree at only one point but the Court should not go into the morass of sociological evidence that is available on both sides of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="8155.573" offset="32726685">We strongly urge that it is not necessary and that our position on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment specifically related to it being an anti-racial amendment, give this Court sufficient breadth and sufficient depth to invalidate the entire statutory scheme.</text>
