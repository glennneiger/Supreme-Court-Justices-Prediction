            <text syncTime="16.968" offset="67814">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.958" offset="83801">This is -- this case arises on a certiorari to the appellate term of the Supreme Court of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.417" offset="113580">The judgment of conviction was under an obscenity law under the state obscenity law.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.813" offset="135210">Certiorari was limited, three justices dissenting to the issue of scienter.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.812" offset="167184">The case arose in the following manner, on April 10, 1964, a patrolman named Grakenstein (ph) came to a newsstand on 42nd Street that was about 6 p.m.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.571" offset="258194">And this newsstand was at a subway arcade, an entrance to a subway arcade.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.846" offset="291318">He said to the attendant, the clerk, the petitioner here pointing to a book rack, Lust Pool and Shame Agent, two books of those two types.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.763" offset="350981">The petitioner gave him the two books.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.013" offset="364042">So testified the police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.888" offset="379507">And he gave the petitioner a dollar for the two books.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.677" offset="406674">The petitioner said, “They're 90 cents each.”</text>
            <text syncTime="104.567" offset="418168">And he said, “I'm sorry” then pointed to the one that said 75.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.976" offset="431856">And the petitioner said, “Well then give me $1.65.”</text>
            <text syncTime="110.309" offset="441156">He paid the $1.65 for the two books, then he placed it in a brown paper bag after that he had taken the bag, he announced that he was a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.893" offset="483474">The clerk said to him, the petitioner here, “What's wrong?”</text>
            <text syncTime="123.654" offset="494550">This fellow have a search warrant to search the place.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.559" offset="506149">He wasn't permitted to state what kind of search he conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.610" offset="522344">He said he -- he asked the petitioner who he worked for.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.194" offset="540735">The petitioner said, he worked for a Milton Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.484" offset="553900">He asked him how long he have worked there.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.246" offset="560901">He said, “About two years” alternating between a bookstore downstairs in the subway and this newsstand.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.625" offset="594442">He stated to the officer, again, this is the conversation that he earns $75.00 a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.951" offset="619729">And then the officer said to him calling to the officer, “Why do you sell this garbage?”</text>
            <text syncTime="159.850" offset="639373">And he says, “There's worse stuff than that around, I think that these books here are worse,” pointing to some girly magazines that were on top.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.682" offset="670720">This was the testimony after the prosecution and prosecution rested at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.593" offset="698305">The petitioner took the stand.He testified that he had been working for this Mr. Black for about two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.979" offset="743863">His salary was $75.00 a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.323" offset="753267">He had never been in any trouble before, never arrested or convicted of any offense or anything to that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.092" offset="776359">He hadn't read these books and knew anything about the contents of the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.369" offset="801437">He had no recollection of his alleged oral conversation he was supposed to have with the police officer and in general simply stated that he had been there for about an hour, he was relieving somebody who had been ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.064" offset="860160">He had once relieved that way about a week before, but generally he was downstairs within the bookstore generally.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.311" offset="977189">"Well, do you have these kinds of books here and did you see other books,” and he said, “Yes, there were other books of this kind here.”</text>
            <text syncTime="250.035" offset="1000072">That is but all that you have in this newsstand and as far as this record is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.413" offset="1029642">The -- or as far as oral conversation was concerned, the officer testified that while it was his custom to make notes of every conversation he had on arrest, at this time he had not made any notes of such a conversation and nor had he included in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.612" offset="1090351">That in general is the case and the basic question here on appeal is whether or not the evidence in the constitutional sense is sufficient to the obscenity prosecution to establish the guilty knowledge in a lawful intent that is required by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.891" offset="1195468">Now, on that issue to start off with, I would simply say this Court has stated on many occasions that when factual issues come to the court entangled in some constitutional claim, that it will review the evidence with the scrupulous care demanded by the Constitution that I take it to be basic.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.170" offset="1276656">Secondly, this Court has stated that the standards for judging whether or not the proof is sufficient where First Amendment issues are involved, where criminal -- alleged criminal speech is involved are very high.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.658" offset="1354606">In civil actions, this Court has spoken of it as -- it has to be clear, convincing, and unequivocal.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.120" offset="1380415">Without any troubling doubt as solid in criminal cases, this Court has stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.893" offset="1407478">It has to be beyond the reasonable doubt at the substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.250" offset="1432973">Our position here is that based on those standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="421.198" offset="1684689">But in answer to that, may I state this, this Court has stated in Roth, in Jacobellis, in Memoirs, that the elements of the effects of obscenity before you can be found guilty as far as the book is concerned is that that book must go beyond contemporary community standards under the fiction of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.016" offset="1756056">It has to appeal to a prurient interest and has to be utterly without redeeming social importance.</text>

            <text syncTime="450.827" offset="1803285">Now, if that be the situation if you have to prove that, it would seem to me that it follows that the scienter you're talking about, that you spoke about in Smith against California must be the knowledge as in any case whether it's criminal or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.306" offset="1865143">Knowledge that these elements exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.609" offset="1878413">Otherwise, he doesn't know that it's obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.435" offset="1889698">It follows therefore that the problem is not standard and this is where the difficulty comes from my friend's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.109" offset="1916343">The problem is not standard they must prove knowledge of obscenity, the question is, how much must they prove?</text>

            <text syncTime="489.969" offset="1959811">But for a trial judge to tell the jury that all you have to find out is that's he knew the contents and he is guilty on scienter would not be following the standards that are required in the light of this Court's decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="588.871" offset="2355409">I say this factually.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.345" offset="2361365">It's never enough to merely say a man were shown to have read the book or to have known the contents and per se with nothing else with no other acts or conduct on the part of the defendant to say that merely from the reading of the book one can infer that he knew that the book went beyond community standards and appealed to prurient interest and was utterly without redeeming social value.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.950" offset="2451749">And so it seems to me that in every one of these cases, the trial court simply has the duty to say to the jury that you must find that he knew the book was obscene as I defined obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.211" offset="2500754">Now, you can of course find that from all the elements in the case, all the circumstances in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.467" offset="2521861">What he did, and if he read the book etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.859" offset="2535340">But that in essence is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.854" offset="2547357">Now, based on that, based on these standards it does not seem to me that a case has been made out here on the constitutional sense to support this conviction on the scienter issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.448" offset="2593750">He was an innocent clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.312" offset="2601169">Everything that's in this case shows innocence, price is just nominal.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.790" offset="2623112">The statement is just a statement of protestation of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.242" offset="2636904">He'd never been convicted before.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.351" offset="2645368">He denied he had the conversation and I must say as far as oral conversations are concerned, oral admissions, Wigmore -- Professor Wigmore has pointed out that's the most untrustworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.401" offset="2685597">You want to come in to say, “Why do you keep this and would you want your children to read this?”</text>
            <text syncTime="675.730" offset="2702838">And then immediately he has known that -- he has assumed to know the contents of the book but to know that it's obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.795" offset="2727079">If that practice were assumed no bookseller or distributor would be safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.686" offset="2762710">And so, we think that actually all that has been proven here is innocence and innocence never proves guilt and certainly in the case involving the First Amendment that should be the end of it and that conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="814.331" offset="3257260">Given that any obscenity prosecution in the State Court, requires proof of the element of scienter.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.055" offset="3284219">The question was left open in Smith, what sort of mental element is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.642" offset="3310550">The second question left open in Smith was, “Does an honest mistake concerning the obscenity of the work excused from criminal liability?”</text>
            <text syncTime="838.316" offset="3353182">Now, in New York our statute has been mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.641" offset="3370527">It does not specifically refer to scienter as an element.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.681" offset="3386723">But following this Court's decision in Smith, our high court in Finkelstein construed our statute as implicitly requiring proof of that element.</text>

            <text syncTime="875.024" offset="3500095">This Court in Michigan quoted the operative language from Finkelstein and in fact underlined the two phrases in that sentence from the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.239" offset="3544921">The Court of Appeals there said that our statute requires awareness of the character of the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.544" offset="3574073">That it is not innocent but calculated prevails of obscenity which is proscribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.071" offset="3600196">Unfortunately in this entire area, these words have been very loosely used and surprisingly never defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.329" offset="3629244">The term character is frequently used interchangeably with context.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.800" offset="3647112">I dare say that there are some jurisdictions which feel that the word character means the legal character of the work but I suggest that it's just a susceptible of the construction of factual character.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.929" offset="3687654">That is to say the category, the type of work, based upon those objectively discernible characteristics or particular a piece of material.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.545" offset="3726106">And I suggest that the Court of Appeals if they intended to say knowledge of what?</text>
            <text syncTime="937.452" offset="3749721">Did so in an extremely imprecise fashion and I think the conviction and affirmance of the conviction in this case illustrates that the courts of New York have not interpreted to think of the case as requiring knowledge of the obscenity of the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.718" offset="3802802">It is our submission here that neither did Smith -- scienter as a mental element traditionally refers to knowledge of operative fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.538" offset="3842090">Indeed, it is the circumstances which is susceptible of knowledge by the ordinary layperson or to which the criminal law is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.072" offset="3880229">I dare say that obscenity itself is such a difficult concept, legal conclusion that there are many experts in this field who themselves would hesitate to express a firm knowledge that a particular work was obscene because what is involved there is really a prediction of the outcome of litigation are all the way up to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.192" offset="3968731">And in as much as this Court has disagreed on particular pieces of work with reference to their obscenity, I think it would be extremely difficult to require knowledge of obscenity from a lawyer let alone from layperson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.229" offset="4024842">Of course, I have seen knowledge defined and broken down in the best spectrum of degrees of knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.827" offset="4055249">All the way from an accurate certainty through negligence to inquire down to perhaps a doubt of the truth of the converse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.865" offset="4103419">But I suggest that although these distinctions between different types of knowledge are perhaps interesting from an academic sense that they are virtually impossible to apply at any sort of standard in a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.539" offset="4158067">And therefore it seems to me that the question that was left open in Smith is not precisely phrased as what sort of knowledge but rather knowledge of what.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.623" offset="4210416">If it were to be construed as knowledge of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.469" offset="4233822">We would not have reached the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.459" offset="4245734">I think this Court would not have reached the result it did in the Ginzburg case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.251" offset="4264960">For -- in the advertisements of the material in that case which were accepted at face value by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.810" offset="4295158">It was quite clear that while Ginzburg was advertising his work as salacious that he was making no bones about it according to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.211" offset="4332774">I think at the same time he was evidencing his own belief that the material was constitutionally protective and therefore not obscene because in point of fact, he stated as you -- as the court of calls that the United States Supreme Court an it's decision has specifically allowed the distribution of that sort of material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.113" offset="4412395">Consequentially, it seems to me that this court in reaching that decision was implicitly recognizing the fact that the scienter could not be the subjective belief in obscenity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1175.547" offset="4702145">So, it seems to me that in that sense the second question of Smith really is just another aspect of the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.047" offset="4736104">This Court in New York Times against Sullivan in an analogous First Amendment case referred to the Smith question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.964" offset="4783856">And stated that what was required by Smith was guilty knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.330" offset="4805277">Again, following this -- the decisions of this Court in Garrison against Louisiana that guilty knowledge was construed to mean a high degree of awareness of the probable falsehood of the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.149" offset="4880509">Well once again, they would seem to me that the knowledge of falsehood would be called a factual sort of determination and not a prediction of the legal conclusion and therefore this own Court's reference to the Smith knowledge is factual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.880" offset="4943517">Indeed despite the fact that the sort of knowledge was left as an open question there in the body of the Smith decision itself contents are referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.657" offset="4998583">Another analogous area of course is the area of subversion and thereto this Court has looked to the question of scienter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.699" offset="5030766">And has required not only knowledge by an individual adjoining a subversive organization of its purposes but a shared intent in those unlawful purposes but again, this was a factual sort of scienter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.110" offset="5088340">It was not knowledge that if he engaged in this conduct, he would be violating the law that it would be subversion but only the espousal of the purposes, a factual determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.104" offset="5152392">The petitioner in a footnote purports to recite -- does no more in States which have in their laws construed the scienter requirement as knowledge of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.412" offset="5221564">However, a reference to those cases and to other cases and those jurisdictions reveals that unfortunately this is a term which in application loses its significance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1812.743" offset="7250965">I think that a distinction would have to be made quite sharply between knowledge and intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.755" offset="7274998">Unfortunately the distinction which is rarely made but it should be in the criminal law, I think that as to knowledge the mental element of knowledge one could be quite content with a factual knowledge as to mens rea or intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.534" offset="7338109">What we would be doing in effect is converting this crime into a crime of specific intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.433" offset="7369665">The problem of intent as the commentators have noticed in field very frequently is the type of intent whether it would be general or specifically it's not very clearly spelled out and I would say that in New York this usually thought to the legislation to say at least the local state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.113" offset="7432359">But in New York we have not deem this to be a crime of specific intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.564" offset="7450227">However, consistently with the opinion of this Court in Ginzburg and related cases I can easily see how it might become a constitutionally necessary element in the crime to prove that the material was distributed with the intent to appeal the prurient interest which is a specific intent rather than a general mens rea sort of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.405" offset="7541551">And I think that this is the kind of element that would probably be imperceptible of proof.</text>

            <text syncTime="1990.018" offset="7960033">But I would have answered somewhat differently a greater length of question of what this has to do with the Constitution, Mr. Stewart in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.223" offset="7996813">The theory of Smith was that because of certain inherent and necessary vagueness in the concept of obscenity and because these ambiguities unfortunately have a tendency to promote self-censorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.017" offset="8064000">In violation of the spirit of the First Amendment it is necessary to so far delimit the area of prosecution as to minimize the hazard of self-censorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.388" offset="8109453">And that the First Amendment requires us without such measures as will minimize the hazard of self-censorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.671" offset="8138606">That I think is the way the intent factor or the knowledge factor comes into the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.741" offset="8166922">I do think that however that if it's elusory to believe that by requiring proof to come back to knowledge for a moment, proof of knowledge of obscenity as a means for minimizing the hazards of self-censorship, we're diluting ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.505" offset="8234005">It has a superficial appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.659" offset="8242573">If you think of the very hardest core pornography they very rarely any doubt that anyone who sees that must know at once not only it's facts or factual character of it but also that it is obscene in proscribed by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.672" offset="8298684">Consequently, in eliminating prosecution to the hardest of the hard called pornography but which perhaps is a worthwhile end indeed in New York, our law has been construed as being limited to prosecution of hardcore pornography.</text>

            <text syncTime="2093.809" offset="8375171">Unfortunately, this superficial appeal evaporates when you see in the way in which it's applied because just as to one person, something it's unequivocally hardcore pornography and anyone looking at it should have known that it was obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.173" offset="8428669">So to another judge to another court are something, are considerably further along toward the border is just as unequivocally pornographic and should have been perceived as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.198" offset="8472764">Consequently, I think that it's elusory to think that we can limit and then -- we were back to the same problem of the definition of obscenity and the fact that courts differ on obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.850" offset="8519367">I think the border disputes will be with us as long as obscenity is an exception to the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.359" offset="8545384">I do think however that it may be constitutionally preferable to look at it in terms of intent now that we have the Ginzburg decision rather than in terms of knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.201" offset="8600764">I think it would be an outrage to the theory of the criminal law to require that anyone prosecuted for a crime to be guilty must believe in his own guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.261" offset="8649038">I think it would be circular to define pornography as that which anybody looking at it would know what's pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.336" offset="8685296">Obviously, the circularity of that definition is out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.014" offset="8700029">Consequently, I don't think that the constitutional purpose of limiting the hazards of self-censorship is served as adequately by redefinition of the traditional concept of scienter as it would be by pursuit of Justice Fortas' suggestion that we look at it in terms of scienter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2750.862" offset="11003402">I think it -- in answering the arguments of the state to it -- once again state that this Court in Smith against California reiterated and carried forward the thought that it had announced in Roth and Alvis (ph), that an obscenity limitation on speech is an exception and therefore the standards for judging obscenity would have to be narrowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.455" offset="11105802">And as against claims of vagueness, against claims of possible self-censorship this Court said, "We will put in a requirement of scienter."</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.217" offset="11148852">And in Smith reiterated that that the obscenity laws in general would be in serious difficulty constitutionally unless there was proof of scienter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.551" offset="11194201">Now this Court also had said, time and again in cases as a significant as perhaps this area, cases involving advocacy built to overthrow the Government by force and violence, there must be proof of specific intent, there must be proof of guilty knowledge because if you don't have that then there are possibilities, great possibilities of self-censorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.063" offset="11284167">People will be afraid to talk.</text>

            <text syncTime="2824.092" offset="11296287">People will be afraid to express themselves and the whole country and the community suffers as a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.045" offset="11316140">Now, what does the state argue here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.827" offset="11327216">The state virtually tells us that although the man who sells the book or distributes or even the publisher is absolutely innocent in his intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.160" offset="11364624">He really doesn't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.440" offset="11373714">And they can't prove that he knows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.761" offset="11383014">Nevertheless, he must stand convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.395" offset="11393567">Can this lead to anything else if the rule is adopted that the state asked for, which is not only a delusion of the scienter requirement but actually elimination and a pre-Smith situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.401" offset="11445603">Can it be anything else but the same self-censorship which this Court has constantly tried to admonish must not happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.429" offset="11477682">Now as far as Ginzburg is concerned, my friend forgets the cause that in Michigan, this Court emphasized that the scienter proof is stringent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.939" offset="11519687">And as far as Ginzburg was concerned I think the question of scienter was stipulated out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.732" offset="11542883">And if it -- as to whether Ginzburg believed that it was constitutionally protected, I suppose an answer might be a trier of the facts if you had proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.360" offset="11593352">If the record in Ginzburg had proof that nevertheless would show that he did believe it was obscene, then I suppose you have a situation where you didn't have to believe them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2930.431" offset="11721665">Let me say this that if the record in the Ginzburg case which of course I'm not familiar had no evidence of the man's guilty knowledge or specific intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2952.977" offset="11811840">Now on the question of specific intent and guilty knowledge that was raised by Justice Fortas, I would say simply this, I had always understood that both elements are required and as a matter of fact in the States of Louisiana and Ohio, those are the two requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.734" offset="11890834">But one is dependent on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.703" offset="11902746">In other words, specific intent, the intent to appeal the prurient interest knowing that it goes beyond community standards and has any value, that specific intent to appeal the prurient interest is a state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.313" offset="11953215">How do you prove a state of mind?</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.858" offset="11963350">Only by the clearest proof that the man had guilty knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.846" offset="11979337">So that you would have to prove that he knew that the material was obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.776" offset="11999086">He knew that it went beyond contemporary standards and knew that it had appealed to a prurient interest and knew he was utterly without value and (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <text syncTime="3007.293" offset="12029074">Well, isn't there another approach to it and that is, without trying to answer the very difficult question of what he knew or he believed as indicated by Ginzburg as I read it, that the man promoted that what he sold, that he tried to get people to buy it on his representation that it would appeal to prurient interest or whatever more suitable words might be so that you don't get in -- on that basis perhaps you don't get into the refined semantics of scienter, may be getting to some other refined semantics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.265" offset="12217051">But in any event you don't get into those particulars.</text>

            <text syncTime="3056.987" offset="12227918">I think you would, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3064.576" offset="12258220">I didn't suggest -- excuse me, but I didn't suggest eliminating it, I suggested the possibility that when you start using as your instrument for a decision, not the legal concept of scienter but the legal concept of specific intent, perhaps then the role played by the concept of the scienter becomes diluted and therefore perhaps the necessity for a precise definition, a meticulous finding and it even comes less appealable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3102.498" offset="12409940">And I -- if I may continue this dialogue, Your Honor, just for one more moment then I would say this, that if you do attempt to -- you have these two standards that is guilty knowledge plus a specific intent and in any way try to dilute one or the other, you always have the basic problem, how does this comport with First Amendment requirements?</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.795" offset="12515161">Will this lead to ambiguity, further ambiguity?</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.593" offset="12530312">And will this lead to the type of self censorship which we must avoid if speech in press ought to be free in the country?</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.174" offset="12564689">In any event, I return to my initial position here that there is simply no evidence in the constitutional sense that is sufficient to justify the conviction that's like Redmond.</text>
