            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="26.317" offset="208645">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.688" offset="226095">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Seventh Circuit which denied enforcement of a Board order requiring the company to furnish certain information to the union which the union requested in connection with the processing of grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.976" offset="319300">And the basic question presented is whether -- where the collective bargaining agreement between the parties has a standard type grievance and arbitration procedure which I will detail in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.882" offset="410937">This necessarily has the effect of channeling all requests for grievance information into that procedure and thereby preempting the power that the Board would ordinarily have to remedy refusals to furnish such information as an unfair labor practice under the National Labor Relationship Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.718" offset="542281">Now the underlying facts are relatively simple and maybe summarized as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.710" offset="574255">In April of 1963, at the conclusion of a strike, the company which is a manufacturer of tools and metal products in Chicago and the union, Local 310 of the autoworkers entered into a collective bargaining agreement covering the production and maintenance employees at the company's Laflin Street plant Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.933" offset="703091">The company has several other plants in addition.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.961" offset="723257">There are two substantive provisions of the contract which are relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.270" offset="752410">There is Article 1, Section (3) which is set forth at page 96 of the record, which is the so-called subcontracting clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.641" offset="805909">Under this clause in relevant part, the company agreed not to subcontract work which is normally performed by employees in the bargaining unit where this will cause the layoff of employees or prevent the recall of employees who would normally perform this work for the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.068" offset="915623">The second clause is the so-called work transfer clause which is Article 6, Section (10) set forth at page 102 of the record and that provides that in the event the equipment of the plant or of any department is hereafter moved to another location of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.628" offset="1029935">Employees working in the Laflin Street plant were subject to layoff or reduction and classification as a result of this transfer but have a right to follow the machinery to the new location unless of course there is a collective bargaining agreement at that location that would provide otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.341" offset="1148740">Now in addition to these two substantive provisions, this contract also contained a procedure for the processing of grievances which is set forth at pages 98 to a hundred of the record which is a first of all a grievances defined as a difference of opinion with respect to the meaning and application of the terms of this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.722" offset="1278307">And then you have three steps of the grievance procedure and if the grievance is not settled at the end of the third step, then the union has a right to take it to binding arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.307" offset="1352600">And the arbitration clause which is set forth at page 100 of the record again points out that the arbitrator's authority is limited to the interpretation of the terms of this agreement which ties in with the way the grievance is defined which I pointed out earlier as being a difference of opinion with respect to the meaning and application of the terms of this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.221" offset="1496273">It should also be pointed out that the subcontracting provision which is at page 96, the substantive terms of which I read specifically states that violation of the above, namely the subcontracting clause will be subject to the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.575" offset="1593657">Now, in January of 1964 some months after this contract was executed, the union discovered that machinery was being moved from the Laflin Street plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.650" offset="1658023">And there was no dispute in the record that machinery was being moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.668" offset="1686026">Union stewards asked the foremen why the machinery was being removed and where it was being relocated.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.959" offset="1743182">Because under the work transfer clause if it was going to another plant of the company, the employees here of they -- or losing jobs a result of this had a right to follow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.144" offset="1799920">Also, if the machinery was going to some other plant which would then be doing production work that this plant was doing under the subcontracting clause, employees who are -- or affected or were in layoff would have a right to grieve about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.723" offset="1878288">And I might add that the record shows that during this period it was not only the machinery being moved but you had in layoff a substantial number of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.471" offset="1949236">It fluctuated from 35 at one time to as high as 70.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.595" offset="1973791">Also you had employment dropping in the plant, it was a 190 at the end of the strike and it got down to a 115.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.413" offset="2017050">So there was some basis for the union's suspicions that something was occurring here.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.001" offset="2055398">So --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="488.064" stopTime="490.215">
            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="488.064" offset="2055607">Does the company have other plants Mr. Come?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="490.215" stopTime="688.402">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="490.215" offset="2064280">The company had other plants in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.751" offset="2078386">This contract however covered only the Laflin Street plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.641" offset="2097925">So the union stewards ask the foremen why the machinery was being removed and where it was being relocated.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.530" offset="2129481">The foremen said they would have to check it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.639" offset="2157902">They went to the industrial relations department and then they came back with the answer that since there had been no violation of the contract, the company was not obliged to furnish the union with any information.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.520" offset="2229478">This occurred several times, several different foremen got the same response.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.867" offset="2262810">The union then invoking the contract grievance machinery filed 11 grievances charging that the company by removing machinery from the plant had deprived the employees of job rights and employment in violation of the subcontracting and work transfer clauses of the contract which I outlined at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.367" offset="2376808">Without the information understandably the union couldn't get too far in the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.017" offset="2411395">So in April of 64, while these grievances were pending some on the first step and some on the second step of the grievance procedure, the president of the union wrote a letter to the company which is set forth at page a 124 of the record requesting five specific pieces of information, information as to the date on which each piece of equipment was moved from the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.663" offset="2545977">The place to which the equipment was moved whether it was a facility owned or controlled by the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.720" offset="2582235">The number of machines or equipment moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.202" offset="2596133">The reason for the move and whether or not the machinery was being used for production purposes elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.851" offset="2630823">The letter concluded with the statement that this information is essential to the union for the servicing and administration of the current contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.186" offset="2676067">The company flatly declined the union's request in a letter at page 125 of the record stating among other things that the union had available all the information it needed and that its questions were indicative of officiating and harassment expedition.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.148" offset="2775960">Well, the union thereupon filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Relations Board alleging that the company's refusal to furnish this information constituted a refusal to bargain collectively in violation of Section 88 (5) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="688.402" stopTime="700.964">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="688.402" offset="2856939">Well, Mr. Come with that letter of the company accurately as saying that no matter what we're doing, no employee is being laid off, no employee is being discharged because there's no basis for a grievance?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="700.964" stopTime="727.277">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="700.964" offset="2907199">I think that that is -- that is what they are saying however, our position is that that goes to the merits of the grievance and not to the union's right to obtain information.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.681" offset="2970102">The information, in fact verified this -- the union might not process the grievance further.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="727.277" stopTime="739.313">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="727.277" offset="3012524">Well, you're taking the position then that even if no employees were affected it's nevertheless an issue whether that the refusal to supply the information constitutes an unfair labor practice.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="739.313" stopTime="740.269">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="739.313" offset="3060590">Yes, Your Honor.</text>

          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="740.269" stopTime="749.896">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="740.269" offset="3064456">Even though the arbitrator might reach the conclusion that under the agreement there's no violation of the agreement because the no employees are affected.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="749.896" stopTime="775.570">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="749.896" offset="3102908">That is correct, because the union first of all thought that there were some employees affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.106" offset="3127777">That is an issue of fact for the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.868" offset="3138853">Secondly, under the subcontracting clause as I indicated at the out set there were employees in layoff and they would have a right to be recalled from the layoff if there were illegal subcontracting going on.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="775.570" stopTime="786.788">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="775.570" offset="3205622">And I supposed all that this assumes is that the Board has jurisdiction order that information be given to the union as ancillary to a grievance -- to the grievance procedure.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="786.788" stopTime="791.339">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="786.788" offset="3250552">That is correct Your Honor and that is the question that I intend to get to --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="791.339" stopTime="809.094">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="791.339" offset="3268733">Because I suppose when that -- can I ask you, is there any doubt that the Board has a power to order a company to give the union information as ancillary to collective bargaining?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="809.094" stopTime="909.966">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="809.094" offset="3339786">No, there is no doubt about that and I think we can start with two principles as to which there is no doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.965" offset="3379284">(A) That the duty to bargain imposed by Section 8 (a) (5) and 8 (d) of the Act extends beyond the mere negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.576" offset="3433723">It applies to the administration of the agreement as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.190" offset="3460159">The second principle that -- well, we can start with is that ordinarily the duty to bargain comprehends the obligation to furnish information that is relevant to the discharge of the union's bargaining function.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.206" offset="3540198">Be it -- they admitted -- be it a negotiation of the contract or the administration of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.898" offset="3562977">The problem here is whether or not it can properly be said that when the parties, the union and the company have negotiated a collective bargaining agreement that sets forth a grievance and arbitration procedure such as we have here which is limited to questions of interpretation arising under the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.504" offset="3673422">It can be said that they have not only channeled the substantive grievance to arbitration but also information request that are relevant to the processing --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="909.966" stopTime="947.054">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="909.966" offset="3743222">Can I clarify this for myself in a kind of a simple way.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.711" offset="3774255">Let's assume that these were -- clearly everybody agreed that what's involved here is a grievance, nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.043" offset="3807587">Then would the Board have jurisdiction order that the company give the union, information related to that grievance no question as to -- it's being possibly relevant to collective bargaining.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="947.054" stopTime="977.808">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="947.054" offset="3891597">I think that it would Your Honor and I think that's the -- that is this case is, as we view it because as I will attempt to show although the company in it's brief attempts to raise some question as to whether this is really a grievable matter under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.880" offset="3978846">I think it's perfectly clear there is not question that in this case the matters complained of are grievable matters.</text>

          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="977.808" stopTime="1007.300">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="977.808" offset="4014582">So that we have here the hard question as to whether the Board has a power under the statutory scheme, the order of the company to give the union information relating to a grievance not for purposes of collective bargaining in either sense, either in the sense of making the agreement or the administration of the agreement.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="1007.300" offset="4132551">That is correct with this footnote that I would interpolate that the processing of grievances is regarded as part of the process of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.588" offset="4185736">So that in discharging that function, the union is engaging in collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.825" offset="4214680">I think the decisions of this court and of the Courts of Appeals have made that perfectly clear, Of course the parties can by agreement, a channel, certain rights and the question is whether or not the Board was warranted in construing this kind of a grievance procedure that way it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.094" offset="4315721">And I would --</text>

            <text syncTime="1053.278" offset="4316453">Well, let's cut right into the bone with that analysis because doesn't the statute say that the Boards for now in effect that the Boards have no jurisdiction to what, construe the terms of the collective bargaining agreement?</text>

            <text syncTime="1072.306" offset="4392626">Well, I don't think that the statute says that in so many words and I might say that this issue is -- in our view is going to be presented in sharper focus in the case that follows.</text>

            <text syncTime="1090.993" offset="4467336">But -- if you want on just the statute, Section 10 (a) of the statute which is set forth on page 37 of the Board's brief, says that the Board is empowered as here and after provided to prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice affecting commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.017" offset="4563466">This power shall not be affected by any other means of adjustment or prevention that has been or maybe established by agreement, law or otherwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="1129.014" offset="4619473">Well, would that go so far Mr. Come, that this agreement had said on this very issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.817" offset="4638595">Suppose the parties have written a provision on this agreement and on this very issue the matter of the obligation of the company to supply information for the purpose of processing grievances shall be a matter exclusively for the grievance procedure and arbitration and that neither party may result to any other provision of law or otherwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="1253.533" offset="5117471">Before I do so, I just like to back up to make a -- to fill in a part of the chronology which I think is fairly obvious but I left off my factual account by saying that the union had filed the charge with the Board, a complaint was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.144" offset="5203989">The Board found that the information was relevant to the union's representative function under the contract that there had been no waiver of the union's right to obtain such information in advance of arbitration under this type of grievance and arbitration procedure and the Board issued an appropriate bargaining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.452" offset="5337213">The Court of Appeals disagreed and essentially along the lines that you were suggesting Mr. Justice Fortas in the -- that's why we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.894" offset="5390921">Now, let me get to the heart of our legal position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.040" offset="5439509">As I pointed out the grievance and arbitration provision here and the Board so found does not say anything about request for information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.116" offset="5503875">It talks only about questions of interpretation or application of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.429" offset="5537102">There is no provision in this agreement dealing with information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.916" offset="5571062">In short it's the standard type of what this Court referred to in the trilogy cases as the standard type of grievance and arbitration procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.587" offset="5621739">And therefore a dispute over information as such would not fall within the normal meaning of the terms -- questions of interpretation or application of the terms of this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.050" offset="5699584">Now, furthermore we submit and the Board found that it is reasonable and indeed would aid the efficient operation of the grievance and arbitration procedure to construe at least the standard type of arbitration provision is not encompassing information request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.087" offset="5811702">And the reason for that is that information is needed at the outset of a grievance procedure to enable the union to determine whether the grievance is worth processing further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.064" offset="5871679">As I pointed out, this grievance procedure like most of them has got three steps before you ever get to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.916" offset="5911071">Arbitration is the last and most costly step in the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.678" offset="5946075">Now, if the union gets the information at the outset, it may decide to drop the grievance because the information persuades it that there is no merit to the grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.727" offset="6002291">Or it might be able to persuade the employer to adjust the grievance without embarking in the costly informal course of arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.605" offset="6057775">I was looking at some statistics of the federal mediation conciliation service and they pointed out that the average cost of a one day arbitration hearing just taking into account the cost of the arbitrator, the attorney's fees and of the court reporter leaving out such things as travel expense and things of that sort, came to about $1600.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.323" offset="6176684">Now, on the other hand to hold that the information request must be presented to the arbitrator means that the union or either -- well as the Second Circuit pointed out in the Sepner case, it will be -- it will have to play a game of blind men's bluff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.522" offset="6257455">I mean, either they will have to take all grievances and arbitration which means that a lot of them are going to go there that the information would to be unmeritorious?</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.150" offset="6315969">The union would have to grope through the arbitration proceeding itself they all prepared or it will just have to arbitrarily drop a lot of grievances that information would have shown to be meritorious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.304" offset="6400606">The first form of the dilemma is only joined to make the grievance procedures which have already been criticized as being too cumbersome, plugged, protracted even more so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.139" offset="6471973">The other form of the dilemma is going to mean that the union could not adequately discharge its representative function at least in an intelligent manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.598" offset="6525785">What I have been saying about the grievance procedure being plugged is not sheer speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.381" offset="6552848">I think the union in its brief in the appendix to the brief points out that under the UAW General Motors contracts for example in the year of 1964, a 168,000 -- 158,000 written grievances were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.362" offset="6644799">Now about 67% of them were settled at the initial step, 25% at the second step and less than 1% went to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.314" offset="6704671">Now under that contract, they get the information in advance indeed the union has set up a screening procedure before they reached the final stage of arbitration in which they sift out many of these grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.166" offset="6780008">So in the light of this practical considerations we submit that the Board is reasonable in concluding that the standard type of arbitration should not be construed as a waiver of the union's right to get the information in advance of having to go -- to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.657" offset="6890036">And that such an interpretation far from being contrary to the difference which this Court in the trilogy has shown for the arbitral process would facilitate, enhance the arbitral process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.541" offset="6969553">Now, I want to point that there's no answer to suggest that the union could go to an arbitrator in advance and get -- have him require the production of this data.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.523" offset="7041442">In most jurisdictions, the arbitrator does not have subpoena power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.196" offset="7064116">Secondly even where he does and the company points out that he does under the Uniform Arbitration Act in Illinois, the arbitrator still sets to handle grievances that are unresolved by the earlier stages in the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.032" offset="7159515">He is not the administrator of the machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.942" offset="7171114">In other words, what I'm saying is that under this contract as -- is typical of most, you cannot go to the arbitrator until you have exhausted the other three stages of the grievance procedures so that the union would still have to go through what might well be the useless and burdensome act of going through three stages of the grievance procedure before they would be in a position to submit the matter to the arbitrator and ask him for a pretrial order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.511" offset="7297442">Secondly, where you have a setup as you have here whether there's no permanent arbitrator and you have only an ad hoc one established as the need arises you have to go through the further formal step of getting one selected and all of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.665" offset="7378004">I see that my time has expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.425" offset="7393050">I just like to close with the point that the company in its brief discusses a lot -- a lack of merit to the grievance as I pointed out in answer to Justice Brennan, I think that is a question that goes -- the merits of the underlying grievance which they give perfectly agreed to submit to the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.261" offset="7500466">The information indeed might have resulted in their washing out of grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.267" offset="7520423">If it has no merit and there is certainly no harm in furnishing the information to substantiate that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1953.896" offset="7918947">I was rather intrigued with the theory advanced counsel for the Board which apparently sounded something like what's good for General Motors is good for the nation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2027.893" offset="8214967">In 1964, the company removed this chucker from its plant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2062.333" offset="8352684">One month later, the union with regard of this chucker as well as several other pieces of equipment wrote the company asking for the date it was removed, the location to which it was removed, the purpose of the removal and whether it was used for production elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.385" offset="8432933">The case that we are dealing here amongst other pieces of equipment dealt with these questions with respect to a piece of equipment last used eight to ten years prior thereto.</text>

            <text syncTime="2096.898" offset="8490924">And now close to three years later, we are here arguing whether or not this employer violated the federal labor law by refusing to tell the union where, when and why a piece of equipment was removed, a piece of equipment last used ten to 12 years ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="3395.046" offset="13683545">I -- I assumed that would be a grievance at the very least but if they get the -- company would have to supply that information?</text>

            <text syncTime="3409.081" offset="13739656">Not necessarily I think of course that any union claim which claims a violation of contract constitutes a grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.666" offset="13770062">I think that if there were no employees affected thereby, that the employer would not have to give information.</text>

            <text syncTime="3426.554" offset="13809560">For example, this Court might take judicial notice when an employer is out on a strike, the customers can be lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.981" offset="13843310">And the record does not show as counsel for the Labor Board would indicate that employees were laid off at the commencement of this contract as an affirmative act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.520" offset="13885419">The record does not show that the -- in fact those employees were not called back to work after the strike because of the lost of the work.</text>

            <text syncTime="3452.151" offset="13911960">Well, then what you are saying as I understand it is that there are some types of situations in which a grievance exist between the company and the union subject to the grievance procedure of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.095" offset="13979773">That the nature of the dispute as such that also stands directly from certain provisions in the statute and then the latter cases, the Board processes are appropriate to require the company to give the union information.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Allan Kovar</label>
            <text syncTime="3490.343" offset="14064724">Yes, Mr. Justice Fortas, I believe so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.150" offset="14071933">For example, 8 (a) (1) interference, 8 (a) (2) domination, 8 (a) (3) discrimination, 8 (a) (4) interfering with the testimony or witnesses to a Board proceeding are particular prohibitions of the Act which whether or not covered by a collective bargaining agreement would nevertheless be cognizable by the Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.758" offset="14154376">The Board would retain its power whether or not the contract has anything to do with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.943" offset="14175169">But 8 (a) (5) deals with a refusal to bargain and 8 (a) (5) it seems to me must involve two types of bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.531" offset="14205471">One, pre-contract bargaining and two, post-contract bargaining and it is our contention that post-contract bargaining is not the same as pre-contract bargaining that the parties do have the right to channel the collective bargaining relationship between them during the term of that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.233" offset="14284257">That that parties do have a right to determine both the substance as well as the procedure of collective bargaining during the terms of that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.796" offset="14318529">And if this not be the case, it seems to me that what the Board is trying to do in this and in the companion case is to declare that an employer may not act unilaterally even during the term of the contract unless that contract specifically allows it to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.779" offset="14382477">And it seems to me what this Board is attempting to instill in the labor management relationship picture in this country is the idea that an employer may not act unilaterally without prior union approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.622" offset="14429811">And if that be the case then I say that the American industrial set up is in dire jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.121" offset="14451858">This is not a totally unimportant case involving just a hundred employees to the extent that that issue is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.023" offset="14483414">It involves all of American industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.295" offset="14496580">Thank you very much.</text>
