            <label>Mr. Daniel L. O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="13.216" offset="156191">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.445" offset="173119">The case which we are considering now is on appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.499" offset="197360">There are two cases which have been consolidated on this appeal both of which involved practically the same set of facts and the issues are identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.085" offset="243754">The cases below involved police officers who were serving the boroughs of Bellmawr and Barrington in the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.922" offset="291088">In the first case below, the appellants Garrity in virtue were indicted, tried and convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.548" offset="329540">There was a third defendant in that case a Mrs. Naglee who is not a party to this appeal by reason of the fact that she was deceased.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.218" offset="364231">The second case involved three police officers of the borough of Barrington, Mrs. Holroyd, Elwell, and Murray.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.929" offset="407071">As I've stated there's no basic dispute as to the facts in the case but because this case was allowed by this Court and jurisdiction -- the question of jurisdiction was deferred pending oral argument, I feel it necessary to go into the background before I reach the argument on jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.245" offset="500381">This case had its inception in an order of the Supreme Court of New Jersey dated June 30, 1961 or in it directed the Attorney General for the state to conduct an investigation into the practice of downgrading traffic ticket violations in these two boroughs namely Bellmawr and Barrington.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.217" offset="600273">Both order -- the order to investigate both boroughs was signed on the same date and the Attorney General designated one of his deputies to conduct the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.245" offset="652309">During the course of the investigation, it became necessary to take oral testimony of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.692" offset="690134">The New Jersey in 1953 enacted a state statute which became very pertinent in the taking of the statements in which is the reason why we're here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.848" offset="746768">Briefly, that statute provided it's denominated the generally is the official conduct statute and statutes of this type are not strangers to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.923" offset="799013">It provides briefly, that any person holding public office who haven't been sworn, refuses to testify or to answer any material question upon the ground that his answer may tend to incriminate him or compel him to be a witness against himself shall if holding public office be removed that forfeit his office, position or employment and any vested or future right or tenure, and pensions granted to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.450" offset="921161">That then goes on provide that he shall not be eligible to hold public office in the State of New Jersey for ever after.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.266" offset="952404">Now, prior to taking the statements and after swearing the defendants, the investigating Deputy Attorney General gave a warning in which he advised each defendant of his right not to incriminate himself but explain to them that if he -- if they made a disclosure then they would have to answer questions on all other -- answer all other questions which were asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.461" offset="1077164">And then after advising them of their right not to testify, he went on to nullify that right by saying, “but because you are police officers and there is a statute in this state which requires you to testify and if you don't then you will lose your jobs.”</text>
            <text syncTime="264.645" offset="1161906">Now, that warning all defendants testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.720" offset="1194297">They incriminated themselves by explaining the method of how tickets were downgraded and subsequently the state -- the State Supreme Court of the Attorney General's office referred the results of the investigation to the Camden County Prosecutor for presentation of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.042" offset="1279561">The grand jury indicted --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="295.859" offset="1286771">That warning that you refer to presumably emphasize there's an accurate statement of the Jersey law, wasn't it in the statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_l_oconnor" startTime="306.532" stopTime="1213.773">
            <label>Mr. Daniel L. O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="306.532" offset="1329507">It was an accurate statement of the law insofar as it went and as far as the statute was concerned, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.329" offset="1364720">There's no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.914" offset="1370990">In other words, what he and thinks and said what exactly what the statements says.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.310" offset="1392619">In other words, the statute says that if you refuse to testify and you are holding public office then you shall be removed from office.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.895" offset="1434937">The wording of the -- I'll read that just a little bit later because I want to read encompass in my argument the exact statement which was warning which was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.303" offset="1484570">They were indicted on a charge of conspiracy to obstruct the due administration of the motor vehicle traffic laws of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.753" offset="1510379">There was a trial at the trial after the introduction of evidence by the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.219" offset="1536293">The introduction of these statements became an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.855" offset="1550817">In the trial court for the extensive argument from the prosecutor, from defense counsel and participated in the argument and discussion himself as to whether or not this particular statute and the warning given was compulsory and whether or not the statements were voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.008" offset="1635453">The trial judge ruled that the statements were voluntary admitted them into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.110" offset="1655829">They were read to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.970" offset="1667218">Defendants were convicted and they filed a motion for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.735" offset="1690311">The motion for the new trial and at this juncture the Garrity case was tried first, the Holroyd case was tried second, when the motion for new trial was made they were consolidated and stipulations were entered by trial counsel in both cases at the issues were the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.417" offset="1765021">So the trial judge in considering the motion for new trial considered both cases together.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.538" offset="1797517">He rendered -- the motion for new trial was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.274" offset="1816430">But he rendered an opinion quite to link the opinion which appears at page 545 of the record and he touched specifically upon the constitutionality of the statute and as it related to the warning and to the admissibility of the statements of voluntariness of the statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.035" offset="1899499">He goes on at length in reviewing the Twining case.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.518" offset="1917471">He reviews the Adamson case and he quotes at lengths from Mr. Justice Black's dissent therein and in my opinion the frustration of the trial judge in not being able to hold the statute unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.936" offset="1987166">It displayed in one paragraph of its opinion and I would like to read it to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.568" offset="2009631">This in on page 547 of the record, “This Court is -- and this is a trial judge speaking, “This Court is also aware that the Adamson case was at five to four decision and that since 1947 notable expansion of the Due Process Clause has taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.312" offset="2100642">Then he goes on in spite of the above dissent referring to Mr. Justice Black's dissent and the continual broadening trend of the Due Process Clause a trial court must take the laws that finds it and cannot create new law at this level.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.674" offset="2166053">It follows therefore that the statute does not violate the federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.356" offset="2188831">I say and I think in all sincerity that the trial judge encountered a frustration there because it was his desire and his wish to declare it unconstitutional but because of the laws that stood at that time he was unable to.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.731" offset="2258317">From the trial court, an appeal was taken and in the appellate division which is an intermediate appellate step in the New Jersey jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.791" offset="2302516">The Supreme Court of New Jersey reached down and certified the case to itself, it heard argument from counsel, it considered the briefs and I must say the argument of counsel, the briefs of both parties, all touched upon the constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.971" offset="2375241">In the opinion of the Supreme Court of New Jersey, they made two findings which are extremely pertinent to us to here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.604" offset="2417768">One was that this statute created a type ought to be warning given by the Attorney General was a type of compulsion which could be legitimately used and then it went on and considered the constitutionality of the question and avoided that issue by finding that the defendants had no standing to question the constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.023" offset="2511496">Now, that brings me to the question of the jurisdiction of this Court to consider this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.399" offset="2544933">The appeal was taken under Section 1257 subparagraph 2, Title 28 and in order for jurisdiction to attach to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.929" offset="2599058">There are two factors which must be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.132" offset="2611911">One is, was the constitutionality of the statute and the issue in the courts below and secondly, did the state court render an adverse finding?</text>
            <text syncTime="639.407" offset="2661021">It's our contention that both factors are present at this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.089" offset="2679724">The trial judge made an expressed finding which I have read to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.690" offset="2698115">The Supreme Court even though it was raised on appeal and argued both in oral argument and brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.364" offset="2724864">The Supreme Court avoided the issue by saying that the appellants did not, were not in a position to challenge the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.193" offset="2756106">And I'd like to read from page 327 of the record, the exact language of the Supreme Court of New Jersey in that connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.629" offset="2793932">It's very short.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.479" offset="2801246">The defendants further contend that New Jersey statute 2 (a) 8117.1 is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.669" offset="2830085">As we have mentioned earlier in this opinion Mr. Reg, that's the Attorney General that took that statement and did not expressly threaten to invoke the sanction of the statute against the defendants Garrity in virtue.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.465" offset="2885256">The warning he gave them was to the effect that if they did not cooperate in the investigation they might be subject to dismissal as a result of a subsequent proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.997" offset="2927365">We determined that such a dismissal would be proper even in the absence of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.781" offset="2950457">Therefore, we conclude that the defendants in the circumstances of this case are not in a position to challenge the constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.919" offset="2999045">What the Supreme Court did, it avoided meeting the constitutional issue and set itself up as the final arbiter as to who can raise a constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.798" offset="3050559">That is a prerogative of this Court as to what citizens of the states can raise the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.878" offset="3078875">The Supreme Court cannot avoid it and this Court must accept that.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.364" offset="3100818">In other words, it has done indirectly what it did not want to do directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.718" offset="3122239">Now, on this appeal, there are three principle questions raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.110" offset="3143764">One is the constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.173" offset="3156093">The second is the admissibility of the statement in evidence during the trial and the third is a question as to whether the Supreme Court of New Jersey could properly review as non-judicial act in which it participated.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.237" offset="3224325">The first question is squarely within the jurisdiction of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.781" offset="3242506">It meet all -- meet both factors as required by Title 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.427" offset="3265076">The second question is so intertwined with the first that it cannot be separated because if the first question, if an answer to the first question the Court finds that the statements were involuntary then it naturally follows that the admissibility of those statement in evidence was depravation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.139" offset="3367894">The Court -- third question we concede is not within the appellate jurisdiction of this Court but it is of such significance that it could be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.721" offset="3414288">The second and third questions can be considered because they deny of federal right and if the first question is a properly -- with it properly within the appeal jurisdiction of the Court then because the other two questions are of real substance and have denied a federal right then they can be considered by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.822" offset="3498611">Lastly, as far as jurisdiction is concerned in the even this Court should decide that the first question is not within the appeal jurisdiction then the appellants rely on Section 2103 of the Code which provides for certiorari in matters where the -- in themselves would be subject to certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.227" offset="3588263">I now leave the question of jurisdiction and I turn to the principle question of argument today and that is the constitutionality of New Jersey's statute 2 (a) 8117.1.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.841" offset="3646777">This case challenges the use of the statute to extort or extract so-called voluntary statements from defendants and at this time I want to read to the Court the warning which was given to the defendant Holroyd.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.164" offset="3756074">The Deputy Attorney General prefaces remarks as follows and I'm reading from page 10 of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.159" offset="3783973">Question, All right, under a Supreme Court order dated the 20th of June 1961, I have been directed to investigate irregularities in the handling of municipal court vehicle matters in the borough Barrington and how they have been handled by the court and local police departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.287" offset="3872475">As a result, I have asked you to come here today so I may put questions to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.222" offset="4116250">Answer, Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.029" offset="4116146">Question, I want you to fully -- to realize fully however, any answers you give must be voluntary without any coercion, threat, or promise of reward and those answers may be used against you or any other person.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.898" offset="4116041">You have a privilege to refuse to disclose any matters which might tend to incriminate you.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.352" offset="4115937">However, if you make such a disclosure, you thereby waive your right or privilege in relation to any face of this investigation in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.476" offset="4115832">Now, we get to the pertinent part.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.680" offset="4115728">Under our laws, as a police officer, you are subject to a statute which provides however if you exercise this right or privilege a proceeding may be instituted against you to have you remove from office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.743" offset="4115623">Knowing all of these, you're willing to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.262" offset="4132446">I think the courts of this case rest in the Supreme Court of New Jersey's finding that this was a type of compulsion which could be legitimately used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.483" offset="4193259">And here the Court is admitting that compulsion was used and question that to be answered is, has this Court or the Fifth Amendment privilege or the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of Due Process ever acknowledge any degree of compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.176" offset="4272044">In other words, can the privilege at the whim of the court by declaring degrees of compulsion nullify this privilege?</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.721" offset="4322304">I don't believe that the compulsion of any type can be tolerated by the Fifth Amendment nor do I believe and is recognized just like the Fifth Amendment does not distinguished between race, creed, or color, social standing or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.099" offset="4415718">I know that the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General in giving the statement probably felt that he was giving to those defendants information concerning the laws of the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.897" offset="4474964">But one thing that he did was mislead them to the extent of saying you may be subject to a proceedings to have you removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.944" offset="4515192">There is no room in the statute for a may or maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.693" offset="4534105">The statute is not permissive, it is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.309" offset="4548629">It says shall be removed and the State of New Jersey and two of its own --, the Supreme Court of the State of New Jersey and two of its own cases, Lava versus North Board of Education and Lowenstein versus North Board of Education has interpreted this statute to be mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.170" offset="4628041">Both of the cases are cited in the briefs so I won't give the citation but I'd like to read from the Lava case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.720" offset="4654268">And this involved a fitness hearing on a school teacher by the North Board of Education and the Supreme Court in reviewing the applicability of this particular statute to that proceedings it says, it does not of course restrict the preexisting power of a supervisory school authority to conduct an inquiry in to the continued fitness of a teacher but seemingly has the additional effect that if during the course of such an inquiry there's a refusal to answer which falls within all the pertinent terms of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.942" offset="4811107">Then, dismissal is mandatory and in the law in Lowenstein case which was decided some four years later in 1961 and which likewise had the question of a teacher's dismissal of conduct unbecoming a teacher the Court commented and interpreted its own decision in the Lava case and in comment on the Lava case the Court held the inquiry approach was premised on the obligation of a teacher to respond fully without any right to rely on a constitutional privilege.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan B. Handler</label>
            <text syncTime="2340.575" offset="9465710">That is correct and the New Jersey Court stated in effect that the advice or warning given by the Deputy Attorney General was merely reflective of the intrinsic duty in the laws applicable to police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.509" offset="9521403">And I want to point out to the Court that in reading the warnings given by these -- to these various appellants, my adversary of course reads the warning given to Mr. Holroyd and which the Deputy Attorney General says that under a statute he may be subject to removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.025" offset="9619519">With respect to each of the other appellants, he merely stated that as a police officer under the laws you may be subject to a proceeding to have you removed from office with respect to Mrs. Naglee, now deceased, of course no warning whatsoever was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.694" offset="9686183">Moreover, more than a year later when the investigation was being conducted by the county prosecutor, the assistant prosecutor didn't mention the possibility of removal at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.383" offset="9760893">Now, the gist of the case in accordance with the New Jersey Supreme Court's decision is that this advice or this warning was reflective of the law applicable to police officers and as such the warning was reasonable, it was fair and it was accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.184" offset="9844067">And therefore will lead to an analysis as to whether if this warning was reflective of the law applicable to police officers whether that law itself is valid and sound and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.627" offset="9897880">And I don't think there can be any question for this Court and I don't think the appellants so urged that a police officer who was asked to cooperate or testify in the course of an official proceeding relating to his official duties is under a duty to cooperate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.898" offset="9974993">Now, none would quarrel that it is a primary function and duty of a police officer to detect and prevent crime and such detection of course involved disclosure and if a police officer fail to report or disclose the commission of a crime involving third persons everyone would have to agree that this would be a horrendous dereliction of duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.653" offset="10069974">And it would be equally so if the crime have been committed by a member of a policeman's family.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.709" offset="10098186">As a matter of fact recently in the State of New Jersey, we had a situation where a local policeman had to arrest his nephew with respect to a homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.783" offset="10138520">And so there is this transcending duty on a part of a police officer to make whole disclosure to detect crime, to report crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.677" offset="10178121">Is there then a carved out exception with respect to fulfilling this duty when it comes to a police officer himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.921" offset="10215006">When he himself has been involved or suspected as having been involved in the commission of a crime and of course I think the answer follows that merely because a police officer individually is involved, he is no wise redeemed of his official duty to disclose crime and to cooperate and to testify if this is part of what is necessary to prosecute crime effectively.</text>

            <text syncTime="2625.917" offset="10607052">It turns on whether or not the duty to cooperate, the duty to disclose crime and once possible implication in crime is an inherent part of the function of the particular public employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.149" offset="10659924">Now, of course appellants understandably lost over any possible distinction between a police officer and a private citizen and they retreat to the generalities that the Fifth Amendment applies to everybody and therefore it should apply uncritically to everybody regardless of the circumstances and regardless of the context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.204" offset="10748217">I don't think that's so when there are decisions that have held that with respect to grant of particular types of privileges.</text>

            <text syncTime="2797.616" offset="11293863">And so, the statute in that sense to the extent there was involved in the Lava case has been given this construction and this interpretation by the New Jersey Supreme Court and of course it is the statute as understood and construed by the state court which is persuasive of this Court's view of the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.849" offset="11386755">And in this case itself, the Court stated without particular reference to the statute that a policeman may be subject to removal for refusal to answer question and an official proceeding relating to his official acts but he can only be so removed in an appropriate proceeding with the opportunity to be heard and if it is disclosed as a result of that proceeding that his failure to testify and cooperate just speaks of a want of fitness to be a policeman.</text>
