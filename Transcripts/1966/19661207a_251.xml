            <text syncTime="7.389" offset="132890">Mr. Greenberg, you may continue your argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="9.665" offset="141981">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.161" offset="152012">When the argument concluded yesterday, I was discussing the confession issue and had just completed describing the background and the – what this petitioner is like which is one of the things that this Court examines in going to the question of whether a confession is coerced and I was doing that in connection with the State Supreme Court’s treatment of Jackson v. Denno and in which the State Supreme Court said among other things in distinguishing Jackson v. Denno from this case that there was no issue of voluntariness to be tried and we submit that in the contrary that there was indeed an issue and that that issue could be resolved in favor of the petitioner on uncontradicted testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.749" offset="354408">I pointed out that this petitioner was indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.194" offset="364126">He was ignorant that he finished the third grade only at age 17 or 18 that he could not read or write except his name and he didn't know the year that he was born.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.312" offset="412609">He knew that his father was dead and did not know when he'd died and so forth and I've read from the record colloquy with the petitioner which indicated his inability to understand even ordinary common phrases including a good number that had been attributed to him in the so called confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.232" offset="504351">Now, this is the man of whom we're talking and I now like to say what happened to him and shortly following arrest, he was taken to the office of Dr. Jackson for examination and his alleged statement said that there were bloodstains on his clothing and Dr. Jackson helped remove this clothing from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.837" offset="602676">There is some dispute about the vigor with which Dr. Jackson did this but no dispute at all that Dr. Jackson played a part in removing his clothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.459" offset="637158">He was brought there by state police and there were seven or eight state troopers on the premises at that time and they were in uniform wearing guns and I'd now like to read a few lines from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.126" offset="691911">Question, “What happened to you Isaac?”</text>
            <text syncTime="149.198" offset="700165">“Well, Dr. Jackson some one knocked me down and kick me over my eyelid and busted my eye on the right side.”</text>
            <text syncTime="155.677" offset="726079">“Did anything else happen to you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="157.761" offset="734438">“And he grabbed me by my private and dragged me on the floor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="163.486" offset="757321">“Did he drag you by your private on the floor?”</text>
            <text syncTime="165.788" offset="766516">“Yes sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="166.399" offset="768920">“Did it hurt you a lot?”</text>
            <text syncTime="167.928" offset="775084">“Yes sir, pretty bad.”</text>
            <text syncTime="169.468" offset="781249">Now, I'd like to point out that this particular statement is never contradicted and was never gone into cross-examination and it was something that was repeated at a subsequent state of the proceedings later on in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.972" offset="831300">Neither Jackson or any of the seven or eight police officers who are present and presumably were available to the state and indeed Dr. Jackson testified, he was available to the state beyond doubt, ever contradicted with this particular charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1204.998" offset="4923329">He went through that day step by step by step but Dr. Jackson's office was sort of sandwiched into a sentence and he went from Toledo to Waycross and there was no examination of that even on cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.564" offset="4977664">Now, we submit that in the Pikes (ph) case, Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out a standard and we feel should apply to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.630" offset="5009847">There is quote on page 37 of our brief, which is that, it is common ground that if this record had disclosed an admission by the police of one truncheon blow on the head of the petitioner, a confession following such a blow would be inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.751" offset="5074422">In the Stein case, quote in the brief also, essentially, the same standard of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.793" offset="5110575">Its slight evident, even inquisitive testimony that defendants injury occurred during the period of detention or at the hands of the police or failure by the prosecution's to meet the charge with all the reasonably available evidence might well have tipped the scales of decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.959" offset="5175254">He even hear it without force if there were any evidence whatever to connect the admitted injuries with the event of a period of interrogation but there is no such word in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.415" offset="5213080">Now, I would like to say that on the Jackson v. Denno point that Sims' charge and Sims' statement about what happened to him in the office at the pretrial hearing was at no point contradicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.131" offset="5255920">So far as the evidence on that is concerned on the pretrial hearing when the trial judge ruled, all he had was Sims' testimony about being kicked and dragged around the floor in the doctor's office and at that point, we didn't even have Dr. Jackson's testimony in denial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2445.150" offset="9883982">The question that Mr. Harlan, Justice Harlan asked yesterday about the statistics, those statistics were not put in the record but they’re all found at page 29 of the brief of respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.133" offset="9931943">With respect to the question of the Chief Justice the denial by Dr. Jackson that he kicked or that he struck the petitioner is found at pages 204 to 205 of the record as I will point out later, there was no denial or affirmation of the other part of the charge of mistreatment concerning the dragging incident, but he was not asked either on direct on cross about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.225" offset="10048240">As far as the procedure on the confession, Dr. Jackson testified first and that's in page 189 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.949" offset="10075199">He was called by the state for the purpose of testifying to the condition of the victim.</text>

            <text syncTime="2932.242" offset="11832299">Now, at the trial, the petitioner renewed his motion to exclude this confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.891" offset="11862915">It was admitted with respect to the republication of the written confession on Monday following the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.635" offset="11889873">The counsel for petitioner initially objected to this testimony on the ground that the proper foundation had not been laid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.533" offset="11917458">The counsel for the state there upon proceeded to make, to lay the foundation and this time, the testimony was admitted without objection and that's at page 239 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.391" offset="11960926">They made a motion for a new trial preserved the objection to the original written confession introduced during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.128" offset="11991855">The Bill of exceptions was signed overruling the motion to suppress but in no way on the record, is there any challenge against the -- what I refer to is spontaneous declaration to the turpentine workers nor to the republication of the written confession on the Monday following.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.888" offset="12074924">The written confession of April the 13th is attacked primarily on the ground that the procedure utilized by the courts below did not meet the requirements of Jackson versus Denno in providing a fair hearing in which both the underlying factual issues and the voluntariness of the confession should be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.199" offset="12156217">The first response that we make to this is that such a hearing was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.110" offset="12175862">Petitioner's counsel assisted in affording it by filing the motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.547" offset="12197595">A full hearing was held, the testimony of the petitioner under oath, the testimony of the two officers that had anything at all to do with the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.015" offset="12235421">This has never been done before in Georgia on a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.737" offset="12250363">The procedure in Georgia has universally been for an opposite to take the stand, and the court to swear him, for the counsel for the state to ask him, “Did you have a conversation with the accused concerning him whether or not he committed the crime?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.401" offset="12305011">“Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.543" offset="12309504">“Before he -- you had this conversation, did you make any promises to him?</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.636" offset="12325909">Did you make any threats or hold out any hope of reward or inducement?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.936" offset="12343150">And then after those -- and those questions or -- were pounded in the presence of the jury, the jury is not excluded and the court does not in the past hear all of the evidence relating to the confession but only the foundation questions from the particular witness who was then testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.538" offset="12413576">So this was a distinct departure from the Georgia law, a procedure that had been hitherto followed in our state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.594" offset="12449729">But the only thing as I see it which the trial court here did not do which perhaps it should have or could have done, and I am not certain in reading the decisions of this Court in Jackson versus Denno, as well as Boles versus Stevenson that it is necessary for the court, for the trial judge to read into the record an explicit finding of fact on the question of voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.780" offset="12546487">That was not done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.262" offset="12556413">We take the position that regardless of whether it was or it wasn't done that it's harmless because in view that we take of the evidence relative to the confession, it was not in conflict and that it required a finding of voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.137" offset="12615868">Now in this respect, the undisputed evidence shows the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.905" offset="12634990">The offense occurred around 10 o'clock in the morning, Saturday, April the 13th on a country road near St. George in Charlton County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.755" offset="12670412">Following the assault, the accused left the scene of the crime, his car wouldn't run and he walked down the road in the direction toward a Negro settlement referred to as Toledo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.517" offset="12713462">About 2:00 or 3:00 p.m. later that date, these two Negro laborers noticed petitioner upon being asked whether he had attacked that White woman, petitioner replied that he had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.695" offset="12762154">This statement was made before petitioner had ever been taken into custody, before he had been confronted by anyone in authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.876" offset="12790888">As petitioner started to leave, one of these workers effectuated a citizen's arrest, turned him over to a Mr. Stokes around 3:30 who in turn delivered him to Sgt. Sims and trooper Peacock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.802" offset="12850552">These officers carried petitioner to Dr. Jackson's office in Folkston for the purpose of examining his clothes to determine the presence of any miniscule strains of having been established that the victim was in the last days of the month of period at the time of the assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.109" offset="12915858">Petitioner testified while he -- while he was at the doctor's office, the doctor knocked him down, kicked him and dragged him over the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.691" offset="12946160">On the other end, Dr. Jackson denied that he was kicked or beaten.</text>

            <text syncTime="3576.955" offset="14411212">There was no persistent questioning, there was no protracted questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.340" offset="14424691">It was taken on the same day that he was arrested approximately seven hours after his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.399" offset="14460949">As far as the testimony about being advised that he had a right to see a lawyer, the petitioner did not deny that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.520" offset="14485504">He said that he could not recall on that issue one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.998" offset="14499401">That's at page 137 and 140.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.396" offset="14508910">Also, contrary to the brief, what he said in the brief of petitioner, there was a testimony that he was advised that he did not have to make a statement and that's at page 104 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.159" offset="14563976">Therefore, what we have is this that the petitioner confessed initially after having been in jail an hour or so or at least it was incriminating admission, during a casual conversation, he was in the cell and the officer was on the outside which he called to the officer himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.121" offset="14631894">The written confession was given approximately four hours later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.804" offset="14646627">Interrogation lasting about 30 minutes at the most.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.748" offset="14662405">In his own testimony at the trial, the petitioner slipped up after stating that the sheriff had called him and asked him about signing a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.846" offset="14698768">He first said that he didn't remember signing it but then he immediately corrected himself and said that he didn't know what he was signing, that's at pages 135 and page 248.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.650" offset="14745997">On cross-examination, he admitted that the statement was read to him and that he signed it because it was right, that's on page 141.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.838" offset="14782673">It's not the slightest evidence that we submit that this confessions made in the jail were anything but voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.068" offset="14807646">To hold otherwise you have to disregard the petitioner's own testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.352" offset="14828753">So therefore we say that even assuming arguendo that your decision in Jackson does require that the trial judge make an explicit statement into the record as to his findings of fact that in any such failure here was harmless.</text>

            <text syncTime="3758.922" offset="15139088">We further submit that the same testimony refutes the contention of the petitioner that the confession was involuntary as a matter of law because it was secured by the coercive circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.602" offset="15189765">Now the fact if the trial judge also submitted this confession to the jury, does invalidate it if the previous determination by the trial judge was itself sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.924" offset="15243055">The Georgia Supreme Court has held perhaps along the lines of the -- by Mr. Justice Black's dissent in Jackson that the issue as to the voluntariness of a confession is one of the fact issues of a case as to which the accused is entitled as a matter of right under our state constitution to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.104" offset="15319751">Under the Georgia law, there's no such thing as a directed verdict of guilt to a permeable case and we have a statute that we call the door mat that strictly prohibits the trial judge from communing in extent upon what has or has not been proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="3819.225" offset="15380250">Consequently, at the juncture of this confession, the trial judge was prohibited either from failing to submit it to the jury with appropriate instructions or else from spading to the jury his opinion is to what he had found and this is where I think the Supreme Court of Georgia got [Inaudible].</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.003" offset="15459349">The Supreme Court of Georgia's decision, page 338 of the record, seems to and what I consider, I hope my interpretation is correct to confuse what this Court held in Jackson versus Denno.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.388" offset="15512952">The Supreme Court of Georgia seems to be saying or assuming that Jackson versus Denno requires that the trial judge advise the jury of his independent determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.164" offset="15556002">I do not so -- I do not construe Jackson versus Denno to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.676" offset="15574079">I think that that's necessarily implied in the opinion insofar as you expressly approved the Massachusetts rule under which the issue is determined by both the judge and the jury and that is what we submit that the trial judge did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.324" offset="15636668">Of course whether or not there was a compliance with Jackson versus Denno, is a federal question for this Court and not for the Supreme Court of Georgia to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.341" offset="15672717">Supreme Court of Georgia seem to assume except for the undisputed evidence aspect of it that would not have been in compliance with Jackson versus Denno except for these three factors that Mr. Greenberg touched on which I won't not deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.857" offset="15742830">That brings me to the challenge as to the standards that were used to determine voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.390" offset="15776893">The charge complaint of essentially was a code section that's been the law of Georgia many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.359" offset="15800822">The judge instructed the jury that they were not to consider the confession that it was to be received with caution that a confession alone uncorroborated by other evidence will not just file conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.522" offset="15845439">To make a confession admissible, it must have been made freely and voluntarily without being induced by the slightest hope of benefit or the modus fear of injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.391" offset="15884936">That charge if anything we submit is more complete than just a simple test of voluntariness that this Court enunciated in the Gallegos versus Nebraska decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.004" offset="15927359">We submit that the charge did not limit the jury to considering just mere direct threats and open promises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.791" offset="15970513">The court -- this Court has not yet held that a State Court must give a trial jury, a resume of it's holdings and all of the factual circumstances, the myriad situations that ever risen and tell them that they may consider all of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.928" offset="16039058">That has never been held and in fact you held just to the contrary in Lyons versus Oklahoma which has held at the question as to how specific a charge to the jury on an issue of confession must be primarily a question for the State Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3999.159" offset="16099976">Rogers versus Richmond, that does not hold anything to the contrary and simply holds it where it is seen that the trial judge both in his determination and in his instructions to the jury, considered the probable reliability of the confession as one element in determining it's voluntariness if that was erroneous as a matter of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.875" offset="16198823">The specific question raised by Mr. Justice Brennan about the implications to be drawn from a denial of the overruling of the motion to suppress would be precluded against petitioner in the Culombe case at 367 U.S. of 603 - 604 if that is still the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.916" offset="16287013">We next wish to address a few remarks to the contention as far as Escobedo was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.953" offset="16311150">We think that this case is distinguishable from Escobedo.</text>
            <text syncTime="4055.854" offset="16326823">Here, the petitioner was expressly told that he was entitled to a lawyer and he said he didn't want one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4062.263" offset="16352423">He testified himself at the trial under oath that he remembers the sheriff telling him that anything he said could be used against him and not only that he never requested a counsel, he expressly declined it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4074.839" offset="16402683">He was also told that he didn't have to make a statement as I previously stated and that's on page 104.</text>
            <text syncTime="4080.323" offset="16424626">The evidence does show that he had only a third grade education but if you read his testimony as a whole other than you get to the places where the manufactured testimony about can you define or do you know what is meant by constitutional rights about being advised about your rights, he responded very well to the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.437" offset="16493171">He handled himself in a perfect manner that indicated he knew what is going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.481" offset="16533295">Now in Escobedo of course, there the accused requested counsel and it was specifically denied and following that a confession was taken that is not to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4120.804" offset="16586585">As far as the jury selection procedures, we think that the evidence shows this that even assuming that this evidence as to the prior jury list had come in and had been admitted and even assuming that it had created -- carried the burden at most evidence of prior jury list can establish as a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4143.868" offset="16678849">It cannot conclusively establish discrimination as to this particular jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4149.412" offset="16701001">It creates a prima facie case shifting the burden to the state to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="4153.912" offset="16718973">We think the evidence here shows that there had been a revision just prior to the trial of this case in the Spring of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="4162.466" offset="16753246">There was one Negro on the 19 men Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4165.273" offset="16764426">There were nine Negroes on the 99 summoned for the Traverse jury and at least four of these nine were put upon the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4175.026" offset="16803506">He so alleges at page 321 in his amended motion for new trial and the trial judge certified that which thereby established that as a fact and this is between – stated that only three were put upon him but they allege in their motion that four and that's been approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.675" offset="16874036">Georgia law as we will deal further in the Whitus case, I do not oppose to argue the issue about the tax digest in this case because the same thing comes up in the Whitus case, but Georgia law limits jury service to tax payers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.417" offset="16933073">In this respect, the Negroes constituted 20% of the tax payers in Charlton County with 411 Negroes to 1548 White people, but of the 691 non-White persons in Charlton County, 25 years of age or older, 302 were functionally illiterate according the census bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="4228.387" offset="17016874">We think that the Negro representation on the jury here compares favorably with that it was upheld in Swain versus Alabama and Brown versus Allen and then regardless of whether the trial judge did or not err in excluding this evidence, the most that it would have done would have established the prima facie case in that the evidence as to this particular box -- that we submit, overcame in such a prima facie showing.</text>
