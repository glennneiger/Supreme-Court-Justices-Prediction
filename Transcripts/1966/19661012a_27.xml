            <label>Mr. Joseph Forer</label>
            <text syncTime="9.205" offset="140204">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.447" offset="157132">This case arose as a proceeding under the Maryland Post-Conviction Procedure Act which is a statutory substitute for habeas corpus and coram nobis.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.211" offset="204257">The petitioners who were serving life sentences and are serving life sentences following the commutation of death sentences challenged their conviction for rape under the Act on constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.068" offset="267682">The first question that I will argue is whether the conviction of the petitioners was obtained in violation of due process by reason of the prosecution suppression of material evidence favorable to the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.494" offset="337377">And for that purpose, I must first give you a condensed summary of the evidence which came out at the petitioner's criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.635" offset="381889">The petitioners are brothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.890" offset="394951">On the night of July 20, 1961, they were swimming and fishing in the Patuxent River near their home.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.757" offset="430373">As they left the river with the companion Joseph Johnson, they encountered 500 feet from the river in deep woods an automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.343" offset="480737">In that automobile were two people, a 16-year old girl named Joyce, and a 21-year old man Stewart Foster.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="103.998" offset="519398">What time of the night was it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="105.605" stopTime="407.594">
            <label>Mr. Joseph Forer</label>
            <text syncTime="105.605" offset="525772">This was late at night close to midnight.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.302" offset="548551">An altercation started at the car between the Giles brothers and Johnson on the one hand and Stewart Foster on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.426" offset="585122">The testimony is in conflict as to what caused the altercation and who provoked it and for present purposes, I'd not go into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.125" offset="627858">But very early in the altercation, at the time when James Giles and Johnson threw some stones at the car, Joyce ran out of the car and into the woods along the side of the dark road.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.932" offset="695150">According to her testimony, she ran a distance of 30 feet at which point she stopped because she said she was out of breathe and she had fallen.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.672" offset="746036">John Giles soon afterwards left the car while the altercation was still going on to come back into the woods and came upon Joyce.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.568" offset="797654">The two of them were together there for approximately 10 or 15 minutes during which time they had some conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.692" offset="834121">Joyce herself testified that she was the first person to introduce the subject of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.150" offset="864005">In that she offered John Giles to have intercourse with him if he would help her get away.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.131" offset="903920">John Giles also testified to that offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.837" offset="918758">But he gave it a little more body, he testified that she also explained to him that she was on probation and couldn't afford to get caught in the woods and didn't want to get in any trouble and for that reason she was anxious that he help her get away.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.482" offset="997334">After they have been quietly in the woods together for a while.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.210" offset="1016247">The altercation of the car ended when Stewart Foster was knocked out and then ran off.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.526" offset="1041429">The other two young Negroes, Joseph Johnson and James Giles, came into the woods along the same path and they came upon John Giles and Joyce.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.792" offset="1090539">At this point, there's a very serious cleavage in the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.108" offset="1107780">Joyce testified that the three men were there and that each one of the three they're after having intercourse with her.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.499" offset="1157413">She testified that she did not resist, she testified that she made no outcry, she also testified that she made no remonstrance.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.356" offset="1192835">She didn't even say to them, “Please let me alone.”</text>
            <text syncTime="275.698" offset="1206209">She also took off her own clothes.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.501" offset="1213419">This was her own testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.132" offset="1219897">She said she submitted this way because she was frightened.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.292" offset="1240586">The Giles brothers testified that as the two who had been delayed came along the path, Joyce called them over saying to John, “Well I know what you boys want.”</text>
            <text syncTime="298.792" offset="1298578">Then she called them over and said, “I know what you boys like” and then urged them to have intercourse with her.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.442" offset="1325119">She took off her own clothes, she was the stage master of the affair.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.064" offset="1343613">She directed the order of intercourse.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.837" offset="1354689">And then the course of this transaction, she told them that she had had 16 or 17 other boys that week and two or three more wouldn't make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.088" offset="1403695">She told James Giles that she was in trouble, and that if she were caught in the woods, she would have to claim that she was raped.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.700" offset="1450193">She repeated to John Giles that she was on probation and that if she were caught in the woods, she said she would have to claim she was raped.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.369" offset="1488854">According to the testimony of the Giles brothers, John Giles refused the invitation of the intercourse, the other two accepted the intercourse.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.162" offset="1524067">At the trial, on redirect examination by the state, Joyce was asked if she was in fact on probation at the time of this episode.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.754" offset="1570356">She denied that she was on probation and thereafter on cross examination of the petitioners, the State very effectively ridiculed their testimony that she had told them that she was on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.149" offset="1635976">At the trial, the Giles brothers being indigent or represented by court appointed counsel. Joseph Johnson, the third man in the affair was also indicted but he got his case severed and transferred at Orlando County and he's not in this case although it's an open secret that his faith abides this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="439.061" offset="1859584">The Patuxent River is the border line between Montgomery and Howard and they were on the Montgomery County side.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.547" offset="1885602">Now, the trial started one day December 4 and it ended the next that's from the choosing of a jury for the jury verdict of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.007" offset="1923427">The only defense witnesses for the petitioners with the technical and academic exception that the defense counsel also called two of the policemen and they tried unsuccessfully to get them to admit that Joyce had originally told the police that she was even raped by two men rather than by three.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.386" offset="2016946">They denied it and the only listed to help defense, the whole thing was a factless maneuver because Joyce had already admitted that she had originally told that to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.780" offset="2070444">The case went to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.229" offset="2076296">It was a conflict between credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.729" offset="2094268">This all white jury had to decide whether to believe this 16-year old white girl or these two young Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.762" offset="2130422">And the story that these two young Negroes gave was the most implausible story.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.508" offset="2149439">It was that under these rather frightening conditions, the 16-year old child solicited intercourse with three Negro strangers.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.490" offset="2189354">For the jury to believe their story, they would have to find that this 16-year old child was incredibly wanted that she was probably mentally disturbed and there was no evidence of either condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.399" offset="2240972">They would also have to believe that this girl who was not on probation went around intuitively telling people that she was on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.357" offset="2276812">The jury found them guilty and their story didn't impress the trial judge, Judge Pugh, very much either because although under Maryland law, he had a choice of sentence from 18 months they day he imposed to that sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.360" offset="2348805">These two brothers were at that time aged 20 and 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.427" offset="2369076">Joseph Johnson didn't feel any better in this trial at Minneapolis.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.917" offset="2391019">After the appeals were exhausted on November 16, 1962, 11 months after the verdict, a new trial motion was filed on behalf of the petitioners alleging the newly discovered evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.379" offset="2464893">The circuit court denied this motion without even looking at the newly discovered evidence on the ground that the motion was filed too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.386" offset="2504913">They said under Maryland rules if you want to file a motion for a new trial on the base of newly discovered evidence you have to file within three days after verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.644" offset="2545977">This ruling was affirmed by the Maryland Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.347" offset="2572727">Subsequently, in October of 1963, Governor Tawes commuted the death sentences of the three men, that is, for two petitioners and Johnson to life.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.305" offset="2620583">This post conviction proceeding was filed about six months after that in May of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.012" offset="2651408">It was heard in the circuit court of Montgomery County though before a different judge than the sentencing judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.604" offset="2677739">And after an evidentiary hearing, the circuit court found that the petitioners had been denied due process by reason of the fact that the prosecution had suppressed material exculpatory evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.969" offset="2755271">The state appeal and the Court of Appeals reversed -- the Court of Appeals heard the case en banc and they reversed five to two.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.023" offset="2795499">And that then we came here.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.082" offset="2803649">Before I get into a discussion of the evidence which came out at the post conviction trial and a description of the evidence that we claim was suppressed, I would like to mention a couple of the legal issues that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.173" offset="2864044">The legal issues in the suppression point all arise out of one sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.809" offset="2886614">They all arise within the framework of one sentence over the Court's decision, 1963 decision in Brady against Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.188" offset="2924126">And in that case, the court said and I quote, “We now hold that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.”</text>
            <text syncTime="733.521" offset="3037497">Now, in that case, the qualification of on request is explainable by the fact that in that case, the evidence which had been withheld had been requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.508" offset="3089429">In fact, none of the lower courts which have passed on suppression cases have ever made a requirement that the defense had to request the information before the nondisclosure could be excused.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.098" offset="3167796">And this is true of cases which were decided before Brady including two Third Circuit cases which Brady cited with approval of stating the correct rule and two of cases cited after Brady and it was true in this very case.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.948" offset="3231117">In this very case, the Maryland Court of Appeals did not require a showing of a request for disclosure and it is perfectly obvious that the -- if you -- a requirement of a request would defeat the rule because the time when a defense needs disclosure the most, is when the defense is so ignorant and so uninformed that it doesn't know what to request or even whether to request.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.109" offset="3343757">So for the future purposes, I shall assume that the Brady rule applies without the need for a request for the exposure abiding the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.592" offset="3397778">That brings me to the second requirement of the Brady case and that is that the withheld evidence be material.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.838" offset="3438738">And Brady didn't explain the meaning of the test of materiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.931" offset="3467055">The Maryland Court of Appeals didn't explain it either but if you analyze what they did, it is perfectly clear that they held that evidence is immaterial unless it were so strong that as to be full through.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.774" offset="3530480">If there was any possibility that it might not have affected the result then it wasn't material.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.900" offset="3554931">Now, it seems to us that the analogy here should be to the test of materiality which this Court develop in cases like the Napue case where the fault was the introduction of testimony known to the prosecution to be incorrect and the failure of the prosecution to correct the incorrect testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.896" offset="3659003">And the tests stated by this Court in the Napue case was that the evidence, the wrongful -- the admitted evidence, was material and tainted the conviction if the false testimony, “May have had an effect on the outcome of the trial” and the Court has applied the same tests to cases where evidence where illegally obtained evidence and violation of the Fourth Amendment was admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.045" offset="3791600">So in they against Connecticut, the test was whether the admission of the evidence -- there was a reasonable possibility that the admission of the evidence might have affected the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.426" offset="3845099">Now, this kind of case is a corollary case to the use of false evidence and it seems to us clear that the same test of materiality should apply namely if the evidence if the evidence have been revealed, was there a reasonable possibility that it would have affected the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.963" offset="3935274">In our view, this test of materiality was more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.818" offset="3954604">And now I come to our description of the evidence that we claim was suppressed and which was brought out at the post-conviction proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.136" offset="3991907">The evidence falls under two categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.598" offset="4005804">The first category is evidence of the events between the episode the alleged rape of July 20, 1961 and the trial in December 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.761" offset="4058467">The evidence shows this, on the 9th of August 26, 1961, one month after the alleged rape, three months before the trial, Joyce went to a party, and at the party she had intercourse with two men; one in the bathroom, one in the yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.557" offset="4149582">Early the next morning, she took an overdose of drugs and a suicide attempt and she was taken to a hospital and was kept in the hospital in the psychiatric ward of the hospital for 10 days with admitting diagnosis of a psychopathic personality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.042" offset="4239548">While she was in the psychopathic ward of the hospital she was visited by a boyfriend of hers named Busty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.075" offset="4271626">Busty asked her why did she attempt suicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.656" offset="4293987">She told Busty that she had been raped the night before the suicide attempt by these two men that whom she had had intercourse at the park, and she gave him the names of the men and all the detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.232" offset="4348322">Busty reported this rather officiously because she didn't ask him though.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.790" offset="4374549">Busty reported this to her parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.311" offset="4392626">Her mother first called sergeant way up in Montgomery County police who was in-charged of the investigation resulting in the conviction of petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.026" offset="4435466">And she told Sergeant Whalen that Joyce had been raped again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.133" offset="4451871">So Whalen asked her where did this take place and she said in Prince George's County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.682" offset="4470053">So Whalen said well don't bother me, tell it to the Prince George's County police and presumably he went back to sleep.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.224" offset="4500250">So she or her husband reported it to the Prince George's County police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.900" offset="4522924">Detective Sergeant Wheeler of the Prince George's County Police came to the hospital to interview Joyce in connection with this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.852" offset="4570781">When he interviewed her, the first thing she told them was that these two men at the party had had relations with her against her will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.614" offset="4609860">But he then questioned her further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.261" offset="4620413">In the course of the questioning it became perfectly apparent that she had not been raped, that she engaged in voluntary intercourse, she had put up no resistance and that the most she had was an unexpressed mental reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.449" offset="4689168">She really didn't want to engage an intercourse with these two boys at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.385" offset="4708916">She said at that particular time because she was afraid that if all the other boys at the party got to know about it, they would all insist on having intercourse with her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.152" offset="4744025">Otherwise, she said she wouldn't even have had this mental; reservation, and she also admitted that in the past with one of the two men with whom she have had intercourse at the party, she had had relation with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.495" offset="4809331">They were white.</text>

            <text syncTime="1242.530" offset="5073481">Joseph told them that on numerous occasions she had engaged in oral settlement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1253.860" offset="5118830">Now, to get to Justice Black's question, these episodes and these are episodes within the first category for purposes of the precedence and the evidentiary question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.408" offset="5177031">It seems to us that this is narrative account to have four components.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.228" offset="5204302">First is that she made a false accusation of rape against somebody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.520" offset="5229484">Secondly that she attempted suicide and incidentally at the post-conviction proceeding and psychiatrist testified that this of the 16-year old girl was itself indicative a serious mental disturbance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.443" offset="5281102">Third, she was hospitalized in the psychiatric ward and, fourth that she had a sex history indicative of nymphomania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.617" offset="5317883">Now, the authorities numerous authority dealing with sex cases in various jurisdictions hold even in the abstract that any as to each one of these four components that they are admissible in evidence where there is a defense of consent because they are indicative of the mental illness of the prosecutor and because they are indicative of a well-known syndrome which involves as a characteristic element, a compulsion on the part of a young girl to contrive sex offenses by men.</text>

            <text syncTime="1432.731" offset="5834271">In another ground of materiality here, is that with this kind of information, it seems to us that defense could have applied for and would have received a pretrial mental examination of the prosecutor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2102.378" offset="8512867">And furthermore, as the evidence of the post-conviction proceeding showed, in fact she did call it probation because on the Saturday before the Thursday of the alleged rape by the petitioners, she went out with a boyfriend of hers Pat Stevens and she told Pat Stevens let's stay in Laurel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.448" offset="8601161">Let's not go down to Hyattsville because I'm on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.963" offset="8615267">And in fact, she wasn't on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.405" offset="8628955">She was in this near probation status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.674" offset="8646092">This evidence, the materiality of it can possibly be controverted because it would have corroborated critical testimony of the petitioners which I believe obviously negatives rape and it would have removed a false impression created before the jury by the cross-examination of the defendants and by the state's witness' denial of being on probation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2461.639" offset="9949915">They knew there was a second rape accusation which apparently was false and they had very good reason to believe that Joyce have instigated it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2473.367" offset="9996831">But I want to go further, there's another grounds for materiality here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.730" offset="10014281">Not only would this evidence have been enough in and out itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.852" offset="10034761">But if you assume as the Court of Appeals of Maryland did that there is a duty to divulge anything that is possibly material and that this duty was breached here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.224" offset="10088260">Once you have a breach of a duty to divulge, then when you get to the question of whether the breach of the duty was prejudicial, you're past the question of breach which means whether or not the evidence was material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.548" offset="10149595">Then you should look, not only at the value of the precise things known to the prosecution and not divulge but also at what the defense was in all likelihood and in years surely would have discovered if the duty had not been breached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.474" offset="10237262">If Kardy and Whalen had told the defense what they knew, any diligent defense would have checked with the police department of Prince George's County and would have gotten the whole story that Lieutenant Wheeler had knew and would have had everything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.299" offset="10308524">And this was a point made by the dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.510" offset="10321377">The dissenting opinion said, in order to determine materiality, first, what they actually knew was itself material, but secondly that having breached the duty of divulgence of disposure that this information was material because of -- it would have been a great value for the defense by further investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.871" offset="10418866">Now, we have an alternative theory for -- on the question of knowledge, this is an alternative theory with regard to category one of the suppressed evidence that is the history of the false rape accusation and the attempted suicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.135" offset="10491904">But it is the only theory that we have with regard to the nondisclosure of the fact that she was in this near probation status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.456" offset="10545194">We say that under certain circumstances for the purposes of the suppression doctrine, it is right to charge the prosecution, not only with what they actually knew but also with constructive knowledge of what they should have known if they had conducted an unbiased investigation and if they had shown the most rudimentary diligence in the performance of the obligation that they owe to the state as public officials and to all accused to investigate allegations of crime with some kind of elementary diligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3779.075" offset="15219649">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.302" offset="15240547">Because all of the importance really of the facts of this case I think because of the gloss which the petitioner's counsel has perhaps put on those facts that should be reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.570" offset="15309615">We have to keep in mind that what we're talking about number one is information known to persons in two counties of the State of Maryland we're talking about information number one known by the state's attorney Leonard Kardy of Montgomery County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.395" offset="15376906">We're talking about information known by Lieutenant Whalen the chief investigator of this case who was also in Montgomery County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.468" offset="15409194">But the most important information known is the information known in this case by Sergeant Wheeler of the Prince George's County police.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.195" offset="15448168">The other most important information in this case also Prince George's County information is located number one, in the Prince George's County hospital record; and number two in a juvenile court record of Prince George's County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.951" offset="15515146">Now, the basis of our brief really is that this case has got to analyzed in proper perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.546" offset="15549524">The first thing that has to be ascertained is what did the prosecution includes know, or what is the prosecution charge for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.318" offset="15592678">Who is the prosecution?</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.848" offset="15602813">Now the Court of Appeals of Maryland found even a more broad rule that has been announced in the past, the Court of Appeals said that the prosecution would consist in this case of Kardy the state's attorney and his assistance and the police of Montgomery County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.164" offset="15684002">Now, notice that is the police of Montgomery County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.717" offset="15702288">We argue that information known not only by Kardy in this case by perhaps known by some other officer in Montgomery County even under the Court of Appeals opinion could be said by the defense analogy in this case to be imputable to the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3920.820" offset="15786611">Now, we maintain that our own Court of Appeals was even too broad that what should be known by the prosecution should be the knowledge of the state's attorney and additionally the knowledge of the investigating officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.909" offset="15859022">Now, we maintain that if the rule is any different, what -- where are we going and what does it mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.243" offset="15888384">Now, Montgomery County has a population of approximately 500,000 people the same with the other adjourning county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.845" offset="15926732">Or let's look at Jersey City, New Jersey, and let's look at New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.052" offset="15943555">Is every police officer of either of these adjourning municipalities jurisdiction to know number one, who are to be the state witnesses?</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.682" offset="15986082">Who has made a complaint of crime and is to testify in the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.082" offset="16003741">Are all state or municipal police officers to know that fact much less whether or not any particular piece of information that they might have would be useful if they don't know the facts of the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.283" offset="16064554">Much less, what, excuse me -- much less whether a particular piece of information that they might have about a witness what if you tell what it would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4001.923" offset="16111052">So therefore, we claim that the only legitimate rule which can be passed, the only practical test of prosecution knowledge can be that of actual knowledge of the prosecutor and his assistants and his agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.682" offset="16174059">And secondly, of those officers that investigated the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4338.888" offset="17458970">The course came out with an odd statement that the prosecution should be charged with knowledge of the state's attorney and his assistants and of the police department of that jurisdiction which has the control or the jurisdiction to hear the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4361.335" offset="17548727">And that in the next sentence, they said, this would mean applying to this case that our interest is in the knowledge of the state's attorney Kardy and of Lieutenant Whalen who were the only or Whalen was the only Montgomery County officer actually involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4380.054" offset="17623542">Now, I would like to point before getting further into the legal argument of this case that the state's evidence was not solely the evidence of Joyce Roberts against the evidence of petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4396.681" offset="17690102">And our case was not an uncorroborated case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4400.916" offset="17707029">The evidence was clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4406.706" offset="17730226">This Joyce Roberts only 16 years old did go out to Patuxent River area at midnight.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.870" offset="17766902">And she went out there with three boys.</text>
            <text syncTime="4419.677" offset="17782053">But the evidence is clear that she went there to go swimming and others were to meet them there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.942" offset="17807130">That when the others didn't come within minutes, they left.</text>
            <text syncTime="4431.443" offset="17829177">Joyce Roberts and the three boys started to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="4436.418" offset="17849031">Their car then ran out of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.176" offset="17860106">Two of the three boys out with Joyce Roberts in that car left to get gas, leaving Joyce Roberts and Stewart Foster in that car.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.306" offset="17896573">It is at this point that the Giles boys who had been swimming and fishing came upon the scene and they saw the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="4457.039" offset="17931577">And of course this is where the evidence becomes conflicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4461.191" offset="17948087">The Giles boys testified in the trial that the reason that they broke into that car, the windows were locked -- the windows were closed, the doors were locked.</text>
            <text syncTime="4470.302" offset="17984554">But the reason why they shattered those windows of that car and drags Foster out of that car and not being conscious was because they claim that Stewart Foster had a gun in that car.</text>
            <text syncTime="4482.709" offset="18034186">Now here is Stewart Foster in that car, Joyce Roberts in that car and here are three persons that are opposed to this one other man.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.236" offset="18072325">Now, the complete and credulous proposition that was forwarded by the defense just didn't support the proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4503.459" offset="18117256">So you have a demolished car to corroborate the state's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4507.697" offset="18134183">You have Stewart Foster found at two o'clock in the morning by the first police officer who arrived on the scene, you find him bloody, you find him hysteric, you find that he's taken and rushed to the hospital and given eight stitches.</text>

            <text syncTime="4557.042" offset="18331564">The police officer and Stewart Foster had to pick Joyce vilely up off of the ground and help her get dressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4567.028" offset="18371480">She was taken to the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="4569.198" offset="18380152">Now, was there any evidence in the hospital record, of any force?</text>
            <text syncTime="4574.259" offset="18400423">Well, the answer is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.700" offset="18414216">The doctor testified for the state at the trial that there were operations of the shoulders, of the legs, and of the neck of the prosecuting witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4587.618" offset="18453817">They further testified that there were leaves, there were dirt and grass adherent to the back of her body.</text>
            <text syncTime="4593.820" offset="18478686">There were numerous spermatozoa cells found in the vagina.</text>
            <text syncTime="4598.683" offset="18498121">Now, we maintain that this is not a case of uncorroborated testimony of a prosecuting witness which has served now to place three persons in jail that the state's case was fully corroborated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4613.163" offset="18556008">Now, the prosecutor knew this evidence ahead of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4617.476" offset="18573249">In addition to that, the prosecutor spoke to and interviewed Joyce Roberts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.704" offset="18598222">He spoke to her before the Giles case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4626.417" offset="18609089">He spoke to her before the Johnson case which was held there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4631.472" offset="18629256">He had an interview with the defense counsel, Mr. Steven Prescott.</text>
            <text syncTime="4637.639" offset="18653915">He told the defense counsel that as far as he was concerned, this girl was 100% that there was nothing as far as he knew that would cast any aspersions whatsoever on her credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="4651.053" offset="18707623">Now, the Court of Appeals of Maryland found that by the Giles version of this incident to their own counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4658.445" offset="18737194">Their own counsel must have known, number one, that this girl was a sexually promiscuous girl and that her background was not of the finest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4672.429" offset="18793096">There was evidence in other words which the defense counsel knew wherein the Court of Appeals said which should have been investigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4681.709" offset="18830190">Mr. Forer has named certain things the defense of the case was that Joyce Roberts had told these defendants that she had that same week engaged in intercourse with 16 other persons.</text>

            <text syncTime="5681.852" offset="22830791">Now, the reason that that was transferred to Montgomery County and we point that out in our brief is that subsequent to the date of April the 4th when this initial Prince George's County petition was sought, Joyce Roberts and her family had been subjected to gross harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5704.197" offset="22920129">The mother had requested Lieutenant Whalen to have her placed in protective custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="5710.141" offset="22943953">And Lieutenant Whalen called the judge of the juvenile court of Montgomery County and told the judge of that court that this girl is to be a necessary witness in the state's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5722.488" offset="22993272">A hearing therefore was held in Montgomery County and it concerned therefore the original facts contained in this stipulation plus the fact that the state wanted her held for her own protective custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="5737.201" offset="23052204">And that's why the hearing was held in Montgomery.</text>

            <text syncTime="5795.240" offset="23284381">But they were treated as distinct cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5797.364" offset="23292844">The Giles brothers is one case because a severance had been asked as far as the third party was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5804.703" offset="23322206">So, if I might continue that what we're talking about here then is not only a question of uncorroborated testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="5817.465" offset="23373197">But a grossly clear picture drawn by the state is to what occurred on that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="5823.860" offset="23398797">Now, very briefly, we maintain that other than the question of the utility of information which is the only rule which Mr. Forer suggests as the court contests that there are many, many other factors in this case to be given very serious consideration before any one rule can be made to be imposed upon the states under the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5848.812" offset="23498585">Consideration has got to be given as I pointed out number one, what did the state know or what was the state chargeable with knowing?</text>
            <text syncTime="5857.263" offset="23532440">Consideration has got to be given, we maintain, to what did the defense know or what was the defense chargeable with knowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5864.999" offset="23563368">Now, as relates to the evidence itself, consideration must be given not only to usefulness of that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="5873.406" offset="23597014">Consideration must be given to the admissibility of that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="5877.836" offset="23614673">Again, to the discoverability of that information under existing rules of discovery and inspection available in the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="5886.884" offset="23650931">Now, Maryland Rule 728 which is said out in this petition is broader than Federal Rule 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="5893.959" offset="23679248">Under neither rule would any of these evidence have been discoverable in a manner of pretrial discovery had it been requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="5903.360" offset="23716864">Now, we state that this is a very important factor to be determined along with the mere question of possible usefulness of this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="5913.119" offset="23755839">It's discoverability.</text>
            <text syncTime="5914.741" offset="23762317">It's availability.</text>
            <text syncTime="5916.097" offset="23767751">Now, was this evidence merely cumulative or impeaching?</text>
            <text syncTime="5919.828" offset="23782693">Now, if it was so, it would not have been material exculpatory evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5927.113" offset="23811845">And finally, was the evidence contradictory of anything that happened in the trial?</text>
            <text syncTime="5932.859" offset="23834833">The answer is no. The evidence was not contradictory of anything that happened in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5937.766" offset="23854477">Now, the only aspect that Mr. Forer can point to trying to show some semblance of contradiction would be the fact that Joyce Roberts denied that she was on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5949.909" offset="23902960">However, the stipulation at the time of the trial and prior thereto she was not on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5958.956" offset="23939218">She never was on probation and still -- and is not now.</text>
            <text syncTime="5964.246" offset="23960325">So there is no contradiction of any trial testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="5968.776" offset="23978506">So we maintain that before a rule can be passed in this case that the state must disclose not only what it knows but what it maybe should find that very careful consideration has got to be given to these other factors, to what the state really knew to the question of due diligence and equal availability of this knowledge to the defense to the question of the admissibility of this information to the question of whether the evidence could have been discovered even had it been asked and note finally that in the Brady case, one of the questions or one of the prerequisites to relief was that a request for information has to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="6013.661" offset="24158020">Now, our Court of Appeals as I have already pointed out showed that these defendants must have known -- must have known of the character and reputation of this girl or at least had something that it should have gone and investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6029.531" offset="24221445">Now, we maintain sir that no case has ever held so far as we now that unless the state has exclusive knowledge of information that the defense knows that and that is the exclusive knowledge of information within its own control that is equally available to the defense counsel that a suppression has been maintained under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6054.082" offset="24319666">Now, we maintain that the Fourteenth Amendment imposes not so broad an obligation as that which is sought here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6062.331" offset="24352684">We say that the Fourteenth Amendment does say that a prosecutor is to prosecute with earnest and as vigor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6068.837" offset="24378702">You have said that in the Burger Case and we maintain that what the prosecution is precluded from doing by the Fourteenth Amendment is not from becoming a partisan but by having his partisan should turn into impartiality to become impartial to the extent of being disequal of to the extent of being desized.</text>

            <text syncTime="7958.801" offset="31938539">I will be mindful of the fact that we have overstayed the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="7961.617" offset="31949824">I was -- I would develop what argument I could make it within an abbreviated period of time that it will be brief and somewhat abortive.</text>
            <text syncTime="7970.591" offset="31985768">The second one of the petitioner relates to the Maryland's former practice where all the -- which limits the trial motion for three days including on any go round, including newly discovered evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="7984.599" offset="32041775">My brother challenges that on the basis of the Fourteenth Amendment and says and that seems that the state has required to provide to condemn persons a reasonable opportunity presumably through a due trial mechanism demonstrate their innocence on the basis of newly discovered evidence that the Maryland rule of three days simply was not reasonable, was lacking in fundamental fairness and a classic due process terms that is shocking to the universal sense of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="8012.824" offset="32154624">We say in response to that Your Honor is that due process does not require a new trial and that where a state grants a new trial, it may impose such time limitations on the availability as it sees fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="8027.450" offset="32213138">We don't here maintain the three days is reasonable or unreasonable and I might add, that's no longer the Maryland Rule, we now have the 90-day new trial motion for newly discovered evidence but this Court has enunciated the principal proposition many years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="8045.776" offset="32286490">Mr. Justice Holmes in the case of James versus Appellant, 192 U.S. in 1904 decision he said subsequently and very briefly in three sentences and with the Court's permission, I will simply quote that on this particular point, “We no more can doubt the power of the legislature to enact that statutes of limitation or motions for a new trial and we can doubt its power to an access of statute for the bringing of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="8073.526" offset="32397458">It may be a questioned whether there would be any constitutional objection to a law making the original judgment final and doing a way with new trial altogether.”</text>
            <text syncTime="8082.640" offset="32433925">Re-hearings, new trials are not essential to due process of law either in judicial or administrative proceedings cited in earlier case of this Court, Railroad Company versus Bach as in 154 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="8095.467" offset="32485230">That proposition remains the law of the land as I understand it Your Honor of course the new rules of the court both state and federal and federal rules of criminal procedure setting forth time limitations on new trials that are now with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="8111.293" offset="32548551">We -- the former rule of the expiration of the term of Court has a cut off period for new trials is no longer the law but there have been cases of this Court where individuals sought to avail themselves of new trials after the 5-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="8127.621" offset="32613857">This Court has said, this is a matter of power of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="8131.189" offset="32628172">You must do it within the period specified or not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="8135.743" offset="32646353">Again, I say the question of the power of jurisdiction there is not due process requirement involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="8141.725" offset="32670281">My brothers seem to suggest that -- apparently seek to utilize a due process clause here as a vehicle to create power or to enlarge power as we say of course they are being held constitutional predicate for a new trial here.</text>
            <text syncTime="8158.423" offset="32737050">The State of Maryland's limitation of three days although it may appear unreasonable is not unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="8165.413" offset="32765053">There is a second point perhaps more difficult, the equal protection argument of my brother, basically amounts to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="8174.384" offset="32800893">As Your Honors know in Maryland the jury is the judge of the law and the fact in the criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8181.162" offset="32828061">From that predicate, the intention is made that the Maryland Court of Appeals has denied the petitioners in this case equal protection of the law when they substituted their judgment for the exculpatory value of the alleged rape claim, the alleged suicide evidence for the determination that may have been made for a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="8203.406" offset="32916982">They say in essence that we have picked out a specie of case and have applied a different standard to this type of case and we would do any other case we violated around the principle and the principles of due process and equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="8219.597" offset="32981765">We say to that of course that the predicate to make that argument a rational one is that the Maryland Court of Appeals had indicated that the evidence of question was admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="8230.079" offset="33023666">It did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="8231.802" offset="33030562">The Maryland Court of Appeals held that the evidence of the false rape claim and of the suicide attempt was not admissible so that the equal protection argument falls right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="8244.243" offset="33080299">It requires a bottom of admissibility of the evidence before it can be utilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="8251.313" offset="33108616">I think what my brothers had in mind was the fact that the Court of Appeals, fortuitously perhaps stated that even if this evidence were admissible and nevertheless it wasn't of sufficient exculpatory value to be -- to give rise of the application of the suppression doctrine for that we say it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="8269.529" offset="33181445">This was a Post-Conviction Procedure Act proceeding with which I am sure Your Honors are familiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="8275.226" offset="33204328">We have that Act in Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="8277.656" offset="33214046">That is a civil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8279.837" offset="33222719">This was not a trial of criminal case but many of that in Maryland and all our Post-Conviction Procedure Act case there is no jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="8287.297" offset="33252603">The judge determines all relevant matters of fact and law.</text>
            <text syncTime="8291.147" offset="33267963">Suppression cases are treated like any other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8293.826" offset="33278725">The voluntariness case for example of a confession, the trial judge makes all relevant determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="8300.592" offset="33305788">We haven't treated suppression cases any different than we treat any other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8305.346" offset="33324805">It's not a violation of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="8310.342" offset="33344763">If I haven't made myself clear in this brief time I'm talking rather fast but we would say this as Your Honors recall in Thomson versus (Inaudible), you said in essence that substantial allegation of newly discovered evidence where all of these available in a federal habeas corpus setting that if such allegations are made and incumbent upon a trial judge to have a hearing to determine whether or not this newly discovered evidence would furnish a predicate for a constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="8345.093" offset="33483734">You also said that the newly discovered evidence which merely goes to the question of innocence or guilt is not grounds for such a hearing and in other words I think the essence of what you've done was to reaffirm the proposition that a new trial was not an essential reading of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="8361.974" offset="33551235">But you haven't slammed the door and said that you can't do anything with this newly discovered evidence or whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="8721.801" offset="34990582">Furthermore, among the new evidence that we sought to get a hearing on was a great mass of evidence in addition to the evidence that we claim suppressed including evidence relating to Stewart Foster and the accounts given by Stewart Foster after -- immediately after this alleged rape which would have served to corroborate the testimony of the defendants that they would not the aggressors.</text>
            <text syncTime="8751.388" offset="35108968">They did not provoke the altercation and we were never able to get that new evidence in because of the Maryland three-day rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="8759.396" offset="35140942">Now, we're not claiming that the evident information that was suppressed proves innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="8767.236" offset="35172289">But what we are saying is that the information was of a quality that the defense should have had the opportunity to present that or the fruits of the information to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="8780.290" offset="35224534">And it wasn't up to the prosecutor to decide whether or not this kind of evidence should be given to was at least he could have done was leave it to the judge as to whether the jury should pass on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="8792.499" offset="35273331">And now, at this late date, the Court of Appeals says he probably breached his obligation but the evidence wasn't sufficiently exculpatory and in that respect, the Court of Appeals is invading the providence of the jury which in Maryland law is the sole judge of the exculpatory value of admissible evidence and in that respect, we were denied equal protection under all the opinions in the Brady case.</text>

            <text syncTime="8830.785" offset="35426513">Mr. Needle also states the Maryland law very seriously when he says that there would not be admissible under Maryland law the fact of a prior false rape claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="8845.026" offset="35483460">In Smallwood versus Warden which was a case by the federal district court of Maryland which is quoted in our brief, Chief Judge Thompson granted habeas corpus because of a suppression of a prior rape accusation where there wasn't even evidence that it was false.</text>
            <text syncTime="8865.758" offset="35566425">In this case, neither the majority nor the minority adopted his theory that this evidence is clearly been held inadmissible.</text>
