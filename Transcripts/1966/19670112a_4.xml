            <text syncTime="42.334" offset="272697">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.975" offset="275310">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.674" offset="294118">This case has a long history to it and that it's necessary to go into it to understand why we are here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.321" offset="320658">It was in November 8, 1956 that there was an agreement between El Paso and Pacific to exchange stock and it was on May 1, 1957 to that exchange agreement was completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.909" offset="367052">It took a mere seven months to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.145" offset="379904">And on July 22, 1957, the United States Government filed a complaint charging that that stock acquisition violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.715" offset="418252">Now despite warnings from the Department of Justice in the State of California that this merger proceeding should be halted.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.445" offset="449181">Nonetheless, the EL Paso Company and Pacific Northwest went to the Federal Power Commission and asked that this merger be approved and it was approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.033" offset="487528">Now, that was on December 31, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.709" offset="514173">There was an appeal from that in a California versus the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.709" offset="534235">This Court set aside the approval by the Federal Power Commission saying that the trial in Utah should have preceded first.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.462" offset="565269">Now the trial in Utah went forward, Judge Ritter found there was no violation of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.182" offset="588152">It came to this Court and this Court found that there was a violation of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.970" offset="607274">Now, we are here under the Doctrine of the General Motors case that this Court having given a mandate to Judge Ritter to the best without delay has not left the mandate of this Court and we are here as a proper party in a proper way urging that the divestiture be set aside at once.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.595" offset="685746">Now, that the divestiture plan requires three years before El Paso will writ itself of Pacific Northwest and this is after they go to Federal Power Commission and seek a certificate of approval from that agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.185" offset="752097">And this is hardly a divestiture without delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.071" offset="767666">Furthermore, El Paso is not making a complete divestiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.896" offset="786996">It is keeping certain properties of its own favorable to itself and is giving Pacific Northwest properties less favorable to that company.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.671" offset="826075">For example, it is keeping the West Coast Transmission stock which is a valuable asset which should be given a Pacific Northwest but El Paso seeks to retain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.536" offset="865468">California sort to intervene or deny this for other appellants here and we are here as we say under the theory of the General Motors case that this Court has the right to review the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.806" offset="910608">Now, when you said that this should be done without delay, we do not concede that a certificate proceeding like the Power Commission and other three years to rid itself of Pacific Northwest is in keeping with the concept without a delay?</text>

            <text syncTime="234.971" offset="1043205">But this was after the Supreme Court of the United States in USA versus El Paso found that Section 7 had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.779" offset="1078523">This was not a consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.600" offset="1085733">This was a decree for divestiture after the Government had won the case and it was agreed to by the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="259.303" offset="1140590">The Government opposed the El Paso plan for divestiture from the outset of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.249" offset="1164413">If proposed originally that this matter be disposed of by selling the properties of specific Northwest Pipe Line outright to third party purchasers and it even brought forward three prospective purchasers whom it said were competent, qualified, willing, and able to buy the properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.215" offset="1240273">And the judge was not interested in disposing the properties in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.789" offset="1254484">And it seems to me that one quick and clean in simple way to divest these properties and divest them completely is to sell to competent, qualified, third party purchasers.</text>

            <text syncTime="523.910" offset="2198967">We think that California was entitled to intervene simply because of the facts that the representation of the public interest by the Government abruptly seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.905" offset="2238986">The case was tried upon the theory that the El Paso divestiture plan was deficient and the Government so specify, its so argued, its so briefed, it put in a proposed decree on its own which called for an outright sale the third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.794" offset="2302516">Now at that point, if you agree with us that the Government seized to represent the public interest which would include California and would include the mandate of this Court then we have a right because of the inadequacy of the representation to become a party to protect our interest on the interest in this case so far as California is concerned as the gas consuming public and the necessity of our competition for the natural gas pipeline market of California.</text>

            <text syncTime="597.981" offset="2495300">A man can make a mistake honestly and a government official such as myself can make a mistake honestly.</text>

            <text syncTime="607.330" offset="2532707">Now, what was the mistake here?</text>
            <text syncTime="610.168" offset="2543992">When this was argued in 1962 in California versus the Federal Power Commission, the Solicitor General standing before you said, that they were seeking out there in Utah, complete divestiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.465" offset="2593207">That's what the complaint asked for.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.597" offset="2601775">That meant that you have to give back to the new company as you constituted it, sufficient gas reserves as it once had to be competitive to the California market.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.919" offset="2643048">That you have to return to it, the West Coast Transmission stock which it owned, which was with value of asset to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.721" offset="2670216">That you had to leave alone the gathering charge in the San Juan Basin rather than increasing it and that El Paso when you said divest must divest completely all that it take in Pacific Northwest and not keep the favorable proper producing property which it has done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.286" offset="2740537">And in 20 minutes, I can't go into particulars of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.432" offset="2753076">But that's the kind of divestiture decree which came out.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.024" offset="2767496">Now, I'm not charging any malfeasance or fraudulent conduct upon the part of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.045" offset="2799574">I'm saying if the Government failed to follow the mandate of this Court, and to follow the language of United States of America versus El Paso Natural Gas Company where you said there was a necessity for competition that the acquisition of the Pacific tended to lessen that tenancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.210" offset="2864253">And you said, put it back in a position where it can still compete for the California Market.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.920" offset="2883062">Now that so constituted today that it's less competitive than it was, and it was independent, you're mandate is not been met and the Government as you said in the General Motors case has won the lawsuit but lost the cause ultimately and that's what is happening here.</text>

            <text syncTime="762.071" offset="3151705">That you said in du Pont that where you had formulated a judgment and remanded to the District Court that you have plenary power to supervised that judgment and that if it were brought back to your attention in a proper way.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.265" offset="3200397">You had jurisdiction to take the cause over if the decree were not issue as you had contemplated it should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.723" offset="3226311">Now of course, it's our position the decree does not meet the mandate of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.605" offset="3241775">It's our position we're here in a proper way.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.790" offset="3250552">It's our position that we don't need to reach the question of intervention under Rule 24 that we're here under the Doctrine of Continental and du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.449" offset="3281168">But if we do have to come before this Court as party, we maintain that we were entitled to intervene because when the Government abandoned its antitrust position before Judge Ritter and went for the decree of El Paso Natural Gas Company at that moment, the representation of the public interests, the mandate of this Court, the interest of the United States of America and the consumers of California that interest became inadequate and somebody was entitled to represent those parties in a particular California was entitled to representation, therefore, its gas consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.961" offset="3419199">Now, we have to wait throughout the trial until such time as the Government switched positions before we knew that the representation was inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.442" offset="3457128">And when they use the word “inadequate” or “failure to meet the mandate” whatever term you wish to style it, it was not, what this Court said you want it done when you said restore Pacific to a competitive position for the California market.</text>

            <text syncTime="915.711" offset="3766209">And as I see the Court is aware there have been difficulties in this case before as California is position is concerned and I can't talk about the merits of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.348" offset="3800795">But the decree as agreed to by the Government sets up a new corporation weaker than Pacific was when it was independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.412" offset="3841024">It is nothing but a delaying tactic.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.762" offset="3854399">It will take two or more years to get through the Federal Power Commission and then and only then does the stock exchange at El Paso proposed attempt to be done with its own shareholders and if that fails a public offering.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.982" offset="3903300">And against that, merely think of the fact that the Government at one time said, the best way to dispose of this and to make it independent is an outright sale to third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.092" offset="3943737">And this selling in an existing pipeline is something like selling in existing bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.104" offset="3959829">There will be no difficulty in doing that and this Court then has to be very specific in its instructions to Judge Ritter and I prefer you send it to a Master as to what he must do and as to how he must do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.901" offset="4006954">And there's must be some time limitations put upon it because I question very much that I will be back before Judge Ritter if this is remanded for further proceedings, I think this Court has a challenge presented to it by the violator of the Clayton Act, El Paso as to whether or not your mandate is to be respected or as to whether or not there version of what compliance that your mandate means.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.334" offset="4096711">There's a clear challenge here as I view it and I think the Court is being tests as to whether or not we've won the case but lost the cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.549" offset="4129520">And I think you have it within your power to enunciate quite clearly if Judge Ritter with some strict guidelines and limitations as to what he must do if you dissented there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.544" offset="4165569">You see there is so many unanswered questions in this case because we were not allowed to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.205" offset="4184168">Questions about gas reserves, capital structure, why they're keeping the West Coast Transmission stock which was a valuable assets to the new company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.733" offset="4218337">Why the new company only has $250.00 of working capital?</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.444" offset="4233174">Why it has a capital structure 75% debt and 25% equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.635" offset="4253863">All of these things were resolved in chambers or by the Government but nobody else was allowed to participate and the Government in its brief concedes this is a complex difficult question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.882" offset="4302869">But it's gotten to be difficult complex situation at is because El Paso persisted despite repeated warnings in violating the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.972" offset="4339231">And this violation of the Clayton Act has being going on now since 1956 and it goes on as I stand here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.521" offset="4369429">And the California market requires and the west requires that you restore Pacific to what it wants once when it was able to compete with El Paso for the California Gas market and even made negotiations of Edison to bring gas to Southern California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.387" offset="4428884">And when that occurred, El Paso came in and made a very much better attractive lower offer just to keep Pacific out of California Gas market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.222" offset="4464306">El Paso has selected the management of this company for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.822" offset="4478621">El Paso is picking the best assets for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.157" offset="4491995">El Paso is presenting to the Federal Power Commission, the case on behalf of a new company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.842" offset="4510699">It's financing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.019" offset="4515401">It's preparing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.849" offset="4518745">It's presenting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.906" offset="4523029">Now, compare that against a group of fires wherever they maybe I'm no expert in finance who would bid for this company and would go in before the Power Commission and make an adversary showing against El Paso.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.442" offset="4573184">The same attorneys, the same people that put this merger together are now presenting the application of a new pipeline company to the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.836" offset="4606725">Let's not calculate it to suit the best public interest as I see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.490" offset="4625324">It will be at least five years before this merger is concluded unless this Court directs that some prompt action be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.450" offset="4669210">And the best way I know of doing it is to do as the Government once said in its proposed decree which was lodged but not filed for some reason, invite deeds from interested third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.310" offset="4712573">Now, I'm intruding upon Mr. Hooper's time, if unless the Court has any questions, I will conclude.</text>

            <text syncTime="1168.894" offset="4778924">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.371" offset="4808808">The interest of Southern California, the Edison Company, in this proceeding has recognized in the Government's brief on page 40.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.104" offset="4835767">Is that verging the restoration of a new company after the divestiture as it effective competitor for the California market, pursuant to the mandate of this Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.647" offset="4874010">It may be recalled that it's in 1964 decision ordering divestiture as this Court pointed out and I quote, “Edison search for a burned supply of natural gas in California when it had El Paso Gas only on an interrupt basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.758" offset="4926360">Illustrates what effect Pacific Northwest had merely as a potential competitor in the California market.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.747" offset="4958333">I might state the situation with the respect of the kind of service which we have through El Paso has not change from that situation that it existed at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.863" offset="4990830">This Court further observed after referring to the enormous gas reserves among others which Pacific Northwest had in the San Juan Basin in which was the principal area where the competition for gas supplies between Pacific Northwest in El Paso took place before the illegal merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.542" offset="5053524">This Court said, have Pacific Northwest remained independent, there can be no doubt it would have sought to exploit its formidable geographical position vis-à-vis California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.898" offset="5102947">Now the real substantive question as we see it before this Court is whether a plan of divestiture which was characterized by the District Court judge who signed the decree by the statement and I quote, “You see what this plan proposes is a division of the country, a division of the market, a division of the reserves one area to new company and another area to El Paso that is what the root of this plan is” and that's found at 976 of the record whether that kind of a decree complies with this Court's mandate ordering divestiture to dissolve the merger which it had determined to be violative of the anti-competitive -- of the antitrust laws because of its anticompetitive effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.934" offset="5299075">Now, on February 4, 1965, the date of the last hearing on divestiture other than the hearings that came after the stipulated judgment that followed sometime thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.325" offset="5344632">This root of the El Paso scheme was also recognized by the Government where Government counsel stated in part as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.212" offset="5380263">“This Company that is being set up under the El Paso proposal is if I may use the word, ‘straitjacketed' to serve the Northwest markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.966" offset="5423208">It is not in any position to serve the California markets with respect to an expansion program to the California markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.022" offset="5451421">The Company is not as strong as the company had been before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.532" offset="5465527">It is not as likely to be able to serve the California markets as Pacific Northwest was at the time of acquisition in this case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.649" offset="5501994">That's at the record 1355 to 1356.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.683" offset="5518085">Now, there is absolutely no difference whatsoever between the divestiture arrangement embodied in the decree signed by the District Court and the divestiture plan as previously proposed by El Paso.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.337" offset="5568763">In this regard that would in any way change the appropriateness of the characterizations which I have quoted as describing the decree.</text>

            <text syncTime="2276.796" offset="9210546">The case of a Cascade Metro Gas Company application, the first got started on October 7, 1965 with an application believed to intervene in a procedure for divestiture of the Pacific Northwest Pipe Line Division the El Paso Metro Gas Company and the District Court of Salt Lake City.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.258" offset="9316394">The -- ten days -- well, ten days later a proposal presented by El Paso for divestiture was filed and served in hearings commenced two days later and there -- there were number of other intervenors, commissions, private parties, applicants for intervention I should correctly say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.221" offset="9420257">Now the court ordered that all would be interveners file memoranda of evidence, law and argument supporting their contention on intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.877" offset="9482846">Now approximately 20 intervenors -- potential intervenors, Cascade Metro Gas Company alone, complied with the court's order, nevertheless, when the court reached the decision on intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.684" offset="9538121">It denied intervention to all parties by a form order which stated in part that no evidence written oral had been supported -- had been submitted in support of the application for intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.810" offset="9614608">And subsequently that court adopted as its decision on intervention, the brief of El Paso filed an opposition to the applications for intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.422" offset="9661106">Based upon that, Cascade Natural Gas Corporation filed notice of appeal at the termination of hearings and then approximately the same time that the Government filed a vigorous, well written brief in opposition to the El Paso proposal if anything to a greater extent then to -- then to then the extent to it Cascade itself objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.483" offset="9785344">Now, Cascade Natural Gas Corporation is what may be termed a growth company in the Pacific Northwest distributing natural gas in 1963 and that, correction, yes, 1963 to 1962 communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.250" offset="9844381">Three more added in early 1964 and had assets at that time of approximately of $43 million Rose Plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.171" offset="9884087">It had 40,000 customers by mid 1964 and it was completely and utterly dependent upon a supply of gas which had it -- it had obtained originally form Pacific Northwest Pipeline Corporation under long term contracts which were the basis for very extensive financing to the extent then of above $28 million and which were assumed by El Paso when the merger occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.789" offset="10022536">Cascade Natural Gas Corporation then did not have and it does not today, have any other source of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.676" offset="10058062">It must be dependent entirely on the makeup of the new company which is to be the product of the decree of divestiture as finally approved by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.988" offset="10131310">To Cascade, the fundamental issue in this case is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.146" offset="10159940">Is El Paso to be permitted to retain the fruits of its initial and continued violation of the antitrust laws?</text>

            <text syncTime="3208.828" offset="12938637">The -- the Government forced a concession on the question of spin off that the Government made it -- made a substantial concession itself throughout the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.711" offset="12982209">The Government argued for a sale, outright sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="3227.799" offset="13014601">The Government abandoned all other controversies which it -- all other considerations which have said were important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.008" offset="13043440">Now, to Cascade the matter of vital importance is does this decree reconstitute a company with a reserve position of the Old Pacific Northwest Pipe Line Corporation and we submit it falls far short of doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.160" offset="13136018">It -- it will create substitute a marginal company for a company that had five greater reserves and deliverability like in El Paso itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="3316.771" offset="13370493">At this time, I would like to address myself to the question of what course of action the Court might have follow in order to finally dispose of the litigation which is before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.326" offset="13416678">As you all I'm sure this Court is now before you for the -- this case is now before you for the third time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.232" offset="13448338">Criminal consumer interest standpoint as well as to comply with the mandate of this Court issued in the last time around.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.691" offset="13486164">We deemed it essential that this matter be finally resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.328" offset="13508733">In our brief, we suggested that a master to be appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.336" offset="13528691">At this point, I would like to even withdraw that suggestion since it would appear if a master is appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.477" offset="13557321">He would have to report somebody in further extend the duration of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.300" offset="13576547">And as I say it is not our view that it is in the best interest of the consumers Pacific Northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.325" offset="13604655">It is our view that to effectuate the final decree you got to do it yourselves, you got to provide firmly and finally directions to the lower court as to what shall be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.518" offset="13665468">We think the first step is the creation of a new amnesty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.262" offset="13684381">Now I don't, at this point wished to write-off the existing entity provided for by the decree of the lower court as a potential success or an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.968" offset="13727222">However, in the method of divestiture provided by the lower court does not in our opinion provide the creation of an independent entity within the contemplation of the Court's prior opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.190" offset="13788139">In other words, we don't believe that is it what you contemplate, it may be satisfactory for our needs but not for the needs of the mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.131" offset="13827845">Mr. Bennett is concern with the -- of will and ability to compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.865" offset="13854804">We are not as much concerned with the will to compete up in Oregon as we are ability because it has the ability to compete, it has the ability to serve its own markets which is now serving and that's us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.890" offset="13906944">Now, there is one suggestion that the lower court made of record it's at page 1,222 and that suggestion is that an adversary party to El Paso should be created which could be heard in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.896" offset="13970996">That suggestion has great merit in our view since if adversary appears in the Court which is capable financially of examining into these asset questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.703" offset="14026167">You should then be able to have reasonable resolution of fair and equitable distribution of the assets between the two companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.095" offset="14059708">That makes the divestiture help you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.468" offset="14073292">The next case of the decree which we have urged upon you is to accept that division of debt which is proposed by our El Paso.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.955" offset="14115192">That means a $180 million worth of long-term debt would be absorbed by the new company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.148" offset="14135986">But to reject without qualification, the provisions suggested or contained in the lower court decree that this new entity which is to succeed to the assets pay an extra or premium price on those bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.100" offset="14191783">In other words, they intend to raise the interest rates on those bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.457" offset="14205158">I see no justification for that and it's definitely at the expense of the consumers who did not consummate this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.377" offset="14244864">The next step would be the specific division of assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.789" offset="14262523">Now that's the third part that is largely covered in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.875" offset="14282898">We think that you should spell it out just as we have, just as other appellants have in briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.369" offset="14308812">So there can be no mistake in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.063" offset="14319574">What you're talking about is apparently there was last time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.595" offset="14333785">This would include not only division of assets but we're estimating pre-merger in their corporate dealings between the two corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.285" offset="14372551">There were two of them in particular which are concerned to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.432" offset="14389060">One of them is simple to orderly start that's the King's Gate Gas proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.865" offset="14410794">Here there is the assumed as common gathering systems as it now exist must be divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.029" offset="14435453">Now, that division because of the dispute in the Court should be prescribed specifically to include change in the contract as it was part of the merger to incorporate all pre or post merger additions and extensions of the common gathering system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.266" offset="14536391">Now, if a new company is created which becomes an adversary in the lower court, if you accept that premise, then it will be necessary also to lay down to definite guidelines for the Court, the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.640" offset="14609951">In -- in our view, there can be only one rational rule of distribution of assets and that's restoration of the pre-merger status quo, alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.088" offset="14655718">It was found by you that the merger destroyed competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.312" offset="14672645">If anything less than pre-merger status quo is now created.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.801" offset="14694588">There can be hardly be competition of this -- at the same level as it was at the time of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.019" offset="14723427">Another general rule which we advocate here and I can not really say that there's any precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.027" offset="14751431">There may be some direction but there are no cases on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.155" offset="14763969">And that is the principle that no wrongdoer should be allowed to profit from his own wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.500" offset="14789360">Now this means, if you give full effect to any simple concept if you use it, you have use it in a du Pont but I intend it abrogating extension of it to see that El Paso in selling the assets and the -- that's what will abrogate the sale of assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.603" offset="14873788">In selling them, it should have no pecuniary gain from the profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.020" offset="14891447">This rule is I say is without precedent, although, I think you can find trends in that direction in your case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.777" offset="14918510">However if implemented, it means that mergers or a merger applicants or those who contemplate merger from this day forward will have to look nor how much they can gain even if they got caught but whether not only will they be deprived of the property acquired by merger but also of the profits which they have gained during the course of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.366" offset="15020805">In this case we're talking about capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.449" offset="15033135">I think the current value for tax part -- purposes of the El Paso properties to be the best is to according to the El Paso exhibit in the lower court is a $187 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.846" offset="15082768">The book value of the equity portion not after allowance for $180 million of bonds is $63 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.115" offset="15119862">The market value according to the transcript, I'm sorry I lost the page, but the transcript indicates the market value currently is a $107 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.673" offset="15166046">Now that means there's approximately $43 or $45 million of profit, just based on the book.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.864" offset="15194781">Let alone for tax purposes which El Paso will have to arrive by reason of its wrongdoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.982" offset="15223306">We urge that when you provide, if you're willing to provide for sale of these assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.526" offset="15241488">The El Paso not be permitted to reach those ill-gotten gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.813" offset="15262595">This will give long term protection to the consumers not only in Oregon but throughout the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.489" offset="15289344">Finally, I would like to address myself to the question of Federal Power Commission jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.661" offset="15310033">As amicus, I think I'm agree -- entitled to agree with the other side everything on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.707" offset="15330200">The other side seems divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.392" offset="15336991">Oregon is in full to support of the El Paso contention of the Federal Power Commission has no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.600" offset="15365726">Once you have ordered of the divestiture and prescribe the terms of it or proved the terms as the case may be their Federal Power Commission has no jurisdictions to alter those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.978" offset="15419329">It must issue a certificate of convenience and necessity in accordance of the terms of decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.471" offset="15441272">Thereafter, it can be free to look into under corporate dealings, prices, rates, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.484" offset="15465305">So, we cannot at this stage, let for protection to the Federal Power Commission and this is another reason why we think that you must protect this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.974" offset="15503235">We can't let the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.425" offset="15513057">The Government takes an opposite view in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.243" offset="15524342">And perhaps others will take opposite views if the matter does reach the Federal Power Commission without a definitive statement by this Court on that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="4286.423" offset="17249050">And secondly, because of the somewhat different position apparently taken by Southern California Edison and California on the one hand as people who are interested in the ability of the new company to compete in California and Cascade on the other hand which seems to echo that argument, they also suggest the possible injury to itself as a purchase of natural gas I think would be appropriate to take up these two considerations separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.844" offset="17354794">And I think it would be helpful in my discussion if I could first deal with the question of intervention and when I get into the question intervention and touch on the show why the Attorney General's representation of the interest involved here was adequate I shall take up and discuss the various attacks that have been made upon the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="4330.967" offset="17427205">Now, let me first turn to Southern California Edison and California's claim to intervention as of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4338.848" offset="17458761">As the rule existed before its amendment last summer, the two possible provisions that may be relevant to subparagraph 2 and subparagraph 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="4349.029" offset="17499512">Subparagraph 2 permits intervention where the applicant may is or may be bound by the judgment and were the representation of its right where the existing party is inadequate.</text>

            <text syncTime="4368.725" offset="17578297">But let me come to the question of bound.</text>
            <text syncTime="4370.980" offset="17587284">We think it's very clear that under this Court's decision of the Sam Fox case a few terms ago, these people were not bound by this judgment because the teaching of Sam Fox says, that as the rule uses the word bound means bound in the res judicata sense and that you are not bound by the judgment, even though the practical effect of the judgment would be to make it more difficult for you to prevail in your action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4398.212" offset="17696266">Indeed, one of the reasons for the revision of the rule was a recognition by the revisers that it was rather difficult for many people to comply with.</text>
            <text syncTime="4406.965" offset="17731271">Now, the other sub provision of the rule states that you may intervene as of right where the applicant is so situated to be adversely affected by the disposition of the property within the control of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4424.782" offset="17802533">Now, we can see that in this case there is property within the control of the court within the meaning of that rule, the assets to be divested.</text>
            <text syncTime="4433.867" offset="17838791">But here we think their argument fails because they don't have any kind of interest in this property and again, it's well settled that in order to satisfy the standards for intervention as of right under subsection 3 you've got to have some kind of a property interest in the property under control of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4453.356" offset="17916844">They have no interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4454.599" offset="17921755">These people have no interest in the assets to be divested.</text>
            <text syncTime="4458.089" offset="17935757">What they have is a possible course of action against the El Paso for a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act and that again has been well said although it's not enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="5248.021" offset="21095424">The principal objection we had to that plan was that El Paso proposed to distribute the stock of the new company to the existing El Paso shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="5260.998" offset="21147355">In other words, what El Paso proposed to do was to create -- establish a new company and I might mention the new company has been created and of course the new company cannot act until it has been certificated by the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5274.528" offset="21201481">The new company has been created and the Federal Power Commission proceedings have been stayed pending the determination of this appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="5292.834" offset="21274728">We vigorously opposed this because we said this would not ensure a separation of the community of interest between the two companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.472" offset="21309210">Since they advise this merger as this Court held in its previous decision was that it for the possible competition of Pacific Northwest to serve the California law, we didn't think it would be a fair plan under which any strings were attached.</text>

            <text syncTime="5347.424" offset="21493112">El Paso ceded to us on what we thought was a principal defect of a plan that is the failure to ensure separation between the stockholders of the new and the old company.</text>

            <text syncTime="5420.878" offset="21786833">First, at the insistence of the staff of the Federal Power Commission, the new company has now retained independent counsel to represent it before that Commission, that's the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="5432.188" offset="21832077">Secondly, the Department of Justice fully considered that the qualifications of the new principle executive offices of the company, Mr. Clark, the new Chief Executive officer was fully examined before the District Court at the hearing and we were satisfied that he is a completely independent man and he was asked specifically in response to a question whether when the company is established, he would be a -- once he got established they would consider competing in all markets including California and he said yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5464.754" offset="21962376">So that's two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="5466.204" offset="21968227">Third, we think the separation of the stock as we have proposed it does create an independent entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5473.111" offset="21995813">This is a company that is -- will be free from the control of El Paso.</text>
            <text syncTime="5477.600" offset="22013785">Now it's admittedly -- it's going to take time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5480.066" offset="22023607">It's going to take time because these are very complex matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.972" offset="22039280">This is not just divesting a bakery or a shoe manufacturer, this is a regulated industry where before you can recreate the new company you have to meet the standards of the Federal Power Act and this is a complicated thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="5647.997" offset="22695372">That is the claim and then let me explain why although the Government originally espouse that position after further study of it retreated from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5656.090" offset="22727764">We studied the thing and looking back to the situation at the time of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="5663.200" offset="22756185">At that point the Pacific Northwest had almost signed a contract for this large supply of Canadian gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5672.320" offset="22792652">At that time also, Pacific Northwest was unable to use all of these gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5677.277" offset="22812505">Pacific Northwest was in a difficult financial position at that point it was doubtful whether it would have the funds fully to develop all of these reserves and it seem to us there was a very serious question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5689.063" offset="22859630">In the light of this whether in fact it can fairly be said that Pacific Northwest would have acquired these reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="5695.384" offset="22884916">Well when we examines this and the record indicates we talk in enormous amounts -- enormous figures of course when we deal with natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5705.226" offset="22924309">They are turning back, giving to the new company roughly seven and a half trillion cubic feet of gas by way of reserves which is 1.7 trillion more than Pacific Northwest had at the time of the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5721.357" offset="22988779">Now, if I may, I'd like to come back for a minute to what we think is the important question here which is this whole question of the right of the Attorney General to settle the case where he thinks he's federal off to settle the case than to fight the scene to litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="5749.828" offset="23102673">Well, we changed it Mr. Justice, all I can tell you is this, we changed it some time between the 23rd of February 1965 which is one of the proceedings we closed in District Court and the 24th of March, I'm sorry, the 24th of May roughly three months later when we filed this stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5774.864" offset="23202879">Now, let me explain what happened, when the Attorney General had to decide at this point whether to continue to press further for litigation or to accept this settlement of El Paso, they had a number of considerations to take into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="5789.491" offset="23261288">First of all, we had concluded perhaps we in error but it was our conclusion that the District Judge had evinced great sympathy for the El Paso plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5800.801" offset="23306533">And we were concerned that if we continue to fight this thing, a probable outcome was that the District Judge would adopt the El Paso proposed decree which of course far less favorable from our point of view than the decree that El Paso ultimately gave us.</text>
            <text syncTime="5819.558" offset="23381556">If he did the District Court would have do that it would mean one or two things, either the possibility of an appeal to this Court would still further delay in accomplishing prompt divestiture and the uncertainty is to whether or not this Court would reverse bearing in mind the District Court's large expression or just leaving the case there with a lesser decree than we had obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="5843.204" offset="23476224">In addition to that, the parties, El Paso yielded to us on what we considered to be the most serious defect in the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5857.233" offset="23532335">That is the failure to assure complete separation of the new company in El Paso.</text>

            <text syncTime="5887.843" offset="23654693">This Court had never faced the question whether a divestiture by which El Paso distributed the stock of Pacific Northwest to its stockholders was continued a controlling relationship so significant as to amount to a failure divested.</text>
            <text syncTime="5908.167" offset="23736090">That's the point on which they had ceded to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="5910.849" offset="23746748">That's the point on which they ceded to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="5913.255" offset="23756361">They put a -- they made a modification in the decree which we believed protected against any possibility that the new company would be reluctant to complete vigorously against El Paso because of the common stock ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="5930.226" offset="23824280">And finally, I would say Mr. Justice that in examining these various proposals that it made in reexamining our opposition quite frankly, we concluded that there was some more equities to El Paso's position than we had realized and perhaps some of our opposition that we had taken in the District Court upon further analysis wouldn't stand up.</text>
            <text syncTime="5952.986" offset="23915290">I mean, for example that the fact of the amount of the reserves, the very substantial $100 million in addition to the El Paso are given.</text>
            <text syncTime="5961.856" offset="23950817">And it seemed to us on balance, on balance that the Attorney General concluded that the public interest in achieving prompt divestiture would be better served in this case by accepting this compromise than by continuing to press for litigation with its uncertainties where there's a possible even greater to life.</text>
            <text syncTime="5983.384" offset="24036916">And of course, this is the kind of a decision, the Attorney General always has to make when the years considering whether to settle the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5992.143" offset="24071920">On the one hand, one of the likelihood of getting a substantially better result if he litigates; two, what is the likely hood that if you litigate you won't do as well?</text>
            <text syncTime="6003.494" offset="24117373">You have to consider particularly in this case the time situation that there will be further delays if he pressed the matter and of course there is no settlement in an antitrust case that satisfies everybody.</text>

            <text syncTime="6877.634" offset="27613915">Some very harsh things have been said about the stipulation in this decree by the three appellants the more there's denying intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="6886.569" offset="27649651">I think that in all fairness it should be noted that in the court below, there were some 20 applicants for intervention and that some 10 or 12 of them supported this decree in every respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6900.293" offset="27704508">I have the -- so I suggest that perhaps the decree is a matter of opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6908.084" offset="27735751">And because only these three appellants appear before this Court does not mean that there are others who would have been on the other side of their appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6917.484" offset="27773262">And when I say appeal, I would of course concur with the Solicitor General that the personal appeal from the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="6923.981" offset="27799280">There was no needed appeal from the order denying intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="6926.811" offset="27810565">And 20 such applications were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="6929.729" offset="27822268">Among others and the application for intervention was denied the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California of which one of the appellants is a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="6933.687" offset="27838151">The Public Utilities Commission of the State of California support this decree and I am think it's in the interest of the state of California, contrary to Mr. Woodbury's criticism and contrary to the Commissioner's criticism.</text>
            <text syncTime="6953.560" offset="27917563">We find no appeal to support from the two bars of natural gas in California and so it is possible to some of these criticisms are not entirely fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="6965.108" offset="27963852">I would like to now speak for a moment about El Paso.</text>
            <text syncTime="6968.373" offset="27976913">It would appear from all what is said before as though El Paso had a delightful time in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6974.701" offset="28002200">The fact is of course there were two parties and El Paso lost the suit and El Paso was ordered to divest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6982.052" offset="28031561">That was in April of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="6985.936" offset="28047130">They've recalled El Paso was called upon by the Attorney General to present a plan of divestiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="6993.446" offset="28077119">It was said to be the duty of El Paso to do so and it did present such a plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="7000.092" offset="28103764">It was on conversation discussion and negotiation to the Attorney General for a period of some four or five months.</text>
            <text syncTime="7006.969" offset="28131244">In the course of which, I will show you they were compelled to make concessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="7012.159" offset="28152038">They proceeded to solicit the consent of $785 million holders of debt of their company to consent to the division of the property so that the debt could be realigned.</text>

            <text syncTime="7031.811" offset="28230614">The Attorney General represented to the District Court twice in that period that El Paso was proceeding in good faith to develop a plan of complete divestiture and every time that I say divestiture, may it please this Court, I mean complete divestiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="7047.213" offset="28292263">And on both occasions, the Attorney General told the Court that El Paso was proceeding in all good faith than there was reason to believe that the parties could present a stipulated decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="7059.519" offset="28341478">Finally in October, they all had the consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="7062.162" offset="28352031">They thought they had a decree and they presented this to the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="7071.434" offset="28389125">However, may I say Your Honor, I'd like to indicate that El Paso feels that it was not likely dealt with that this was not a favorable result for El Paso that El Paso did not come off well as some of these parties would suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="7087.108" offset="28451819">And so I am suggesting that concessions were made all the way along the line in trading with the Attorney General in the hope of getting them agreed divestiture and then finally and for the first time on December the 2nd, the Attorney General announced our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="7101.097" offset="28507721">And the position we announce was the ground set forth the other day which were picked up for petitions for intervention theretofore filed and subsequently the company was compelled to yield on what it considered to be the major issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7117.022" offset="28571460">Could it sustain its position in the Court or would the Attorney General that in view of the wide distribution of its stock, it could be permitted to distributive stock in one form or another to its shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="7131.990" offset="28631333">The counsel is in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="7133.711" offset="28638229">The Solicitor General is in error in one respect only.</text>
            <text syncTime="7136.870" offset="28650872">We did not propose the Redding (ph) answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="7139.444" offset="28661112">It was forced in our throats by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="7142.895" offset="28674905">And we accepted it under protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="7145.369" offset="28684831">But we did accept it for one reason that relying upon the power of the Attorney General to bind the United States in the settlement, we could bring him in to this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7159.780" offset="28742510">And after all, it is not in the interest of El Paso to be forever in Court and I suggest to this Court the question here is not whether one intervenor shall be before you criticizing this decree, the question is whether 20 intervenors, each one of which has this great or better right than anyone who appeared here today to intervene and express his views should be heard from also.</text>
            <text syncTime="7185.348" offset="28844805">And this thing will develop into a series of disputes between various interests, various markets, various purchasers, various states and the end of the litigation will not be early or soon.</text>
            <text syncTime="7200.285" offset="28904469">And it was that which was the purpose of this settlement as far as El Paso was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="7205.783" offset="28926516">Now, when El Paso made this agreement, when it yielded its position with respect to the distribution of the stock, it received something in return it has said, it received a concession as to the four or five points which the Government had been urging and which El Paso felt were totally lacking in legal or factual basis or substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="7231.915" offset="29031006">And that therefore, they gave much and got little but let it be noted that no one of these matters which was in dispute involved a question of whether or not El Paso would diverse all of the properties which it had acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="7246.700" offset="29090147">And no claim when analyzed can reasonably be made that an attempt to withhold any so-called fruit or benefit of the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="7257.386" offset="29132884">The plan which was proposed and so far as the property is concerned accepted, involved a transfer of $265 million in net utility plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="7270.090" offset="29183770">It involved a division of debt so that the new company $180 million only $145 million in first mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="7279.622" offset="29221909">We were criticized for being able to make this deal with all of the bondholders and debenture holders what we thought was the minimum cost of one-eighth of one percent and now arrive at the present day with an interest rate of four and seven-eights percent on the average which on the hold, may it please this Court, is a pretty good.</text>
            <text syncTime="7298.639" offset="29297977">It certainly couldn't be approved upon if we had to start over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="7303.482" offset="29317308">We transferred all of the properties and assets which we had acquired by way of pipeline to the new company.</text>
            <text syncTime="7312.081" offset="29351685">We transferred to the new company all of the extensions and betterments constructed by El Paso at the cost of $50 million not one dollar of which came from Pacific Northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="7324.246" offset="29400377">We transferred a gasoline plant at the cost of $9.5 million and not one dollar of that came from Pacific Northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="7332.661" offset="29434023">We transferred $7.5 million -- trillion cubic feet of reserves which was three trillion in excess of what we acquired from Pacific Northwest and one and seven-tenths trillion more even after having served the Northwest Public during that entire period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="7352.972" offset="29515212">Now, as -- some remark was made here, surely thoughtlessly without the record before the person who made the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="7361.763" offset="29550425">They would not divest in West Coast Transmission stock, well of course we are.</text>
            <text syncTime="7366.418" offset="29569024">We have to divest it within a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="7368.608" offset="29577801">And we would have divested it before this but by this appeal and we submit you that all that we said is that we retain the proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="7376.719" offset="29610297">Well, I assume that we are going to bring -- permit obtain the proceeds of the divestiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="7381.219" offset="29628270">At least, I didn't know that divestiture here meant confiscation and so divestiture is not involved in that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="7388.268" offset="29656482">It's simply a question of whether a company adequately capitalized already should receive more capital in the form of their proceeds in the divested stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="7397.942" offset="29695143">And we submit no case was ever made.</text>
            <text syncTime="7399.845" offset="29702771">No claim ever made that the new company is not adequately financed to perform its service in the northwest that it would be certificated by the Federal Power Commission and it's ever so much more powerful and able to compete for future increments of gas in California than Pacific Northwest ever was.</text>

            <text syncTime="7450.084" offset="29903705">I am sorry I don't know of any such figure, the only place where I remember $45 million is the money that El Paso spent in developing the gas reserves of Pacific Southwest in San Juan and not one dollar of that's coming back and not one dollar of that came after Pacific Southwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="7466.501" offset="29969324">Barely the truth of the matter is, may it please the Court, that it's just as necessary for El Paso to serve the Northwest as it is for the Northwest to be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="7475.553" offset="30005582">It has a duty to serve northwest and it cannot depart from that duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="7480.597" offset="30025749">It also has the duty to serve the certificated markets of California in the Southwest and it must fulfill those duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="7487.071" offset="30051662">And it must require and retain to have the reserves on hand to perform their contracts and to have end El Paso throughout this period of merger has extensively acquired reserves and that's why it is able to give back to Pacific South and Pacific Northwest not only what it had but three trillion more cubic feet of gas being all of the sources owned by El Paso in the rocky mountain area and connected to the pipeline system, all of its access and sources and in Canada and in addition 285 billion cubic feet acquired by them to San Juan Basin which the gentleman speak in here (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="7527.930" offset="30215084">And so we stand here today with both of the companies, the new company and the old company with exactly the same deliverability of gas for its respective markets 14 years with exactly the same rate of interest for the debt of all companies which I assure it was less than the interest rates of today and with the capitalization which I has been approved of the bondholders or the debenture holders by giving their consents to this reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="7553.339" offset="30316753">And so I can link my statement for today by saying, may it please this Court, there has been complete, there has been complete diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="7561.991" offset="30351339">But beyond that, if these people with the most remote connection with the entire problem can raise this issue before this Court then I assure you that all of a 100 customers of El Paso, all of the thousands consumers of consumers in Southern California along with Mr. Woodbury's plant, the buyers in California and the people of other markets are likewise entitled to intervene to attempt to try before this case in this proceeding what shall be done with the disputes of the gas reserves between different markets, different purchasers and different interests and I submit that is unrelated to the purpose of this decree which is divestiture and not settlement of all of the reserve problems in the national gas industry of the west.</text>

            <text syncTime="7878.992" offset="31619323">For example in the several years about four years following the acquisition of the stock, El Paso brought in a whole new formation below the fields where Pacific Northwest had been exploring and developing.</text>
            <text syncTime="7896.737" offset="31690271">And the figure is the neighborhood of four trillion cubic feet and they do not propose to turn this over to the new company.</text>
            <text syncTime="7908.583" offset="31737710">Now, I would like to address myself for one moment to the Government's contention about very grave consequences if these applicants are not permitted in.</text>
            <text syncTime="7918.359" offset="31776789">I draw Your Honors' attention again to this -- to the nature of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7924.094" offset="31799777">We're dealing with a public service company that customers are public service companies completely dependent upon the outcome of this litigation as to their future.</text>
            <text syncTime="7934.505" offset="31841364">They built their organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="7936.439" offset="31849096">They've incurred their debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="7937.668" offset="31854007">They've marketed securities and they have acquired customers in the expectation that their supplier will be a company that has vast surplus gas reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="7950.867" offset="31906879">This Court found that Pacific Northwest Pipeline was such a company and we know that El Paso is such a company.</text>
            <text syncTime="7957.295" offset="31932583">Now, in order to restore that competitive position, the reserve situation alone must be modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="7966.333" offset="31968737">In addition, El Paso seeks to retain certain other benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="7971.447" offset="31989112">Thank you.</text>
