            <text syncTime="23.121" offset="197945">Mr. Ennis.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward J. Ennis</label>
            <text syncTime="25.608" offset="207872">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.144" offset="218008">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit, which unanimously affirmed a summary judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, holding that the petitioner had expatriated himself pursuant to the authority of 401 (e) of the Nationality Act of 1940 by the act of voting in an election in the State of Israel in 1951 for the legislature of the State of Israel.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.039" offset="373593">This case was to be argued by the general counsel for the New York Civil Liberties Union Nanette Dembitz-Berman, who wrote the briefs in the case and it is Mrs. Berman's appointment as a judge of the family court of the City of New York that brings me here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.082" offset="457707">She is very disappointed that she missed this opportunity to address the Court on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.062" offset="485710">The facts are very simple and are stated in a stipulation of facts which appears in the record and -- at page 11 and are simply that the petitioner who was born in Poland in 1893, immigrated to the United States in 1912, was naturalized in 1926 and went to Israel in 1949, a year after that state was established in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.993" offset="621443">And in 1951, he voted for the second Knesset, which was the second election of the legislature of Israel.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.982" offset="657387">At that time indeed, when there was no Israeli citizenship at all and that everyone who voted in that election, voted on the basis of their residence in Israel.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.962" offset="693227">Indeed, it was that legislature which a year later adopted the first Israeli law of nationality and established Israeli nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.405" offset="743069">The District Court, in the basis of the stipulation of facts in which it appeared that the petitioner voluntarily voted in that political election, stated that it was bound by the decision of this court in the Perez case in 1958 and held that he had lost his citizenship as indeed when he applied for a United States passport in 1960 to return to the United States, the consul in Israel so determined and the State Department approved that loss of citizenship and when he did return, he obtained a full hearing, which is part of the record, before the Passport Review Board which affirmed this loss of nationality and then he brought this -- this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.630" offset="931986">The record does indicate that the man's profession, he was an artist by profession, a painter and sculptor, and indeed in this country, he has some of his paintings which are products of the WPA Art Program in some of our high schools and hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.398" offset="991023">The case presents squarely the constitutionality of this Section 401 (e) of the Nationality Act of 1940, which is repeated in haec verba in Sections 349 of the present Immigration and Nationality Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.073" offset="1093736">Mr. Justice Harlan, when I -- I recognize the -- from the facts of the reargument that was ordered in Perez, the 100 pages of opinions on that -- in that case and the Trop case, the 75 of pages of opinion in the Mendoza case which followed a year -- few years later, in which again the court ordered rearguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.171" offset="1166148">When I read the opinions of the Court in those cases and read the records in the briefs, I must say I was nonplussed as to what I've read to the consideration of the Court of this -- again of this issue, which has been obviously so painstakingly considered by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.655" offset="1240022">In the short time that is available to me, I felt it would be bootless and of no assistance to the Court to try to review here the formulations of the applicable constitutional doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.584" offset="1295715">Most of the justices are sitting here have expressed themselves on the constitutional doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.325" offset="1322674">It occurred to me that in my short time, I might assist the Court by examining very briefly the two factual propositions which are, I submit, accepted by the majority of the Court in the present case and which I believe are factually false.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.680" offset="1400101">One of those propositions in which the Solicitor General bases his argument, one of those propositions is that for an American citizen to vote in a foreign election is an indication of some diminution of his allegiance to the United States and some adherence to a foreign allegiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.670" offset="1484110">The other proposition is that for an American citizen to so vote in a foreign election, in some way embroils the United States in foreign affairs or in some way exacerbates or makes more difficult the handling of foreign affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.325" offset="1550670">I would submit to Your Honors very briefly that both of those propositions are factually inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.639" offset="1579928">Now, as to the first proposition, that voting in the --</text>

            <text syncTime="391.600" offset="1671774">I agree -- subject to my basic constitutional position that where we're dealing with citizenship granted by the Fourteenth Amendment, a Congress has much less authority and indeed, my final proposition is that Congress has no authority, under the Constitution to remove United States citizenship that this can only be done by the voluntary act of the United States citizen and all that the power of Congress is, is to regulate the manner in which this voluntary expatriation shall be expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.419" offset="1815134">Obviously, a man cannot put a note of expatriation on his desk floor and take it out when he wants to.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.924" offset="1837077">Congress can say that if you wish to adjure allegiance to the United States, if you're abroad, you must do it before a consul.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.523" offset="1867483">If you are in the United States, you must do it on the forms supplied by the Attorney General of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.505" offset="1887441">The limit of Congress' power is to regulate voluntary conduct or conduct which in most instances or in common experience is voluntary.</text>

            <text syncTime="460.645" offset="1948045">From the Fourteenth Amendment which provides that every person born in the United States or naturalized alien is a citizen of the United States and the state in which he resides.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.750" offset="2000394">And from the opinions expressed by some of the justices that this sets up a relationship between the United States and its citizens, which the Congress does not have the power to terminate, that the relationship of citizenship can only be terminated by the act of the individual and that Congress is therefore limited to regulating those voluntary acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="529.115" offset="2221913">I'm becoming a citizen of another country but there are a lot of dual citizenships in the world.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.264" offset="2254514">I say I'm still a citizen.”</text>

            <text syncTime="632.572" offset="2635692">This came into the law in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.877" offset="2648963">Our courts, from the founding of the Republic until 1868, in many opinions of this Court and other courts, had considered the whole problem of expatriation and indeed a very strong opinion was held that the common law applied and that allegiance was permanent and there could be no expatriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.641" offset="2723986">This was debated in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.734" offset="2732345">There were cases on voting for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.210" offset="2742272">There were three cases, a federal case, a main case, and Iowa case in which the individuals had voted in Canadian elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.113" offset="2769857">The courts unanimously held that voting was not an indication of loss of United States allegiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.215" offset="2798279">These cases are quoted in Borchard's Diplomatic Protection Abroad and cited in our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="858.884" offset="3540992">This 1940 law is on the books for only one reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.295" offset="3562621">The Chairman of the Immigration of the Judiciary Committee, Immigration Subcommittee, Mr. Dickstein of New York, was exercised by the fact that German aliens, resident aliens and naturalized Germans went back to the czar in 1935 and voted that the czar should be German rather than French.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.123" offset="3645900">This didn't bother the French government.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.084" offset="3653736">It didn't bother the German government, it didn't bother the State Department but it certainly bothered Mr. Dickstein and he proposed to the President of the United States that he set up a commission to examine the nationality laws and to codify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.184" offset="3734194">In the course of that codification, a new section which we're dealing with crept into the codification which the -- which was transmitted to the president for the very modest letter by the Secretary of State and the Attorney General to the effect that these are only suggestions for the consideration of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.224" offset="3826354">One of these suggestions was voting in a political election in a foreign state or participating in an election of plebiscite to determine the sovereignty of a foreign territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.325" offset="3870762">The entire support for that proposal is in two short paragraphs.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.488" offset="3895421">In the rest of this report, the other proposals are supported by judicial decisions, by diplomatic decisions, the correspondence between the Secretary of State and foreign governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.613" offset="3939830">This course which we're dealing with has two sentences in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.212" offset="3958220">Along the line, Your Honor, suggested without any factual support whatever and here's what they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.394" offset="3986954">This section is clear, applicable on any case on American votes in a political election in a foreign state whether or not he's a national thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.608" offset="4015898">Taking an active part in the political affairs of a foreign state by voting in a political election therein is believed to involve a political attachment and practical allegiance thereto, which is in consistent with continued allegiance to the United States whether or not the person in question has acquired the nationality of the foreign state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.283" offset="4106595">There was not one iota of factual support for the statement prepared by the State Department, I think by the Assistant Solicitor, Mr. Flournoy, who was the State Department expert for many years on nationality questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.233" offset="4170334">At the suggestion of the -- Mr. Dickstein, the Chairman of the House Immigration Committee, there is -- not only no support for that statement but the factual evidence in the diplomatic history of the United States was at that time that voting in a foreign election was not an indication of throwing offered or any diminution of allegiance to the United States for taking on allegiance to a foreign state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.551" offset="4283601">As I've indicated to the Court, the judicial decisions which are the contrary, the diplomatic correspondence which discussed that great length how you could lose United States nationality was limited entirely to naturalization abroad, and residing abroad as part of that naturalization, or adjuring allegiance to the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1120.094" offset="4585785">The first page of the record contains Mr. Afroyim's identification booklet which he had a hand in when he voted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1230.673" offset="5028091">This law has been held to take away the United States citizenship even if you vote in a municipal election as to whether it should be local option that forbear control or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.395" offset="5066961">This law has been -- by the people administering it by the lower trib -- administrative tribunals, they say any voting in a foreign political election or in a plebiscite takes away your United States citizenship and I do not think that Your Honor's distinction will support the constitutionality of this statute because I do not believe that a dual citizen, the voting in a foreign election and exercising his rights under his second citizenship indicates any desire to terminate his United States citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.073" offset="5201753">I do not think that factual supports there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.724" offset="5212306">At any rate, it is curious that the instance which brought this law into being in this all instance, as I say without any diplomatic or factual or judicial support was this voting in the czar which disturbed me that our Government nor the other two governments involved, the German or the French government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.985" offset="5305407">But it's suggested in this one paragraph, which is all that this Court relied on in Perez.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.434" offset="5331111">In any event, it is not believed that an American national should be permitted to participate in the politics, in the political affairs of a foreign state and at the same time retain his American nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.135" offset="5389939">The two facts would seem to be inconsistent with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.462" offset="5403314">I suggest to Your Honors that in view of the complete lack of any authority for that statement, it is purposely extremely tentative in its own terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.608" offset="5447826">It's a suggestion and curiously enough, Congress took this tentative suggestion and passed it without any debate at all and put this into the Nationality Act, which was generally a codification of the former laws and edit this provision without any debate on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3898.878" offset="15700888">Your Honor, under the Nationality Act and the laws of nationality, there are some 15 grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.173" offset="15726070">Now the way it's determined whether a person has lost it's nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.562" offset="15739653">He goes through a passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.883" offset="15744982">He goes to the consul.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.459" offset="15751252">This printed form, Your Honor, Certificate of Laws and Nationality, he gives an affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.503" offset="15775389">It's made out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.715" offset="15780300">Here's the certificate that he lost his nationality by voting in an election on July 30 of 1951 not that he used the passport there who was naturalized in some other country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.680" offset="15820110">That's a precise issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.280" offset="15830559">And the Certificate of Nationality was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.700" offset="15844248">Now, what is this business on the record?</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.380" offset="15854905">When he got to the United States, now I learned from my friend here that he got here on Israeli passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.989" offset="15873400">Well, may be that's the only he could get here when in 1960, the United States consul said he'd lost his citizenship and that he -- and he came here to bring the suit to get it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.141" offset="15909972">Now, what happens?</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.210" offset="15918226">When the consul issues this Certificate of Nationality, you have under the State Department regulations an appeal to the Passport Review Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.302" offset="15954589">This is a transcript of the record, 100 pages in which to Mr. Afroyim himself without counsel went before these three members of the board and there were president in addition to the three members: the chief of the foreign operations division and specialist on Israeli affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3977.227" offset="16014357">Now, they talked to Mr. Afroyim for a 100 pages and they talked on one issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.209" offset="16034210">Did you lose your nationality when you voted in the one election in 1951?</text>
            <text syncTime="3988.788" offset="16060541">Now, in the basis of the record and their affirmance of the consul's action, he brought an action in the District Court and his attorney, and he insist the United States attorney assisted by the attorney for the District Court as well the Immigration Service, do stipulation of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.240" offset="16122399">Now on page 11 it says that, “On November 14, 1960, the American consul in Haiti ruled he had lost his -- that he had expatriated himself on July 30 of 1951 by voting in a political election in a foreign state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4020.834" offset="16188750">That's all that was in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.081" offset="16197736">It was whether that vote lost his nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4025.643" offset="16207976">Now, in addition to the stipulation, the Government brought in at the hearing before the district judge the administrative file offered in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.256" offset="16250399">It's limited to the 1950 -- to the -- 1951 issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.542" offset="16259594">We made no objection, his attorney at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.063" offset="16269625">And this is part of the record and it's in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.879" offset="16288956">But still, the issue is only one simple thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.805" offset="16300659">Did you lose your citizenship by voting in 1951?</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.231" offset="16314347">Now, my friend, Mr. Gordon called me and he said, “I found out that your client had a passport, an Israeli passport.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4058.603" offset="16339843">I said, “Charles”, I said this, “I don't -- I didn't know that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4062.309" offset="16354680">I said, “This has got nothing to do with the case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.398" offset="16363039">The Nationality Act does not make having a foreign passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="4068.720" offset="16380280">It was in -- by the way, it was in described to the '40 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4070.981" offset="16389371">It was stricken out by Congress using a foreign passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="4074.378" offset="16402954">I said, “Charles, it's not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4076.566" offset="16411732">The record is limited -- I'm perfectly happy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4079.265" offset="16422494">I have the record included this 100 pages discussion about this 1951 loss of nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.329" offset="16442765">I said, “These passports which you discovered from the Immigration file”, which the Solicitor General of the United States has not relied on in his brief and you want to bring this in, it can only have one purpose to prejudice this Court against this individual and I object.</text>
            <text syncTime="4098.317" offset="16498667">And if you do it, I will tell the Court it's improper and I object”, which I'm telling the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4103.823" offset="16520714">Now, I submit to Your Honor, that if this -- that this Court has a complete record here on which to rule whether Mr. Afroyim lost his nationality by his vote 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.758" offset="16564496">If he did not lose it by his vote in 1951, the Department State of the United States is perfectly free to tell him that he lost it by having a passport, by voting in a 1952 election, by voting in a 1953 election or any other ground which they want to imply although its not expressed in the loss of nationality provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.328" offset="16654775">This is a separate proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4138.885" offset="16660940">This isn't a matter at large to decide whether Mr. Afroyim lost his nationality by four or five of the 20 Acts set there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.321" offset="16686749">It's to decide whether he lost it by voting in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="4149.437" offset="16703154">And this record is 100 percent complete on that issue because it's a 100 pages of passport review testimony limited to that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4158.841" offset="16740770">These passports are not in this case; they have no business in the case and they're -- here they merely confused issue and why.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.618" offset="16771908">Because the Government perhaps now feels that since as part of the passport record, as part of this appeal record, there was this identification document which everybody who resides in Israel gets and that has in it an indication that he voted in a municipal election and in other elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.367" offset="16850902">But the Department of State, knowing this, did not decide to wholly was expatriated for those elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="4195.287" offset="16886533">This -- the Department of State decided and all we have here is the decision whether he lost his nationality by voting in the 1951 election, there's nothing else in the case and this record is entirely complete for this Court to decide whether Perez is a law of the United States.</text>
