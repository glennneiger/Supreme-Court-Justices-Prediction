            <text syncTime="174.242" offset="696947">And we have in the decision of this Court in St. Clair County versus Interstate Transport Company, 192 U.S. 454 language quoted approvingly by the Court at page 466 that a ferry is a continuation of the highway from one side of the water over which it passes to the other and that consequently an ordinary ferry and I'm distinguishing that from a railroad car ferry or something of this nature is considered a part of the public highway system unless the Commission for some reason concludes that it constitutes a line hole water movement subject to Part III.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.152" offset="1472575">The issue here is similar that is whether or not the purchased transportation from a railroad in TOFC operations constitutes the operations of a motor vehicle over the public highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.907" offset="1539553">This line of cases begins with the Acme Fast Freight litigation which we have reviewed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.595" offset="1566302">There, a forwarder operation was conducted in part by operating motor vehicles directly by the forwarder and in part by the purchase of transportation from rails, water and motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.693" offset="1642684">It was held by Division 5 of the Commission and later by a full Commission decision by Commissioner Eastman that the authority of the motor carrier was limited to operations by motor vehicle upon the public highway and they granted the grandfather right certificate only as to those portions of the operation which they prove they were actually conducting themselves on the public highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.178" offset="1756682">The reviewing court said flatly that a forwarding company could hardly be in operations on a public highway when it contracts for transportation there by independent connecting carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.131" offset="1816451">This Court affirmed the Acme decision in 309 U.S. and it has been followed in four other court cases involving grandfather rights, three of which have been affirmed by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.478" offset="1917910">One is that these rules have an anticompetitive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.147" offset="1940584">That is if we published a reduced TOFC rate for the specific purpose of bringing business to the railroads in TOFC service and under Rules 2 and 3, that rate becomes automatically available to our competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.651" offset="2014563">The goal of competition is certainly blunted.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.705" offset="2030759">The -- a second reason is that under the rules, under certain of the plans where we publish our rates for the provision of equipment, our equipment would become available to our competitors.A substantial amount of business is rooted by shippers, by those carriers which protect them in the provision of equipment.Here, we would be sharing our equipment under our obligation to provide nondiscriminatory service not only to our ordinary shippers but to our competitors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1234.381" offset="4937456">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.829" offset="4951249">I should like to deal briefly with one of the issues in this case that seems to me dispositive of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.505" offset="5001927">As I understand Mr. Ginnane, he seeks to derive from the provisions of Section 2 and 3 (1) of the Act, a principle of equality as he puts it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.160" offset="5068591">I should note and I'll have more to say this later that the Commission did not rely on 3 (1), a good reason I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.153" offset="5116552">But in any event, what is sought to be derived from these provisions is a principle of equality and I think Mr. Ginnane states it in these terms that one man have looked to the ownership of the goods, one man have looked to the competitive situation, if traffic is tendered by a shipper or a freight forwarder or a motor carrier to a railroad, the same service must be afforded at the same rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.098" offset="5300349">Now, if any such principle is to be derived from the provisions of Section 2 and 3 of the Act, I suggest that that principle condemns rather than supports the rules which had been promulgated by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.198" offset="5408705">Be sure, under these rules, the motor carrier is entitled under the open tariff to move its traffic -- to move the traffic that it's moving for a customer, at the same rate as the shipper or the forwarder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.821" offset="5535242">But it's entitled to move it under these rules at a preferred rate, at a better rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.751" offset="5562932">It's entitled to enter into through routes and joint rates and to work out divisions pursuant to which the motor carrier will move the traffic of its customer over the railroad at a lesser rate than the rate at which the shipper may or its competitor, the freight forwarder man, so that in the matter of -- under this principle of equality, on the matter of rates, it is clear under these rules that the motor carrier may move its traffic at something that isn't governed by a principle of equality under divisions and through routes and joint rates at a lesser rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1582.540" offset="6330096">So far as service is concerned, the shipper can operate at any service point but not the motor carrier, under these rules, he must offer at a joint service point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.203" offset="6384744">The shipper or the freight forwarder may say, “You must take it by the most direct route”, but not the motor carrier, he can't use it unless it's at least 85% as roundabout as his highway route.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.052" offset="6444199">The shipper or the motor -- or the freight forwarder can say, “Take it to the service point nearest destination”, but not the motor carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="1627.187" offset="6508669">All I'm saying is that if there is any principle of equality could be derived from 2 and 3, these rules do not carry out any such principle either as to rates or as to service as between the motor carrier and the shipper or the freight forwarder and I suggest that that kind of a principle of -- either of the principle must be wrong or the results are wrong and I think both now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.799" offset="6623190">I take it that that he know this agreement, I should hope between Mr. Ginnane and myself that the Commission must find some substantive authority in this Act to justify these rules and if it justifies these rules on any grounds, it's under Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.798" offset="6739174">That is the only Section to which reference is made.</text>

            <text syncTime="1882.299" offset="7529117">But Section 3 provides expressly and there's no disagreement that I take it between us that you can't let a preference in service but there's a difficulty with Section 3 which the Chief Justice noted and that is that it has a proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.366" offset="7605394">And that proviso says that this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to discrimination, prejudice or disadvantage to the traffic of any other carrier of whatever description.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.898" offset="7687523">Now, I suggest to the Court that that language is clear and it is general.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.849" offset="7723363">Section 3 doesn't -- can't be construed to apply to any discrimination or disadvantage to the traffic of any other carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.210" offset="7764741">Mr. Ginnane would have you read it as saying that it may not be construed as applying to discrimination or disadvantage to the traffic of any other carrier if that discrimination or disadvantage is accomplished by undercutting the rates of the other carrier -- the other carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.295" offset="7877172">Well, I think that no amount of legislative history would permit a rewriting of that proviso to that extent but in any event, there is no legislative history to support any such contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.652" offset="7958570">The one piece of legislative history which is referred to as the statement of Senator Wheeler in introducing this proviso into 216 (d) in Part II but it was taken over from there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.159" offset="8032549">And to be sure, Senator Wheeler said, the occasion for putting this proviso in is that some of the motor carriers fear that Section 3 would be construed to extend to discrimination or disadvantage resulting from undercutting the railroads rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.968" offset="8111856">But he goes on to say, this proviso was unnecessary, Section 3 (1) from which 216 is derived, has always been construed as applying only to preferences or discrimination preference or prejudice, the language of 3 (1) between patrons or to the traffic of patrons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.181" offset="8236722">And he says this, reading it quite clearly, in contrast of the proviso relating to discrimination or preferences to the traffic of any other carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.710" offset="8294818">And indeed, the cases construing 3 (1) before the proviso had held that it was not applicable to discrimination against another carrier or the traffic of another carrier but only discrimination relating to shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.737" offset="8382903">And so I suggest to the Court that the language of this proviso clearly indicates that 3 (1) is not applicable as a basis for requiring that the traffic of competitors be treated the same as the traffic of shippers or --</text>

            <text syncTime="2412.619" offset="9650469">There, the Commission has the authority to force through routes and joint rates and it has the authority to see that the railroad provides adequate facility to carry it on and it has the authority under 3 (4) to see that it doesn't discriminate between others and Eastman wanted this in Part II and couldn't get any support for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.029" offset="9748062">And subsequently on several occasions, the Commission is trying to get this authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="2448.047" offset="9792157">I'm not saying that it's wise that there shouldn't be provisions that permits the Commission to require proper coordination of service between the motor carriers and the rails, I'm saying that it is clear that they haven't got it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2491.930" offset="9967700">Can they use their open tariffs?</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.540" offset="9974073">Mr. Ginnane said, “Yes,” and I suppose there's any principle of equality a railroad can also hand over the traffic it doesn't want to another railroad or to another carrier -- motor carrier when it gets it from a motor carrier, hand it on to another railroad or another motor carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.022" offset="10048052">The dissenting Commissioner must have a way of thought this introduced an incredible confusion and we didn't know where we're getting.</text>

            <text syncTime="2524.061" offset="10096222">But certainly, the Commission doesn't know where it leads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.771" offset="10111060">It's made no record on this and it hasn't addressed itself to it and it certainly hasn't shown the discriminating awareness or the consequences of its acts which appears to be the standard of Burlington and this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.290" offset="10197159">I think that there is enormous confusion and some of the questions indicate the problems of confusion, in this situation and the reason there is, is that the Commission has not stated clearly what its position is, what support there is for that position and where it leads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.911" offset="10303634">And a minimum seems to me that should be returned to tell us that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2590.767" offset="10362984">Just let me make this final point, Mr. Ginnane, I gather, says that this is an interpretive rule and I take it what it means by that is that the Commission's opinion is nothing but stating what it understands, Section 2 could mean in this context and if it's wrong, I suppose, the answer of this Court would be that you're wrong and then it's up to them to proceed under some other section if they choose to do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2927.024" offset="11708082">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.021" offset="11732010">There is no question that the Commission has no power to compel through routes and joint rates between railroads and motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.796" offset="11771089">Now, that's something that I think some find shocking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.622" offset="11782478">I know I did when I first discovered it because I thought the Commission could compel a railroad to do just about anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.790" offset="11807138">But I think that lies at the root of this case because I think what the Commission has done by Rules 2 and 3 is try to overcome this lack of power it had to compel through routes and joint rates and supply it through the device of these rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.945" offset="11875683">We submit that Rules 2 and 3 do result in through motor-rail routes and therefore in -- are invalid as beyond the authority of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.188" offset="11924689">Now what is a through route?</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.402" offset="11933571">I think very basically and simply, a through route is an arrangement either expressed or implied between connecting carriers for the carriage, for the continuous carriage of goods over the lines of such carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.558" offset="11998145">In other words, there's no need for the shipper once he's tendered it to the originating carrier to intervene again, he gets a through movement almost by the name, a continuous movement over the lines of two or more carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.417" offset="12053629">Now, I would suggest that physically the transportation which Rules 2 and 3 would produce, meets every test of through motor-rail transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.475" offset="12097829">The motor carrier would pick it up from the shipper under his tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.051" offset="12112144">He would bring it to the railroad terminal, turn it over to the railroad, ask them to move it to their ramp, take it back and deliver it to the shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.007" offset="12147984">Now, that is the traditional example of a through motor-rail-motor movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.334" offset="12173270">Now, when we raised this contention before the Commission, they had one answer to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.317" offset="12197198">They said even conceding these were through routes, they weren't compulsory and they said that because the motor carrier didn't have to use the service, well, that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.568" offset="12246204">But then they also said there was no duty on the railroads to publish any trailer-on-flatcar tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.825" offset="12275252">In other words, they were suggesting that we could completely abandon our trailer-on-flatcar business, our tremendous investment in it, if we didn't want the motor carriers to use our tariffs and therefore, the continued maintenance of our tariffs and what I suggest are these through motor-rail routes was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.120" offset="12348395">I suggest that's wrong as a matter of law and ridiculous as a matter of common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.033" offset="12372114">I suggest that it's wrong as a matter of law because once we have all this equipment and facilities, under Section 1 (4) of the Act, a shipper upon a reasonable request can require us to produce the transportation and publish charges for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.255" offset="12432927">I would suggest that as a matter of common sense, it's like saying that the man who gave up his wallet to the robber on the threat -- your money or your life did so voluntarily because he had a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.061" offset="12488202">Now on brief, the Government and the Commission and the motor carriers try a new attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.904" offset="12515579">They say, these aren't through routes because there's no holding out so even if compulsory, Rules 2 and 3 don't violate the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.763" offset="12559047">And for this effort, they cite one sentence from the opinion of this Court in Thompson versus United States which did say that the test of a through route is a holding out by the carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.711" offset="12610769">But of course, what the Court was examining in Thompson was a voluntary through route.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.241" offset="12632921">The Commission had decided not to use its compulsory powers in Thompson but had found the existence of a voluntary through route.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.148" offset="12664581">Well, of course, if you're looking to see whether a voluntary through route has been established, it's quite appropriate to see if there's been a holding out by the carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.203" offset="12700735">I would also suggest to Your Honors that in this case, there is no holding out by the railroads and that's our real objection, our real complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.113" offset="12736366">The motor carriers hold it out for us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.564" offset="12746188">They're going to hold out without our consent, without our prior agreement, a motor-rail motor service.</text>

            <text syncTime="3642.297" offset="14569117">That's correct because the trucker has no right to ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.302" offset="14585208">I would suspect that the real -- we think we have the best of the statutory and the technical legal arguments but I would suggest that at least what is most troublesome to most people who hear about this is “What's the matter with you railroads, why don't you want this business?</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.059" offset="14652186">Why don't you want motor carriers to come to you and turn trailers over to you under your tariff?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.542" offset="14678100">Well, I would suggest that there are many, many practical reasons why railroads want to have the right to agree in advance to enter in the through route arrangements where they can negotiate all of the various provisions that are entailed in a through route service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.748" offset="14746958">First of all, now the quite simple answer and that is the railroads are quite naturally weary of their motor carrier competitors bearing gifts but that's no real practical answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.825" offset="14795233">The answer it seems to me is that motor carrier has no obligation to turn all of his business over to us or any specific portion of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.522" offset="14830028">Therefore, the business that he is liable to turn over to us is the business that there is the most difficulty in handling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.667" offset="14858658">Now, Mr. Ginnane suggested that the motor carriers are reasonable men and they would make arrangements in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.644" offset="14886557">Well, I would suggest that the advancement of the railroads piggyback service is not necessarily the principle or a prime aim of the highway carriers in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.002" offset="14927935">But secondly, there is the practical problem that much freight in this country is one-directional, and one of the principle cost items which raises transportation prices is the problem of empty return that you have to move back to the origin locations where much of the traffic originates empty equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.282" offset="15025110">Well, the fact is, if a motor carrier can ship via us, he can turn over to us this surplus or one-way business that he has for which he can't set up a balance movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.084" offset="15072235">And therefore, we'll have to confront ourselves not only with our own empty return but with his also.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.564" offset="15098253">This would tend to raise railroad costs and also consequently raise railroad prices, all to the benefit of our competitor who would be continuing to publish rates for an all-highway service.</text>

            <text syncTime="3798.473" offset="15193861">The first evidence of it was actually boat-on-flatcar service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.328" offset="15209221">It began back in 1843 where a railroad was moving canal boats on flatcars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.803" offset="15235135">It kind of died out in the late 50s and then in the 1880s, the Long Island Railroad started hauling so-called farmer wagons on flatcars with the team right on the same train in a specially built boxcar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.322" offset="15289260">So, I would say the modern resur -- or the modern development of it began in 1926 but the real resurgence came in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="3831.345" offset="15325309">After the Commission had laid down all these principles and movement of highway trailers by rail, and the railroads thought, “Okay, now, we have the ground rules, let's go out and start with this thing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.656" offset="15370553">And among those ground rules were that motor carrier or that railroads handled trailers for shippers under tariffs and they handled trailers for motor carriers under through route arrangements voluntarily entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.185" offset="15424679">I would suggest another principal reason why the motor carriers want to have -- I mean, the railroads want to have a motor carrier as their partners and not as their shippers, is that we get the right to agree in advance how we are going to provide the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.050" offset="15480163">The motor carrier can't just suddenly show up at one of our terminals on a snowy Friday afternoon and say, “Here are our hundred trailers, move them.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4055.948" offset="16223713">I do represent these freight forwarder appellees in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4060.856" offset="16243357">My clients are the ones who are entirely recognized as having a right to ship and so recognized in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.161" offset="16276584">These new rules provide for an invasion of that mode of operation and that's the primary basis of the concern of my clients here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.557" offset="16314201">One of the grounds of the decision below was that the rules do violate one of its parts and sections of Part IV of the Act which regulates freight forwarding and moreover, they violate the direct intentions of Congress to keep motor carriers and railroads too, and water carriers out of the freight forwarding business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.756" offset="16403017">Now, I do want to explain furthermore to what the forwarder does.</text>
            <text syncTime="4103.635" offset="16414511">A question came up just a moment ago about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.889" offset="16431543">The forwarder company operates by making shipments over these regulated common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4116.029" offset="16464039">This operation of making shipments is the distinctive characteristic of freight forwarder operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4123.550" offset="16494132">The statute permits the freight forwarder to have his own motor vehicles inside and operate them inside a terminal area such as New York City or Washington but not to operate any of the line or haul transportation in between the terminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4144.800" offset="16579187">What the forwarder does is to assemble the shipments inside one of the terminal areas and he can do that with his trucks under the provision of the statute and then he takes them and forms a carload shipment out of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="4163.381" offset="16653479">He puts these small shipments together and he consolidates them as the general word, and he makes a carload shipment and then he tenders that shipment to a common carrier and it's almost always a railroad for the distances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.687" offset="16714710">He tenders that to a common carrier under the common carrier's tariff rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="4188.207" offset="16752744">Now the carload rates of course -- the carload rate for a single carload is less than the total amount of the rates for each of these individual shipments and the forwarder pays his own expenses and he makes his profit by that spread between the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4202.052" offset="16808124">His own rates, the forwarders' own rates must be just and reasonable to the shipper of the small goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="4208.394" offset="16833515">They are regulated by the Interstate Commerce Commission and they must be just and reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="4228.488" offset="16913868">Each of them can operate with the pick up and delivery service in the terminal area and they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4235.806" offset="16943125">There are certain limitations in different places but that's typical.</text>
            <text syncTime="4239.153" offset="16956604">Each one of them does it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4240.700" offset="16962769">But when the railroad collects those small shipments that it has, it takes them and handles them in its own rail service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4248.863" offset="16995370">When the motor carrier collects them, it's authorized to handle them in the Part II type of service and when the water carrier collects them, it takes them by water and down to the destination, and then it comes to delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="4261.210" offset="17044793">The distinction and the difference between the freight forwarder mode and the thing that Congress has called and recognized in Part IV, has stated in Part IV, to be what it calls the inherent nature of freight forwarding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4274.142" offset="17096516">The inherent nature of freight forwarding is not this matter of the collection of the shipments at each hand because all carriers do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4281.490" offset="17125878">The distinctive nature of freight forwarding and within the essence of the trouble that these rules get into is that the nature of freight forwarding is to take those shipments that it collects, combine them and then ship them on an operating carrier, but we are not an operating carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.890" offset="17199543">We ship over an operating carrier and freight forwarders are the only mode of operation of a transportation agency of which there is a statutory provision for that method of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4313.363" offset="17253355">That statute is in Part IV, provides that freight forwarders may utilize the services of a railroad or of a motor carrier or a water carrier “for the whole or any part of the transportation of such shipments”, and that is not in anyone of the rest of the sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="4334.682" offset="17338723">And moreover, it's entirely clear if we looked to the congressional history of what Congress intended that Congress expressly when it enacted Part IV, expressly decided and deliberately stated that it did not want these carriers by railroad or carriers by motor carrier or carriers by water carrier to be engaging in freight forwarding which is the matter of the shipping between the terminals.</text>

            <text syncTime="4378.325" offset="17513221">I was mentioning before the recess that Congress had deliberately examined and made its own conclusion as to whether these other carriers should be permitted to engage in the freight forwarding mode.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.043" offset="17564108">The Freight Forwarder Act was adopted in 1942 and in the legislative history preceding that, the principal report which was reflected in the final form of the Bill was a report made by the House of Representatives Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4406.029" offset="17624085">That deliberate -- that Committee deliberately took up this question about the relationship of the freight forwarder mode with the other carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4414.834" offset="17659298">And the Committee started off its report by calling attention to the fact or saying that forwarders perform a unique type of transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4424.823" offset="17699213">And then on the first page also, it mentioned that forwarders, they utilize the services of rail, motor and water carriers and ship by whatever means is the best way to do the shipping and that's what makes their form of operation unique.</text>

            <text syncTime="5447.214" offset="21788839">The same rates which they offer TOFC service to the shipping company.</text>
            <text syncTime="5452.597" offset="21810364">You got only one answer and there's only one answer really in the railroads briefs and that is that it would create shipping problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="5462.464" offset="21849757">It's a myth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5464.593" offset="21858325">They conjure up the prospect of the railroad having dump on it at 4 o'clock in a Friday afternoon, a 100 load of trailers by a motor carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="5479.597" offset="21918302">In today's transportation operations that sort of thing doesn't happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5484.873" offset="21939409">If a big shipper wants motor carriers -- wants piggyback service on any sort of a scale which is 100 trailers a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="5493.988" offset="21975876">He must sit down with the railroad weeks in advance and they schedule this traffic so that the railroad will have that equipment in position regularly at a certain time everyday.</text>
            <text syncTime="5507.481" offset="22029897">And similarly, any motor carrier that wants to utilize at any significant scale the piggyback service of a railroad, has got to sit down and participate in the same process of planning and coordination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5522.786" offset="22091128">To give you a simpler example, if at 3 o'clock this afternoon I called up Mayflower Van Lines and said, “Now I want to move tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5536.850" offset="22147344">Frankly, I'd be lucky if I've got service within three or four days.</text>
            <text syncTime="5540.929" offset="22163644">These people have to schedule their operations otherwise they're wasting equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5545.332" offset="22181303">They don't have it in position.</text>
            <text syncTime="5547.365" offset="22189453">And the railroads operating problems would be just the same in dealing with a motor carrier as it would be in dealing with a big shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.973" offset="22235847">There is a significant difference between the position of the railroad appellants in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5566.986" offset="22267925">The Western and Southeastern except Southern, the Western, Southeastern and Eastern railroads, while they contend that under the Act, a railroad -- a motor carrier can perform only motor carrier operations in a motor vehicle over the highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="5586.985" offset="22347860">There -- they concede a big qualification of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5590.753" offset="22363011">They say, except if we concur than they -- than they can operate -- operate, they can utilize piggyback service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5599.986" offset="22399896">And they say, all except southern and the freight forwarders that the motor carrier can participate in piggybacking in two ways, one under Plan V and one under Plan I.</text>
            <text syncTime="5614.264" offset="22457051">Now, Southern and the freight forwarders in taking the same position carry to the -- carry it further, they would knockout motor carrier participation in Plan I and indeed, southern and the freight forwarders have a separate lawsuit to accomplish that pending down on the three-judge court in Dallas, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5636.429" offset="22545659">Now you're told, Congress has provided for joint service between the rail and motor carriers in classical through route and joint rate arrangements and that this will take care of all -- of -- of all in need in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5653.206" offset="22612741">I would like to call the Court's attention that in 1965, out of piggyback movement of trailers of one -- over 1,400,000, only 4% took place under Plan V in classical through route joint rate arrangements where the business has done primarily under the All-Rail Plan, Plan II which was related Plan II and a half, 42% of the trailers moved under Plans II and II and a half; Next, under Plan III, the open tariff not available to motor carriers, 26%.</text>
            <text syncTime="5692.822" offset="22771252">The only significant motor carrier participation and utilization of piggyback services was under Plan I which accounted for 23% and as I say Southern and the freight forwarders are trying to knockout Plan I which would mean that the motor carriers in terms of the history to date would participate in about 4% of trailer on flatcar service.</text>

            <text syncTime="5769.210" offset="23076780">As a matter of fact, it didn't even explain why in 1936 it had held the contrary and that is what it is now holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5780.093" offset="23120353">Back in 1936, the Commission said, we have here a published rail tariff and a motor carrier would have the same right to make shipments there under as any member of a body forwarder.</text>
            <text syncTime="5791.831" offset="23167269">The Commission has indeed changed its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="5795.301" offset="23181166">It's going back to its 1936 position as a result of its most comprehensive investigation of trailer and flatcar services.</text>
            <text syncTime="5803.846" offset="23215334">An investigation made at the time when it is now a reality, at the rate of 1,400,000 trailers a year, whereas in a prior investigation in 1940, piggybacking was just a dream.</text>
            <text syncTime="5816.885" offset="23267474">There was so little bit of going on that we don't even have statistics, nobody kept statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="5823.621" offset="23294433">I submit to you that this case really represents the railroad's traditional position that a coordinated transportation system which is an objective of the National Transportation Policy can be achieved only on their terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="5840.622" offset="23362456">It's no accident that there a very few rail-motor joint rates in existence in this country and that very few piggyback trailers move under rail-motor carrier joint rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5852.408" offset="23409580">In 1941, the railroad industry entered into a consent decree outlying concerted refusal to enter into through routes and joint rates with motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5866.875" offset="23467468">Later in United States against Pennsylvania in 323 U.S., this Court had to sustain the Commission's order requiring the railroads to interchange cars with sea trade thereby making that new technological service feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5885.349" offset="23541342">This case involves more than a lot of questions of technical, highly technical statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5894.506" offset="23578018">It means enabling and encouraging motor carriers to divert their trailers from crowded highways to the excess capacity of the railroad system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5907.639" offset="23630472">And at that time, when the nation is confronted with railroad proposals for a restructuring of the rail system, large -- largely on the ground at intermodal competition, mostly motor carrier competition will continue to provide the competitive leaven in the loaf that therefore railroad should be allowed to achieve the admitted economies of restructuring.</text>
            <text syncTime="5937.672" offset="23750635">We submit that this is no time to interpret the Act in such a way as to enable motor carriers to determine -- the railroads to determine the extent of motor carrier utilization of piggyback services.</text>
