            <text syncTime="35.590" offset="245739">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.732" offset="266324">This case involves two Negro criminal defendants from the State of Georgia, Phil Whitus and Leon Davis who in December 19, 1959 were accused of the crime of murder of a White man in Mitchell County, Georgia, a small South Georgia county.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.292" offset="344586">This case has been pending in one court or another since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.646" offset="361932">After an initial conviction in which the trial -- which they questioned systematic exclusion of Negroes from the juries, was not raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.133" offset="395891">The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the State of Georgia and I recall it came here by certiorari, certiorari denied and then a petition for a writ of writ of habeas corpus filed in the United States District Court in the Southern District of Georgia, denied there.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.774" offset="454510">It then went to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, denied there on the grounds of non-exhaustion of remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.593" offset="473736">That judgment is vacated by this Court and the case went back down to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.502" offset="493380">The District Court again dismissed the petition for habeas corpus back to the Court of Appeals and then it was reversed and the jury box in Mitchell County, Georgia then was condemned, as being racially exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.321" offset="548655">Now, in that opinion by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in which certiorari was denied by this Court, three years ago to this day, the State of Georgia was given eight months after the final judgment of that court in which to try and indict and try -- retry these petitioners before some constitutionally composed jury or tribunal in some place in the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.561" offset="681566">The Fifth Circuit said that the state had eight months in which to do that and that any questions of course would come by regular appeal through the state process.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.498" offset="725347">We are now here alleging that the law of the State of Georgia which requires the selection of jurors from tax digest, which are by statute racially segregated, renders the jury system under which these petitioners were tried invalid and unconstitutional and we secondly allege that there was in fact systematic exclusion of Negroes from the grand and petit jury in Mitchell County, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.330" offset="844675">Now under the facts of this case in Mitchell County, Georgia, we had initially and that the county population by the way, the population of, those who are eligible for jury duty, male citizens over 21 years of age is the figure we were taking here, even though females are eligible to serve in Georgia, very few do and I think it’s a proper statistics because the figures are greater for the total Negro population of the county than they are for Negro males over age 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.869" offset="970898">The percentage is 42% of the population of Mitchell County, Georgia and that is I think the most conservative racial figure that could be used here.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="240.608" offset="1065775">Well then that would be the more accurate statistic?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Morgan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="242.267" offset="1072462">That would be a more accurate statistic of the total number eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.281" offset="1084479">That is not disclosed by the record in this case, that figure is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.935" offset="1111124">Now, according to the evidence in this case, prior to the indictment of these two petitioners, no Negro had ever served on a grand jury in Mitchell County, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.052" offset="1155532">One Negro did serve on this grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.369" offset="1176848">On the trial jury, called at the same time as the grand jury was called, of 90 who were summoned, there were three of the April term report who were Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.376" offset="1236825">The petitioner was not tried then.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.591" offset="1241736">He was not tried into the fall following.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.666" offset="1254066">At that time, 90 jurors were summoned, seven were Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.992" offset="1279352">I think under the rulings of this case -- court including the Swain case a prima facie case was made out on the actual question of systematic exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.818" offset="1318640">But beyond that, we have a far more important question I believe, of the appearance of racially segregated tax digest in the small Southern Courthouse and a system of justice that has been traditionally reserved or administration by White man.</text>

            <text syncTime="2111.293" offset="8548498">I might bring to the Court's attention that the final mandate of this Court was not handed down until January, 1965.</text>

            <text syncTime="2173.530" offset="8797497">However, the respondent would respectfully called to the Court's attention that whereas here, prior discrimination was laid there and then bring to the court's attention that that is the very crux of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals' decision that you have prior discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2831.080" offset="11427715">One or two things --Mr. Justice Fortas, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals did not condemn the use of the tax digest in its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.215" offset="11480273">Its decision was based upon the traditional showing that was made, the fact that the Negroes constituted a substantial portion of the population and the fact that none had ever served.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.753" offset="11526353">Primarily, the Fifth Circuit's determination was based upon a concession or what was tantamount to a concession in the brief of the state which said, “We do n to dispute the issue of discrimination but we rely upon the doctrine of waiver."</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.102" offset="11579747">The Fifth Circuit said, “Construing Fay versus Noia taking judicial notice of the situation on the Southern community, we would say that there is no waiver under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.434" offset="11629066">Well actually, one point that was brought out by Mr. Morgan that Southern states are not the only jurisdictions that have these subjective jury selection statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.327" offset="11668668">This horrible statute of Alabama that he referred to, United States has one almost identical if his reading of it was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.726" offset="11698239">That's 28 U.S.C. A-1861 which says, you must be able to read, write and understand the English language.</text>

            <text syncTime="2938.369" offset="11856854">The first is selecting that is the process of the jury commissioners meeting every two or three years as the court may direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.184" offset="11888097">Taking the tax digest, getting the names from the tax digest of those people that own property and pay taxes and that are thereby qualified, making up the jury boxes as we call them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.484" offset="11933341">Each jury -- there are two jury boxes, there's one for the grand jury and there's one for the petit jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.486" offset="11949328">Each jury box is divided into two compartments, compartments numbers one and two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.338" offset="11972733">The jury commissioners select the petit or the traverse jury box first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.953" offset="11995199">They take the names of the tax digest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.703" offset="12006170">They consider whether these particular people have the qualifications that suit them for jury service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.967" offset="12027277">They then prepare tickets and they put the name of a juror on that ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.519" offset="12045458">They put it in compartment number one of the grand jury box.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.308" offset="12060609">From the grand jury box, they then select two-fifths, not more than two-fifths of those names who will also serve as or rather from the traverse jury box, they select a list of group of names of not more than two-fifths to serve as grand jurors and they are the most experienced and upright and intelligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.077" offset="12135633">To be a traverse jury, you only have to be upright and intelligent but to be a grand jury, you have to be the most experienced, upright and intelligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.001" offset="12175339">These names are placed in the box.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.418" offset="12185057">The names are also given to the clerk of the superior court who records them on the minutes of the court so that there is a permanent record of who is in the jury box and who is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.228" offset="12224240">At the end of each term of court, the judge, the trial judge in open court, draws the names from the jury boxes for the grand and petit juries for the term of court that will follow in that particular circuit or that particular county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.771" offset="12282441">This is a chance process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.837" offset="12290696">He puts his hand down in the box, he pulls it out, he has not discretion to discard it, he has to put the name on the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.296" offset="12324551">And the panels, the panels are made up of 12 each.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.384" offset="12340955">There are 36 for several juries, 24 of these are used in criminal case plus such additional other panels as the court maybe necessary to make up a traverse jury panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.628" offset="12397902">Now, the Georgia statute that's in question here, we have two positions with regard to that statute which is 59106 which says that you go to the tax digest on 926307 which says that the names of Negroes will be listed separately on the tax digest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.709" offset="12478255">We say that that statute is not unconstitutional as applied to jury selection because of the fact that this digests are used at the deliberative stage of the jury selection process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.839" offset="12530709">When the jury commissioners presumably and in fact if they follow the decisions of this Court and most particularly of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, they have to investigate the background of all the jurors including their race.</text>

            <text syncTime="3145.246" offset="12684309">Secondly, we say that the origin of the statute refutes the fact that there was any discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.503" offset="12713357">Now, we recognize that the Ham case has held in a direct suit for injunction, challenging a state law that requires complete separation of names on a poll tax or tax record that such statute would be stricken down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.548" offset="12773543">However, that was made in the context of a case which was a direct challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.963" offset="12795173">That is not true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.031" offset="12799457">There could not be a direct challenge here because the statute was repealed in the 1966 General Assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.830" offset="12826728">There was prior to that, prior to 1965, there was a practice whereby the return sheets upon which the taxpayer actually, each individual taxpayer makes the return of his taxes, they were put on yellow for the Negro taxpayers and white for White taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.830" offset="12894647">That practice was voluntarily abandoned in the first part of 1965 by the State Revenue Department which furnishes these return sheets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.622" offset="12925889">Now, the digest is a consolidation of the returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.578" offset="12937697">A return has just one taxpayer's name on it, but the digest is a consolidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.949" offset="12955146">It has maybe 15 to 20 names on it and it is from the digest that the jurors are selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.102" offset="12991822">Now, the digest itself heretofore has been divided into two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.886" offset="13010944">The first part would be white or perhaps vice versa and the other part would be the Negro.</text>

            <text syncTime="3926.352" offset="15808763">I would also point out that the effect of the reversal on this question would mean that about close to 4900 people in the prison system of Georgia would be subject to habeas corpus because the Fifth Circuit has said that this question can't be raised substantially so in the Fifth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3947.997" offset="15895385">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.473" offset="15929240">With respect to the last statement regarding the number of people that will be automatically released in the event the court reverses on the question of tax digest recall for page 10 of the brief in the Gideon case, the statement or decision referring to the present case of retroactive to allow over 5,000 hardened criminals in Florida to be set free.</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.433" offset="16009070">Our only response -- that was in the Gideon case with the state contended there in brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3981.554" offset="16029550">Here, the state contends that we're going to turn loose over 4,000 Negro prisoners from the state penitentiaries in the event of a reversal here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3988.618" offset="16057866">That argument was not successful in the Gideon case where (Inaudible) had been a specific case which was approved with the law of that case until the Gideon case and our response to that last contention is that if they're in jail wrongfully, they ought to be out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.768" offset="16134457">Now, regarding the historical questions on the statute, we've had historical research done by many in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="4015.391" offset="16164968">There seems to be a split of opinion of -- as to exactly when the anti-Negro voter registration pushed -- came in the south whether it was 1896, 1894 exactly and what year did it take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.591" offset="16221706">There is very little with respect to this particular statute which was proposed as an amendment to the Voter Registration Bill that came along in 1894.</text>
            <text syncTime="4039.442" offset="16261099">There are no racial reference is in the publications in Georgia, the original sources that we've looked to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4044.950" offset="16283146">The Atlanta Constitution of December 8, 1894 on page 4, column 3 in an editorial, stated that after it admits that it's agitated the reform, it says, “The Populist Party dividing the Bill as a body for what purposes, we do not know.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.365" offset="16360782">From some of these purposes -- that time in Georgia, the Populist Party was quite a threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.723" offset="16382307">The Populist Party had not yet attached to itself the doctrines of racism.</text>
            <text syncTime="4074.586" offset="16401742">In Georgia between 1888 and 1903, there were 241 Negroes that were lynched, this is the second state, second only to Mississippi in the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="4085.395" offset="16445001">The problems of race, the problems of voting, the problems of the rise of a new political party in the south which was aligning the interest of Negroes with pro white fractions at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4096.798" offset="16490559">All were en-captured by this legislation that was proposed to the Georgia General Assembly at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.227" offset="16528280">I can't give anything specific though with respect to mention of race in the publications that had done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4110.710" offset="16546252">The Bill, Senate Bill number 130 reports to be retriever of the Georgia Statute requiring segregation on tax digest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4119.166" offset="16580002">I don't quite read it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4120.971" offset="16587212">That statute says, it purports to repeal the statute but then it goes on to say that several tax receivers or tax commissioners shall accumulate such statistical information in regard to taxpayers of such nature as they shall deem to be a benefit to the state revenue commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.858" offset="16650846">So it does reveal the statute and then goes on to talk about statistical information and the compilation of statistical data.</text>
            <text syncTime="4146.906" offset="16690970">Referring to statements made regarding the use of the old list, in the compilation of the new list, as the old condemned jury list, in the record in case number 650 on page 28, has contained the statement that they did use the old list to go through it then they got the -- and then used the tax digest also.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.484" offset="16849272">On this page 28 reference I'm talking about now is -- Solicitor Hand asked the question, “Were you present when the jury list was revised in February 1965?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4199.801" offset="16902562">I think there's a difference between revisions of the list of course and an actual throwing out of the old list, it was started anew from scratch.</text>
            <text syncTime="4210.225" offset="16944253">He -- and one of the references is that there is a denial that the old list was actually used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4215.157" offset="16964002">They just said they went through it and checked of the names and then they came back and I really don't know what the purpose of going through it were if they didn't use -- they seem reports that they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="4225.360" offset="17004857">Now, in the record on page 48 of 253 under examination by Mr. Jones of the city clerk tax collector, let's see.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.082" offset="17159711">The statement is made there, what record have you make use in making this jury list.</text>
            <text syncTime="4266.957" offset="17171205">Well, we used the old list and of course we used the digest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4270.412" offset="17184998">You used the old list and the digest and that was all that you did used?</text>

            <text syncTime="4311.029" offset="17347480">This would be the Acts for 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="4316.079" offset="17367646">Regarding the statistical breakdown of the number of names there, we do have the 500 to 600 names we do in one instance have 90 names drawn out of the box apparently at random.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.962" offset="17431176">We have the names of three Negroes being drawn there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4335.745" offset="17446327">We have 90, the second time being drawn at random apparently from the box.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.274" offset="17464508">We have seven names there and no statistical studies were prepared for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.232" offset="17480286">Of course, we would offer to have such studies prepared in light of the Finkelstein article in the Harvard Law review based on Bernoulli's test and laws of probability.</text>
            <text syncTime="4353.014" offset="17515395">If the Court so desired, we'd be happy to submit them to the Court in a separate memorandum in a later time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4358.994" offset="17539323">The Fifth Circuit -- United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, did call forward seven cases to be argued and back before the Fifth Circuit of which Brooks versus Beto was one and Davis versus Davis Governor was another.</text>
            <text syncTime="4376.477" offset="17609331">Also Rabinowitz versus United States was argued back at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4380.291" offset="17624586">The Rabinowitz case as I understand with regarding discretionary questions and the question of the use of discretion by federal jury commissioners, says that those federal standards are maximum standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.364" offset="17668786">You can oppose other standards over the able to read, write and understand the English language provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4398.025" offset="17695431">As I understand the thrust of these cases, it is somewhat difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.352" offset="17708805">We had the case of Billingsley versus Clayton there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4403.892" offset="17718941">We attempted to bring that to this Court, the cert was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.347" offset="17736808">In order to review it along this field in the Fifth Circuit which is I think the most of the field -- the Circuit most concerned with the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4417.238" offset="17772335">As I understand the thrust of these cases, it is the jury commissioners must be aware of the racial makeup of the entire community in which they operate and they must be aware of this in order to find a cross section as to the -- and the cross section is what is required -- it's required from that list and as I understand the Swain case, it's the list that you've got to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.115" offset="17855822">We can prove the list pretty well statistically by taking the number of names drawn at random from it and moving right straight down to the racial breakdown that we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="4447.876" offset="17894902">Now, the statement that was made an argument, I do want to question one statement about the jury commissioners themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="4466.212" offset="17968253">I didn't quite understand that these jury commissioners knew about it personally that was put on there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4475.074" offset="18003675">As a matter of fact, some of the jury commissioners hardly seem to know very much about anything much that was going on there. The percentage figure that we were talking about earlier with Mr. Justice Fortas under the cross-examination by Mr. Hand, he said, “Mr. Grovin (ph) this is just a wild guess by you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4493.315" offset="18076609">“Yes sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4494.336" offset="18080684">Could it be as high as 80% or 60%?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4497.581" offset="18093746">“Well, it could possibly be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4499.698" offset="18102209">You just don't really know, do you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4502.731" offset="18114330">“I don't know.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4503.905" offset="18119032">“You don't know what the percentages, do you?”</text>

            <text syncTime="4652.840" offset="18714728">Well, I think Mr. Justice Black pointed out that it would be difficult in a small county, a rural county of this nature, for them not to have some knowledge anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="4659.563" offset="18741582">People work on the farm.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Morgan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="4670.257" offset="18784423">Not at the time of selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4671.380" offset="18788916">I think the knowledge should come from some sort of a list.</text>
            <text syncTime="4673.917" offset="18799052">If it comes from a list, it ought to come in a random selection just straight down the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="4677.856" offset="18814830">Now as far as techniques and modes of proof at a later time that you might have in a case, in a city like Birmingham or a city like Atlanta where you have a very large population, the problem of proof is just a tremendous problem and it could very well be that there is -- that there might be some record for that purpose at some place but I don't think the jury commissioner should have that as a consideration in their mind certainly not by state law and certainly not tacked on in a judicial system such as we have where it's just thrust at them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4705.311" offset="18924648">It's like the Andersen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.450" offset="18929142">This maybe told to the jury commissioner, it's almost like saying to him, this is a relevant consideration somehow.</text>
            <text syncTime="4713.363" offset="18956831">If the counsel on both sides are trying to find out why we've got segregated tax digest to begin with and we don't know then what in the world would a jury commissioner think.</text>
            <text syncTime="4721.384" offset="18988910">There must be some reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="4722.298" offset="18992567">There's a reason for everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="4723.119" offset="18995806">I suppose ordinary man think and that reason must be the racial distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4729.514" offset="19021406">To conclude, we would simply say this, a jury was cast upon these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4736.985" offset="19051290">That jury came from fluted Wellspring.</text>
            <text syncTime="4741.196" offset="19068113">We didn't -- we know that over a period of years, this Court has condemned systematic exclusion of Negroes from juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4749.966" offset="19103222">We also know that for period of years, Negroes continued to be excluded from juries in the South.</text>
            <text syncTime="4756.530" offset="19129448">The remedy that we propose under this case is that the state was given eight months to try these defendants fairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.777" offset="19154526">The conviction is unconstitutional based first on the tax digest segregation question as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4767.934" offset="19175111">Secondly, the record discloses systematic exclusion as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4771.921" offset="19191097">The state under the law did nothing, the state under the facts did nothing and it seems to me that the State of Georgia and any other jurisdiction which excludes Negroes from jury as a matter of practice should be advised that you try them fairly and rapidly or they'll go free.</text>
            <text syncTime="4792.034" offset="19271555">We think that these defendants should now be cast out of jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.627" offset="19301857">Thank you sir.</text>
