            <text syncTime="27.337" offset="212720">May it please the court, this case comes here on petition for -- government petition for a writ of certiorari to the Fifth Circuit, which refers respondents conviction for bank robbery because it held that Sixth Amendment right to counsel had been violated in the lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.059" offset="315643">There is a lineup which was held after indictment, as a matter of fact the respondent was arrested after indictment and after counsel had been appointed for him without notification to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.257" offset="392443">It does not appear on the record, but the United States Attorney in the argument before the Court of Appeals conceded that after line-up the persons in the lineup, I think there were six of them that doesn’t appear in the record either, were asked to say some words like, put the money in this bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.061" offset="499649">The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction holding first that the fact alone, that counsel had not been notified of the decision to conduct a lineup was a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel for the defendant and further that because of this violation, the witnesses, the victims of the robbery should not have been allowed to identify the defendant, the respondent in Court at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.248" offset="656384">This despite the fact that the record shows they had quite a lot of time, ample time to observe them at the trial, despite the fact that the record shows that at least one of them had picked out his photographs before the lineup, before his arrest and despite the fact that the government on its own made no attempt to make affirmative use of the fact that defendant had been identified at a lineup, but that the whole question of the lineup was introduced into the case by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.869" offset="838823">It’s the government position that the Court was wrong on both aspects of the decision and that’s why we brought the case here.</text>

            <label>Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="207.491" offset="933386">On the Sixth Amendment question, in our view the key to the problem is that by a line up, that what the government is really seeking, is to find out what the witness knows, the witness, the victims of the robbery not what the defendant knows.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.224" offset="1032234">It really is asking this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.338" offset="1044773">Mr. Witness can you identify this man?</text>
            <text syncTime="239.975" offset="1063267">Now the reason you use the defendant instead of using photographs is because it’s better, you get better testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.210" offset="1092211">If somebody looks at that real thing, than if he looked at a photograph and the reason you use a lineup is that it’s fairer, if you haven’t looked at six people, as the same way then if he just looks at one person, but the question that you are asking is the question of the witness, do you recognize him and this is true whether its before indictment or after indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.376" offset="1224913">Now the most frequent use of a line up of course, is when the arrest is made shortly after the crime, it’s very frequent in day time crimes, robberies, holdups, so on; you get the victims, maybe the robbery has been at night or the holdup is at night and you try to get them identified quickly, so that it’s a technique for helping the police know they’ve the right man.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.624" offset="1325850">Now this case in that sense is atypical.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.930" offset="1339120">But even in this situation it’s the same question, because what happened here was that two accomplices were caught in another bank robbery and they subsequently identified -- they told a story about this bank robbery and named respondent as a person who had gone into the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.615" offset="1445804">Now there are stories checked out in many details as is shown from the transcript which isn’t printed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.475" offset="1473285">But there’s a long record that shows that the story as to all the preparations and so forth were corroborated in quite considerable detail, but only one man went into the bank and they named respondent as that man.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.449" offset="1537128">Well, obviously it was important, both from the point of view of prior preparation and bolstering the point of assurance they you really did have the right man, that the victim who were in the bank, the only people in the bank when he was there, say whether they could identify him or not and so although it was after indictment, it served an identification purpose because those were the two people who had actually seen him at the turn.</text>

            <text syncTime="410.298" offset="1744541">United States Attorney see this argument as we’ve gotten in fact as far as we can, as I understand it there were six people at the lineup all dressed alike and they were told, each told to say the same thing, “Put the money in the bag.”</text>

            <text syncTime="426.074" offset="1807653">Well there were some local police and there was an FBI agent who were responsible for the lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.432" offset="1837119">This wasn’t -- the United States Attorney as such did not participate.</text>

            <text syncTime="438.317" offset="1856658">And I understand about the record, this was not kept side from the trial.</text>

          <turn speaker="beatrice_rosenberg" startTime="442.575" stopTime="681.190">
            <label>Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="442.575" offset="1873690">No this was not kept aside from the trial, all that happened at the trial was the first witness got up, she was the cashier of the bank, she was the one whom the defendant first approached and she testified to the circumstances of the robbery that a man came in, she and -- she was at the cashier’s desk, about 10 feet away from the entrance, she was alone, that a man came in and said I have to check to cash and she said okay, come here.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.750" offset="1994376">And then she looked up and he had a gun pointed at her and then he walked right close to her and said this is a holdup and get the money and then she walked back to the hall where the manager was and she said that Mr. Gray we are being robbed and so the robber said put the money -- he handed her a pillow case, said put the money in here and they did, they put the money and then she -- they both started to go out and the robber said no, you stay back there with Mr. Gray like (Inaudible), but you come with me and I want the money that’s upfront and then he said to Mr. Gray, if you do what you are told you won’t get hurt and so Mr. Gray went around and took the money upfront.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.376" offset="2196877">And then the man left, and one of the accomplices was driving a getaway car.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.506" offset="2229373">Now that’s all that happened, they testified to that and they said do you see that man, and she said, yes, each of them, this man here.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.771" offset="2254451">Well the first witness, she just said I see this man and defense counsel got up and he said something about when did you see it before or something like that and she said, well I identified a photograph.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.787" offset="2318503">That came out by then and then he asked her about the lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.876" offset="2338879">Now defense counsel’s main point at this time is perfectly clear from the record, was to bring out an incident that happened during the lineup, which was that the lineup was conducted in a court room.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.944" offset="2395199">I’m told that -- defense counsel tells me that’s about 60 miles from the place where the bank was robbed and the two witnesses were seated at the benches of court room, I take it about 20 feet and then about where -- as I understand is about where Justice Harlan and Justice Stewart said, there is an empty room from the court room which the witnesses called to pool, apparently an empty room and there is a door to the empty room, well while they were sitting there waiting for the lineup, a door -- (Inaudible) open, it swung open and at that point both of the witnesses said that they saw the FBI agent, Mrs. Gray said with respondent the manager and Mrs. Chamber said, the cashier, the manager said he saw the FBI agent and a man who looked like the man they identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.714" offset="2674186">Mrs. Chamber said this is just a glance and as I say, the manager said, it looked liked that they entered and then the lineup was conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.849" offset="2726745">It’s really all the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.174" offset="2736044">Then what the defense counsel did was argued to the jury that well, how could they be sure and after, when they saw him with the FBI agent, this minute, this glance and how could they be sure and he did make a motion I will say, he did bring out the fact that he was not at the present at the lineup and he did make a motion --</text>

            <text syncTime="800.082" offset="3303737">No he has not been notified of the line up and so it comes to you in a sense on the Fifth, Sixth Amendment problem, -- the question, the Court of Appeals apparently asked counsel about what happened and he told them, and the Court of Appeals referred to the fact that the defendant was asked to speak, but the fact of that didn’t even come out at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.528" offset="3413452">There is not one thing in the record on that, and our petition on the Sixth Amendment is simply that a line up is basically in its function and in the purpose not different from intervening a witness either as an investigation or as preparation for a trial and in neither case on our system of government is that an adversary, cooperative type of thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1647.172" offset="6692028">The inquisitor if you please of the lineup, the entire matter was being handled by Mr. Kenneth Albert of the FBI, he made all the arrangements, he had talked with the witnesses, the witnesses knew him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.272" offset="6756498">According to one witness a photograph had been identified, and I think it’s a reasonable statement to say that the picture was probably taken after the arrest, for the reason that if a competent FBI agent had, had a witness testify that a photograph reflected the robber, that he would have taken some action. So therefore I think it’s a reasonable assumption from the circumstances here, that this picture was taken after the arrest of the defendant, after the appointment of his counsel and that the purpose for this lineup was not for the purpose of merely identification, if it was as counsel stated in its brief, why have the defendant and others repeat statements as admitted by counsel for the government in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.226" offset="6984286">Words identical or words very similar to that used by the robber, such as fill up the bag, they could just as easily have him read a few portions of the constitution or a novel or a newspaper.</text>

            <text syncTime="1746.104" offset="7087835">We do not have the situation as we have is in this Schmerber case, in the Schmerber case by Justice Brennan, we found a blood test taken under hospital conditions by someone of no interest in the case, a disinterested person.</text>

            <text syncTime="1796.128" offset="7287933">But here we have a man required to make statements, similar to those used in the robbery.</text>

            <text syncTime="3531.643" offset="14229922">I just wanted to take up this matter of indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.429" offset="14245073">Very often it is really happened today whether the indictment in return or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.852" offset="14282794">Of course the sooner you get a man in some respect, if you arraign him promptly and recognize his right to a speedy trial, but as soon as you have probable cause you should take step to arraign him, to charge him and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.872" offset="14362833">Obviously a great deal of interviewing of witnesses, preparation, all kinds of tests goes on after indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.541" offset="14409540">Now this case is a little different, the reason for the delay here is different, this was an unsolved crime for a long time, they knew there was a bank robbery, they didn’t know who did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.310" offset="14460635">Then these two men were caught in a quite different bank robbery and eventually, this took them time to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.643" offset="14497938">They talked about this particular robbery and the stories were checked and this is not in the record before the Court, but shows up in the transcript, a lot of their story was checked but as I think I said before according to their story and according to facts of the robbery one man with in the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.237" offset="14588322">Now the indictment was returned before these men were arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.744" offset="14606399">But obviously, the way you see whether the final corroboration of these accomplices was to have the people who where in the robbery look at it, that’s what this lineup was for, if you call it preparation for trail in one sense of course it was but it was also identification in the same way that identification is used where a man is called earlier and that’s why it seems to be an artificial line to try to draw it before or after indictment, so long as the (Inaudilbe) confines himself to finding out what the witness can say and doesn’t try to get information as such for the defendant and that brings me to the subject of the remedy, on that the Court of Appeals below I think stands alone, so far as I know. The defendants in the next case would have said merely that the government could not make affirmative use of the lineup identification, well the government in this case didn’t try to, they didn’t even bring out that the witness had identified photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.304" offset="14924570">This came in originally -- brought in by the defense, what the government relied on was that the witness had really quite a long time to identify the robber and they did identify him in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.625" offset="14977860">The government didn’t bring him in the lineup at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="4010.580" offset="16145742">My question is what remedy could the Court of Appeals have applied in order to vindicate the violation of petitioner’s constitutional rights?</text>

            <text syncTime="4025.643" offset="16205928">Well, there have been two suggestions by defending opinion in the federal Gilbert case about which it held and that in the next case and so forth, by courts that have held that there was violation of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.477" offset="16269249">One suggestion is that the government be barred from affirmatively bringing before the jury and of course that wasn’t done in this case, any evidence that the lineup identification had been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.216" offset="16332257">So that -- because in many cases where it’s very close to time, this may be more significant than it was in this case, that kind of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4067.719" offset="16374262">The other suggestion that has been made for a remedy is Judge Browning (ph) suggestion in the defense in the Federal Gilbert case which is that where a court feels that there has been a violation of right, that there be a hearing outside the presence of the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="4084.929" offset="16443120">A hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine as near as one can, all law requires some weighing, some evidence, how much opportunity did the witness have to see the defendant at that time of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.598" offset="16525772">How certain -- how -- had he identified them before the lineup?</text>
            <text syncTime="4110.104" offset="16543744">In other words, can one say with a reasonable degree of certainty that the identification, the knowledge of the looks of this man came long before the lineup or if it’s so doubtful and are the circumstances such that you can’t honestly say that the identification -- the original identification at the lineup -- suppose the first time you identified him as a lineup, let’s assume it was – that’s very unfair lineup that Mr. Justice Fortas put to me as a hypothetical question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4148.362" offset="16696822">The action there is that in that kind of a situation you’d say well the chances are that his identification in the courtrooms stems from the illegal lineup, we won’t allow him to identify in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="4163.743" offset="16758366">But where the evidence shows very clearly that the witness did have lots of opportunity to observe and that the -- that the lineup legal or illegal was not the major factor, then we will allow the witness to identify in the courtroom, but I presume not show if some question is raised, not allow him to show that he did it three months before or six months before at the lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="4193.663" offset="16878007">And when you considered, that this is not the problem that the Court was dealing with in Miranda, that is rule -- a line up is really basically designed to be there.</text>
