            <text syncTime="10.317" offset="144593">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.523" offset="161416">This wagering tax cases have been extensively brief and argued over the last two terms here and I doubt that in a few minutes anymore can be added.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.641" offset="213974">I would like to mention that it seems apparent now that the Court and counsel are quite aware of some of the broader implications that underlie the decisions in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.577" offset="277713">It's just not all that simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.732" offset="294327">At the one extreme, he might say, “well, part of the tax is plenary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="54.734" offset="322330">And the Congress can exercise it in anyway that it chooses on any subjects that it chooses.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.467" offset="345213">And we don't concern ourselves with Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.157" offset="364022">But the other he might say, “Well the Fifth Amendment is absolute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="69.654" offset="381994">He has the right to remain silent and the Government can't violate that no matter what parts excise on.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.353" offset="416789">But we don't think that either of those positions is sound as we read the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.963" offset="459212">The Court has taken a position of accommodation when flight – when it's face put the clash such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.555" offset="497560">And our effort has been to suggest several alternatives that we think would provide a sensible accommodation in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.435" offset="537161">As far as we know, no prior decision of this Court is held a tax invalid on Fifth Amendment grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.164" offset="567986">Indeed, as far as we know, the Court is consistently upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.777" offset="590451">Excise taxation of businesses whether they are illegal or legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.306" offset="616573">It's consistently upheld the taxation of income from unlawful as well as lawful sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.562" offset="657638">We submit therefore that against this back draft of the President of sensible accommodation here is – is a necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="196.162" offset="888038">I think there are different positions that could be developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.574" offset="901622">Professor Wright mentioned yesterday that we suggested just in passing our brief that perhaps, one of the problems here is the fact that forms prescribed are hardly neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.251" offset="964420">How they answer that we gave to the question post by the Court as to whether these forms had to be filled out, filed the presently prescribed forms was, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.892" offset="1018964">Professor Wright apparently feels and we suggest that this maybe another way to reach this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.572" offset="1045608">It's not a way that seems to me is presently often at the Court because this kind of information seems compelled by the statutes and the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.379" offset="1080926">It maybe that if the statutes and the regulations could be amended in appropriate way.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.997" offset="1099316">This would be another way that the Congress could still tax in system with the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.128" offset="1123871">I think there are some difficulties with that also but it is another variant.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.846" offset="1158771">I would like to enclosing -- just go quickly back over what the substance of the contention made here for unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.343" offset="1212792">Now, petitioners don't deny that there are gamblers that essential of their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.941" offset="1239124">They don't say that the wager and taxes in a tax measure because they recognized that that was one of the questions presented in the Court in a petition for certiorari and it was not taken on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.753" offset="1306415">What they say is that they're excuse from compliance with the wager and tax laws because the business in which they're engage is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.492" offset="1357302">They say therefore, compliance with these laws would require them to incriminate themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="1351.262" offset="5508472">It seems to us that that provides a sensible view as to this scope of Shapiro.</text>

            <text syncTime="1391.483" offset="5669282">Because if you say that and it seems to me, the Government can require almost any kind of report or return to be made and that information could be use against an individual to prove his guilt of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.997" offset="5727378">And since there aren't any sensible stopping places along that line that we can divide.</text>

            <text syncTime="1580.206" offset="6424221">In six hours of real argument, nine briefs these cases have ranged far and we've speculated them in good many interesting things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.439" offset="6457135">There is I think one fundamental proposition of constitutional law that is central to the petitioner's case and that I think does help to resolve some difficulties we've had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.347" offset="6504782">It's a proposition this Court has stated placed dozen times in different ways to particular formulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.680" offset="6526098">I code this from the Pry v. United States from 195 US.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.984" offset="6547310">The Court there said, “The taxing power conferred by the Constitution knows no limits except those expressly stated in that instrument.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.723" offset="6582314">Now I introduce from that three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.138" offset="6591927">First, that except was the Constitution itself says XY taxes must be uniform and there are other constitutional limitation of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.652" offset="6629961">There is no limit whatever on the taxing power of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.824" offset="6646680">In response to the question from Mr. Justice Fortas yesterday I said specifically that I think Congress has the power to tax wagering as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.526" offset="6677504">I think Congress has the power to tax robbery, kidnapping, anything that wants to tax is valid qualified of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.663" offset="6710000">But the other hand from great proposition is that the taxing power must acknowledge those limits expressly stated from the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.569" offset="6741661">And the limit presently relevant is the privilege against self incrimination of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.064" offset="6763604">Congress can tax whatever it wants to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.383" offset="6776874">But it must device a way of doing so that does not require persons to accuse themselves of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.845" offset="6810728">I do not think that these are irreconcilable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.414" offset="6829014">For over half a century, the most important of our federal taxes, the income tax has been successfully administered even though it is not contended that the person is required to incriminate themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.238" offset="6876348">The Sullivan Dictum is respected by the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.150" offset="6899963">The taxpayer's private records are not regarded as coming with the Shapiro Principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.111" offset="6919816">Yet we enforced the tax, if we have a reconciling some taxpayers who does not play forward his records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.522" offset="6957432">The Government had no difficulty by netork prosecutions in other means in penalizing the violator and collecting the revenue of this due te.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.633" offset="6997870">I think that there are ways that the wagering tax could be collected without requiring gamblers to come forward and say, “I am person who has done an unlawful act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.231" offset="7032247">We suggest that some of them are in brief in all our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.696" offset="7050115">I do not think that the Government simply because it needs revenues entitled to say that the person you must be a witness against yourself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.869" offset="7086895">I was suggested yesterday that perhaps this case is an aide for certiorari case from Albertson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.572" offset="7113644">I submit that it is that waits so far as the Government's attempt to then Kahriger and Lewis concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.488" offset="7141334">The Government's other argument, its attempt to the use restriction argument phrases different problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.670" offset="7166098">I think perhaps the used restrictions is a constitutional way that this tax can be collected though as I indicated yesterday, I have the gravest doubt as to propriety of the use restriction being imposed by this Court.</text>
