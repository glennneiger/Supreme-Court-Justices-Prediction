            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">I have the opinion and the judgment of The Court in Richard Swann against Tom Adams, Secretary of State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.284" offset="37094">On March 19, 1966 State of Florida reapportioned the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.380" offset="61440">The new plan called the 48 senators and 117 representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.530" offset="82024">Senate districts range in size from 87,000 to 114,000, or from 15% over the average and 10% into the average with a ratio of 1.3:1 between the largest and the smallest district.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.980" offset="139912">The deviation from average is over 15% in one district, 14% in five others, and more than 10% and still 6 six others, the variation is among else districts are somewhat more severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.235" offset="188918">The District Court without articulating any reasons for the variations to this magnitude approved the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.022" offset="212010">We reverse while Reynolds and Sims and other cases in the reapportionment area have recognized that legislative districts need not be mathematically equal in population, and that minor variations are acceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.724" offset="274808">None of these cases has approved variations of the magnitude involved in this case, at least without acceptable justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.504" offset="305946">Here neither the State nor the District Court made any serious efforts to explain or justify the particular deviations which this reapportionment plan presents.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.393" offset="345548">We therefore reverse without reaching any of the other objections which the appellants have presented to the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.704" offset="374805">Mr. Justice Harlan has asked me to announce that he has filed the dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Stewart has joined.</text>
