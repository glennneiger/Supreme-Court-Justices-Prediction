            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="12.302" offset="152534">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.821" offset="166640">This appeal from the Supreme Court of Illinois presents the question whether Illinois constitutionally require an out-of-state mail order seller to collect the used tax which Illinois levies upon its residents subsequent use of goods purchased at retail, where the out-of-state seller has neither a place of business nor property nor salesman nor any other kind of representative within the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.578" offset="293700">The facts are very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.490" offset="301328">Appellant is a mail order house with its only offices and warehouse in Kansas City, Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.944" offset="327137">Twice a year it sends out through the mail would-be purchasers in Illinois and elsewhere, catalogues seeking purchasers for its goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.275" offset="372485">Now the catalogues are simply deposited in the mail, other fliers which were small sales book are sent out occasionally through the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.020" offset="411460">The would-be purchasers write in to the Kansas City office where their orders are accepted or rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.895" offset="438941">The orders which are accepted are delivered usually to the United States mails in Kansas City, but occasionally to a common carrier like the American Railway Express and they are thus delivered to the purchasers in all of the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="100.462" offset="505187">Just a matter of interest what kinds of merchandise do they sell?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="103.672" stopTime="337.154">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="103.672" offset="518040">A wide variety of merchandise including books, but a large part of it is dry goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.597" offset="549804">Illinois since 1955 has levied a use tax upon costumer's use of goods purchased at retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.819" offset="598601">And it requires retailers maintaining a place of business in Illinois to collect the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.548" offset="629530">Originally, Illinois gave a customary meaning to retailers maintaining a place of business in Illinois, but in 1961 it added the artificial definition whose constitutionality is an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.833" offset="698702">The provision appears on page 2 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.268" offset="712495">It provides that retailer maintaining a place of business in this state shall include engaging and soliciting orders within this state from users by means of catalogues or other advertisings.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.543" offset="769546">In effect therefore, what Illinois is asserting is the right to impose upon an out-of-state seller the duty to collect the tax even so it is never been within the jurisdiction and does nothing more than send advertising through the mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.881" offset="834853">Of course that provision alone couldn't possibly be enforced by usual methods of collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.275" offset="860453">So having created one fiction, Illinois had to create another fiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.569" offset="877693">It provided that those who were deemed to be doing -- maintaining a place of business in Illinois, when they weren't, should also be deemed to consent to the Secretary of State being their agent for the service process, when in fact of course they had given no such incent.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.033" offset="951463">I don't suggest that the artificiality of those provisions in any way makes them unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.388" offset="976959">Illinois can say its black and it's white if it wishes, but I do submit that the artificiality of the definition shouldn't obscure what Illinois is actually doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.774" offset="1026487">Relying on the statute in question, Illinois first assessed Texas beginning with the effective date of the amendment against the appellant, and then later brought suit by service upon the Secretary of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.292" offset="1084583">We entered a special appearance and preserved our rights throughout the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.704" offset="1106213">The trial judge granted the appellant's motions for summary judgment and the Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.704" offset="1138186">It stated the case in our judgment entirely fairly and finding that we had no property, no representatives, no place of business, no nothing if I may put it that way in Illinois, it said nevertheless the regular sending of advertising through the mails was enough to permit Illinois to impose these extra territorial obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.399" offset="1241004">There are two other facts which I must emphasize.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.372" offset="1260857">One of them was stated by a special subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee that it made an exhaustive, much the most exhaustive study in state taxation of interstate commerce, and which emphasized that it must be brought in mind that efforts to subject mail are to sales, to sales taxation involve not only the major houses, but also a large number of much smaller businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.769" offset="1366497">We're not talking here about Sears and Montgomery Ward.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.680" offset="1382066">They have retail outlets in almost every jurisdiction and therefore it clearly subject to their power.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.268" offset="1412472">We're talking about firms like the appellant which is 133rd besides in mail order sale of Wards, and about an even larger number --</text>

            <text syncTime="345.759" offset="1486451">I can't help thinking of a typical person affected by this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.750" offset="1506408">My neighbor who used to have a mail order business in Massachusetts, he had five employees during most of the year.</text>

            <text syncTime="371.259" offset="1588433">As I understand it, this case does possibly in a way involve a distinction between sporadic and limited mailings and a regular course of periodic mailings plus occasional mailings, but here --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="389.938" stopTime="402.911">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="389.938" offset="1663143">Here, our regular mailings were twice a year, and then there were smaller sales books.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.507" offset="1685400">I think that's customary with nearly all mail ordered businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.257" offset="1700446">Of course some of them appear weekly in the New York Times, we all see them.</text>

          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="402.911" stopTime="428.220">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="402.911" offset="1714970">For example that I suppose this case would might be different from situation in which a department store, let's say, in New York City sells by mail to some extent, X-extent whatever it may be, to costumers in New Jersey or Connecticut or the district.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="428.220" stopTime="496.311">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="428.220" offset="1816221">Yes, but I would think when -- when one can do the kind of advertising that many department stores do such as Masons of the Harvard Cooperative Society, where they send out sometimes in the newspaper regular advertising once a week or oftener that that was in substance indistinguishable from this case, as we think the regularity of the advertising in Miller and Maryland was indistinguishable from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.609" offset="1917785">Now the second fact that I wanted to emphasize in particular is that if Illinois can impose this obligation, so can every other sales or use tax state.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.930" offset="1971075">We're not talking here about an obligation running to a single state.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.224" offset="1988315">We're talking about whether a mail order business of moderate size or smaller size which regularly sends out its catalogues two or three times a year, merely because it puts its catalogues in the mail for national consumer market, can be required to collect used taxes for 10, 20 perhaps as many as 40 or 42 today, sales to the used tax states.</text>

            <text syncTime="499.190" offset="2100120">Is it common?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="500.584" stopTime="702.461">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="500.584" offset="2105657">There are 17 states which now have legislation of this kind on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.558" offset="2129586">It may have gone up slightly, but 17 is the figure that sticks in my mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.803" offset="2146617">There is almost no state which in fact takes steps to enforce it today.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.659" offset="2170023">Most of the state sales tax administrators testified before this special committee I referred to, that they didn't think they had the power to impose this kind of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.439" offset="2213177">But it's on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.604" offset="2217775">There is not slightly -- slightest doubt that it would be enforced if this case were to be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.965" offset="2251212">We submit that the statute is unconstitutional and that the judgment below should be reversed, because it violates both the due process and interstate commerce clauses of the federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.598" offset="2313801">Our first point is that the decision below is contrary to the governing precedence in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.765" offset="2346402">The issue as the Chief Justice pointed out in the American Oil case a few terms ago, is one of nexus.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.762" offset="2374405">Is -- there's some definite connection between the state and the person on whom it seeks to lay the burden?</text>
            <text syncTime="575.923" offset="2407111">Now when you read the cases you will find that they draw a very sharp line of distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.606" offset="2433755">When the foreign corporation has their place of business, a retail outlet or salesman or solicitors of any kind within the state, then the Court has sustained jurisdiction to require seller collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.398" offset="2500942">But where there is only regular advertising, and just as regular as in this case, plus delivery across state line the Court has held that there was no jurisdiction to impose seller collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.050" offset="2551620">There are two cases that I would call attention to particularly, because they seem to me to come very close to the point and one of them plainly draws the very line on which we rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.829" offset="2602715">I refer first to Nelson against Sears, Roebuck.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.816" offset="2618598">There the court sustained Iowa's jurisdiction to require Sears to collect the used tax on mail order sales, but it didn't because Sears had retail outlets doing a local business in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.933" offset="2695084">The opinion is very clear on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.433" offset="2705115">Justice Douglas referred to the fact that Sears had those stores and then said that since Iowa has extended to it, that is Sears, that privilege of having the retail stores, Iowa can exact this burden as a price of enjoying the full benefits flowing from its Iowa business, and of course we don't have any such stores or any other kind of local business.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.239" offset="2804276">Then he went on to advert to the situation of the mail order seller that has no retail stores and said very explicitly “Unlike respondent, they are not receiving benefits from Iowa for which it has power to exact price.”</text>
            <text syncTime="692.728" offset="2874284">And that line drawn in that case is the very one on which we stand here.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.403" offset="2901034">The second case to which I would -- which I would particularly emp --</text>

            <text syncTime="702.461" offset="2913259">General, may I ask you about that case?</text>
            <text syncTime="705.852" offset="2926738">Does Sears collect this tax in other states than Iowa where it does not have any stores?</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="716.045" offset="2967594">I don't -- the -- as far as I know the situation is the one found by the special House Committee that collection of sales and used taxes is virtually unknown, those are the Committee's words.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.709" offset="3022242">In states where a seller does only a mail order business of the practice right across the board has been to adhere to the distinction which I submit derives properly from the Sears case.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.372" offset="3076890">Now the second case that seems to us to be controlling in principle was Miller and Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.560" offset="3105625">There, Miller was a furniture store located in Wilmington and therefore necessarily fairly near the Maryland line.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.516" offset="3137390">It set out advertising, regular advertising, four times a year to address the costumers in Maryland as well as in Delaware of course, and it advertised daily, Mr. Justice Fortas, in Wilmington papers circulating in Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.679" offset="3202069">Costumers came to the store normally to select their merchandise, but the merchandise was delivered by Miller's trucks driven by Miller's employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.946" offset="3247208">The court held nevertheless that there was no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.719" offset="3262255">Now we say if continuous regular advertising plus delivery with your own trucks is not enough to make jurisdiction, but then surely where you don't make delivery with your own truck take away that point of contact and the advertising alone cannot be a sufficient jurisdiction.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="1120.002" offset="4583424">Second -- second reason is the divergences among the laws of the different states which are very wide and very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.323" offset="4624697">Even in the rate of tax, there are eight different taxes today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.940" offset="4651133">They are different in the roads for counting as applied to any one who has credit sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.105" offset="4671822">You make reports with different kinds and to different arrangements for auditing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.354" offset="4704737">The most dramatic illustration of course is in terms of exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.485" offset="4725321">How is the seller in one place of business, regarding he can do it, but think of the enormous burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.862" offset="4750817">It's an impossible burden of keeping track of the different exemptions under the laws of different state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.402" offset="4772968">Now it may be said well the sellers don't have to pay any attention to the exemption, but that still results in discrimination against those who engage in interstate transactions whether the burden falls on the buyer or on the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.493" offset="4833364">Then there's a third burden that is not applicable to the local merchant, and that is that the out-of-state seller has a far greater -- the out-of-state seller is simply not able to collect the tax with the same fees that the local merchant can do with someone standing there face to face with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.929" offset="4935137">This is again well documented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.254" offset="4948407">The special subcommittee found that the rate of non-collection ranged from 30 to 75%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.996" offset="4979336">Our own experience is that we've been unable to collect in an average of 40% of the cases, where our local stores, we do have three states in which we have local stores, make it our obligation to collect the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.335" offset="5036701">40% of the cases on a 3.5% sales tax comes to your paying virtually a 1% gross receipts tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.533" offset="5073481">And this results of course from the fact that the man is far away and he sends in the money for his order and it doesn't include the tax pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.204" offset="5112142">And while you may bill him, you just don't get the money back and it's a small sum and then the laws falls on the seller, so that I think for those three reasons, but especially because of the multiplicity of burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.936" offset="5167104">You do have an obligation that results in discrimination against the out-of-state seller.</text>

            <text syncTime="2167.378" offset="8772838">As indicated by Mr. Cox, National Bellas Hess twice yearly sends into Illinois two major catalogues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.787" offset="8814529">These catalogues contain approximately, each catalogue, approximately 4000 items of merchandise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.740" offset="8842324">They are sent into Illinois with the obvious purpose of soliciting sales in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.587" offset="8869700">In addition to these catalogues, National sends in to Illinois sales books and flyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.443" offset="8905122">Now in this point there appears to be some dispute as to the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.726" offset="8918288">In the reply brief, page 3 of National's reply brief on footnote 2, they seem to take some offense that our statement of the record and claimed that we have misstated the record by intimating that some advertising was done other than by catalogue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.447" offset="9009194">I respectfully suggest to the Court that the record supports the fact and as a matter of fact now in oral argument Mr. Cox did allude to the fact that sales books or flyers were sent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.596" offset="9045765">I suggest that the record is replete the answer on pages 54, 55 and 58 of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.755" offset="9074395">Affidavits by two of its vice presidents, by National's vice presidents, contained at pages 68, 69 and 70, pages 32 and 33, referred to catalogues, sales books and flyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.989" offset="9131342">And as a matter of fact go on to distinguish as I would now that the sales books and flyers in addition to being sent to costumers are sent to addresses with addressees designated merely as “occupant”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.486" offset="9197275">The record further indicates that these sales books or flyers are usually included with merchandise sent into the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.955" offset="9235205">I think this bears particular significance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.280" offset="9252446">National, in the posture of this case had an excess of $2 million in sales in a period of approximately 15 to 15 and one half months.</text>

            <text syncTime="3138.490" offset="12657351">However, and this would be the point I would make, I think the reason states have recently enacted this legislation does bear upon the policy considerations and does portray National in a little different light.</text>

            <text syncTime="3344.032" offset="13479476">Yes we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.116" offset="13495881">I like for a moment to turn in conclusion to the cases real briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.511" offset="13529422">National places tremendous reliance upon the Miller case and I think that this reliance is somewhat misplaced, and I think it's somewhat misplaced because National's failed to appreciate the particular facts in Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.694" offset="13578115">I'd like to briefly mention some five distinctions in Miller which I think sufficiently distinguish Miller from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.620" offset="13605804">First of all, National in its brief and now again in its oral argument refers to the regular deliveries in Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.043" offset="13639555">Conversely, the Court in deciding Miller specifically referred to these deliveries as occasional deliveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.925" offset="13671111">Again, Mr. Justice Clark in writing the Scripto decision referring to Miller, again referred to the “occasional deliveries” in Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.058" offset="13707577">Again, in its reply brief at page 3, National refers to the regular mailings in Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.193" offset="13736103">Conversely, this Court in deciding Miller referred to the occasional sales circulars in Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.963" offset="13775182">National fails to make a distinction which is I think quite failing in Miller, and that is that in the Miller case the buyers left the State of Maryland, went in to the State of Delaware and at the vendor's stores made the purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.016" offset="13835473">They do not particularly give any credence to this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.852" offset="13846758">However, the majority of the court in writing Miller specifically noted that the seller in the Miller case did not know where the goods were to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.768" offset="13886464">Now Mr. Justice Douglas in writing a dissent felt otherwise and believed that the seller should've known where they were used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.420" offset="13909034">The fact remains that whether or not he did or did not know was pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.158" offset="13928051">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3461.103" offset="13947800">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.186" offset="13964100">I want first to emphasize one factor which slipped through my mind during my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.571" offset="13993671">And that is that the logic of the appellee's contention here would plainly open one who does business in a single locality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.202" offset="14040168">Not only do these multiplicities obligations to a large number of states, but also to the used taxes levied by hundreds of local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.739" offset="14090324">Just erring this isn't -- this isn't theory, while we were preparing our brief in this case, we received the demand from Washington, Parish Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.506" offset="14133373">Earlier, when this Court first decided the sales used tax cases, this wasn't a local subdivisions way of raising revenue, but today this would mean that one who sent out catalogues through the mails, and that's all we do and later delivered the goods, would have to figure out in what subdivision these various buyers live so as to collect its used tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.671" offset="14242043">And I submit there is no way on appellant's theory -- at appellee's theory that these cases can be distinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.833" offset="14274748">Our second distinction which my Brother clearly does in prayers but -- which finally would be invalid is one that rested upon whether it was catalogues as the Book of the Month Club advertising or Macy's advertising in newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.907" offset="14335039">The Book of the Month Club advertising is more regular, more systematic, more frequent than ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.073" offset="14363669">The final point to which I want to take time to address the Court's attention here is one that we touched upon earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.674" offset="14402017">And that is, I do submit that to hold that whoever uses -- I'm afraid my time --</text>

            <text syncTime="3587.777" offset="14454471">To hold that whoever uses the mails to circulate advertising and deliver goods and thus gains economic advantages within a state, or use of common carrier for that matter within a state, is subject to regulation or taxation or tax burden as hereby it, would open the door to all kinds of -- of reprisals and economic aggressions that the constitution was enacted to prohibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.921" offset="14607026">And I advert to the example I used a moment ago of Massachusetts taxing Florida hotels because Northeast Airlines is the Florida hotels representative to carry Massachusetts residents down to Florida where the Florida hotels get economic advantages from Massachusetts.</text>
