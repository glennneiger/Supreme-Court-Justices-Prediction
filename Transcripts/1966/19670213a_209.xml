            <label>Mr. Amos M. Mathews</label>
            <text syncTime="11.130" offset="147937">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.707" offset="166222">Petitioner brought this action in United States District Court for a declaratory judgment that a Chicago ordinance is invalid on its face, a reason of conflict with the Interstate Commerce Act and the Commerce Clause of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.191" offset="252113">The city and the other respondents who are officials of the city filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.667" offset="294013">The District Court dismissed in response to that motion and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.532" offset="325465">This Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.370" offset="340825">Some of the issues in this case were presented to this Court are issues similar to those in this case, were presented to this Court in 1958 in Chicago against Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway Company, 357 U.S.77.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.087" offset="431731">In order to understand the issues in this instant case, it is necessary to refer very briefly to some of the facts in that earlier litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.477" offset="493275">Petitioner is engaged under a contract with the Chicago Railroads in transferring passengers between railroad stations in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.892" offset="534967">It frequently happens that a passenger engaged on a through journey through Chicago must transfer from his incoming to his outgoing railroad station.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.060" offset="595571">The petitioner furnishes that service in specially designed buses.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.723" offset="622216">The petitioner receives ultimate remuneration from the railroads that passenger pays nothing to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.158" offset="664012">Prior to 1955, this interstation transfer service had been performed for many years by the Parmelee Transportation Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.615" offset="725870">During the time that Parmelee performed the service, the service was regulated by the City of Chicago along with taxicab service and other similar services by what is known as Chapter 28 of the Municipal Code of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.920" offset="807058">On June -- in June of 1955, the railroads notified Parmelee that as of October 1 of that year, they would discontinue using Parmelee service and would use petitioner instead.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.279" offset="892531">About a month later in July of 1955, the City Council of Chicago passed an amendment to Chapter 28 that I've already mentioned, that imposed two very serious obstacles or barricades to petitioner and the railroads in their expectation of launching the new service.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.178" offset="1012067">In the first place the amendment gave what amounted due a perpetual franchise to Parmelee to perform the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.536" offset="1057520">Secondly, it provided that a newcomer to the field, such as petitioner, must prove to the satisfaction of the public vehicle license commissioner of the City of Chicago that public convenience and necessity required the new service.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.432" offset="1149053">This Court in the Atchison case that I've mentioned held the amendment to Chapter 28 invalid because in conflict with the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.996" offset="1207359">I'd like to mention briefly here that the evidence shows in that earlier case and it is set out both in the opinion of this Court and in the opinion of the Court of Appeals which this Court affirmed, that this action of the Chicago City Council in amending Chapter 28 as I've said, was a well-planned, well-conceived scheme to keep -- to perpetuate Parmelee in the service and to keep -- and to put petitioner out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.847" offset="1402755">After the decision of this case in the Atchison -- after the decision in the Atchison case by this Court in 1958, that restored the status quo regulatory wise that had prevailed as to this interstation transfer service before the 1955 Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.591" offset="1513723">In other words, in order to leave regulation or have regulation of the same type that had covered Parmelee for many years, all the City of Council had to do was simply do nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.529" offset="1577462">But shortly after -- a few months after the mandate came down in the former Atchison case, the Chicago City Council started on a course of amendment of Chapter 28 again to the great detriment of petitioner and the Chicago Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.950" offset="1683205">The Council amended Chapter -- Section 28-6 of Chapter 28 by requiring that annually a person desiring a license to operate as a public passenger vehicle must file an application with the -- well, they already had to file an application but it amended those application proceedings to provide that a person filing an application must prove to the satisfaction of the Public Vehicle License Commissioner that the applicant was qualified to pursue the occupation of a cabman or a coachman.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.422" offset="1889050">Now that phrase qualified to pursue the application of a cabman or a coachman included petitioner within its scope because petitioner was defined as a coachman in the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.966" offset="1943280">It also included taxicabs for the most part but taxicabs operators already had to prove that they -- the public convenience and necessity before conducting any operation since they were an intrastate operation, presumably that was valid, at least it's never been challenged as to the taxicabs.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.086" offset="2043695">In other words, this Amendment in 1959 to Section 28-6 the -- almost the entire force of it fell up on the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.249" offset="2100328">This phrase qualified to pursue the occupation of a coachman was not in any sense, could not -- cannot in any sense, we submit, be considered a regulation within the legitimate police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.051" offset="2171591">It gave a discretion to the Public Vehicle License Commissioner to -- in his discretion, deny the application for a certificate to perform this service.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.942" offset="2231150">And so we say that -- and we cited the only case we can find on the point, the decision of the Supreme Court of Tennessee that the phrase “qualified to pursue the occupation” is a -- in substance a part of the proof that has to be made in proving public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.742" offset="2330311">So the Chicago City Council got back on the old -- in 1959, got back on the old 1955 track.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.736" offset="2370330">The Council amended another section, Section 28-31 of Chapter 28 required taxicab operators to furnish annually to the Public Vehicle License Commissioner a detailed financial statement showing profit and loss and all of the detailed information that and of a -- an intrastate operator subject to the jurisdiction of the City Council would need to submit for the purpose of rate regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.499" offset="2529364">But the Council by a very clear and direct amendment to that provision required or made that provision applicable to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.057" offset="2595610">In other words, it's something that the petitioner whose sole responsibility as to the railroads to -- it's furnishing the same kind of financial data to the Commissioner as taxicab operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.793" offset="2650572">Now --</text>

            <label>Mr. Amos M. Mathews</label>
            <text syncTime="662.402" offset="2752972">Respondents now in their brief on the merits, in this Court, concede that these two provisions, these two amendments that I've detailed cannot be applied to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.356" offset="2816815">Now they did not make that concession in their brief opposing certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.351" offset="2840743">In our petition for certiorari, we made the same argument in respect to these two amendments that we now make in our petition -- in our brief on the merits and that I have outlined briefly in argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.852" offset="2902810">So -- but for the first time in their brief on the merits, respondents say that these two provisions cannot be enforced against petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.390" offset="2960906">Now either that concession means that the amendments are not applicable in terms to petitioner or it means that they cannot lawfully be applied to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.609" offset="3033840">Now we submit that the two amendments are just as clearly and precisely applicable to petitioner in their wording as an arrow hitting a bull's eye.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.686" offset="3094131">Therefore we say that this concession must mean that respondents are admitting that these two amendments are invalid on their face as applied to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.326" offset="3152645">Now answering your question, Mr. Chief Justice, the -- we have spelled this out in detail in our brief but I think I can summarize it quite --</text>

            <text syncTime="808.464" offset="3337279">Among the definitions in Chapter 28, are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.618" offset="3357863">A person is defined as an individual, a firm, or a corporation, so that before the Amendment I'm referring to the taxicab Amendment -- the taxicab financial statement provision applied to taxicab operators who either were individuals or partnerships, or corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.970" offset="3451277">It applied that plainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.393" offset="3456920">Now the City Council in bringing Parmelee -- bringing petitioner within the scope of that Amendment, used the word and made it applicable to every corporation that is a public passenger vehicle.</text>

            <text syncTime="1704.486" offset="6921279">At the very outset, the city would like to make it clear that it fully understands the opinion of this Court in Atchison.</text>

            <text syncTime="1728.436" offset="7017096">In that case, this Court held at pages 88 and 89, the city retains considerable authority to regulate how Transfer vehicles shall be operated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.948" offset="7067146">It could hardly be denied for example, that such vehicles must obey traffic signals, speed limits, and other general safety regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.031" offset="7111450">Similarly, the city may require registration of these vehicles and exact reasonable fees for their use of the city streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.560" offset="7145618">All we hold here and all we construe the Court of Appeals as holding is that the city has no power to decide whether Transfer can operate a motor vehicle service between terminals for the railroads because this service is an integral part of Interstate Railroad Transportation authorized and subject to regulation under the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.775" offset="7242480">It is not the city which is attempting to avoid this Court's opinion in Atchison, but rather it is Railroad Transfer which has been dissatisfied with the outcome of the litigation in Atchison which struck down only Section 28-31.1 relating to public convenience and necessity and sustained the entire remainder of the chapter, it's Transfer which has begun this litigation anew in its attempt to accomplish what it failed to accomplish when the first litigation took place.</text>

            <text syncTime="2044.827" offset="8282676">And the Court of Appeals had complained that our ordinance was invalid because it did not provide for some administrative hearing before there might be consideration given to revocation of licenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="3684.136" offset="14839933">Well, now what we say, as I said before the -- in as much as the Court of Appeals held that valid, that to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals would be to affirm a legal situation that the city now concedes -- cannot be applied to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.284" offset="14912554">Then in respect to the financial statement Section 28-31, I quote, “Section 28-31 was designed to apply only to taxicab operators for use in determining rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.599" offset="14969814">It does not apply to petitioner”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.392" offset="14976920">The trouble of it is, the Court has held that it applies to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.759" offset="14990399">The Courts upheld this requirement of filing financial statements, I mean the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.366" offset="15012864">So you have a direct conflict here between the opinion of the Court of Appeals and these concessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.034" offset="15039509">That is why we say on these two points, there must be a vacation or a reversal to line up the judges so that the District Court may enter a judgment in accordance with these concessions which we submit are correct statement of the law, that they can't make us prove annually that we are qualified and they can't make us furnish these financial statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.031" offset="15151522">Now, one thing I overlooked doing in my opening argument was to call attention to the fact which probably is unnecessary that the Chicago Terminal Railroads with the permission of the Court have filed a brief as a friend of the Court urging reversal of this cause and advising the Court that they have precisely the same interest in this case as petitioner had because petitioner is in effect the alter ego of the railroads under 202 (c) that Mr. Justice Douglas mentioned and in the holding of this Court in the Atchison case.</text>
