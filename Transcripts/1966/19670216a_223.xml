            <text syncTime="2062.635" offset="8353938">It was on February 26th that Gilbert said in effect he did not want to discuss anything about California but would be willing to talk about Philadelphia and that Shanahan indicated that he is interested in some bank robberies that had occurred in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.185" offset="8432097">He suspected that Gilbert might be involved in them and would Gilbert talk about those loosely or freely interpreting the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.627" offset="8469922">And it was in the course of that discussion that Gilbert gave the hand printing samples and the handwriting expert gave his qualified opinion that there was a link between the hand printing samples and the writing or printing on a diagram of the robbery scene that was found at -- in Gilbert's apartment in the Los Angeles area.</text>

            <text syncTime="2147.948" offset="8695202">I don't believe the record which -- well, there was some evidence -- effort by the people as I recall to introduce some statements that Gilbert made and the Court excluded those statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.514" offset="8777435">I would have to double check them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.865" offset="8790810">Of course they were excluded but I think they were excluded on the basis that Gilbert at that time definitely indicated he wanted a counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.053" offset="8843577">Now, whether that would give the answer to Your Honor's questions, I don't this moment recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.942" offset="8887150">Well, the -- there was testimony at any rate that the filing of the hand printing samples here in Washington was in the same category as taking and keeping fingerprints on file.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.565" offset="8945664">And we would submit that that's an illuminating piece of testimony that -- it's in the same category as taking and keeping fingerprints on file.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.643" offset="8981922">In other words, it points up the identification aspect of taking handwriting exemplars and lends emphasis to our position that handwriting is no more and no less than an essential, physical characteristic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.417" offset="9109086">We would urge that the giving of the exemplars in the case at bar involves no testimonial compulsion which is a predicate for invoking the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.708" offset="9158196">Gilbert was not required to verify the authenticity of this hand printing on the exemplars that was provided by Agent Shanahan who's -- for whom Gilbert filled out the exemplars, and he was not -- Gilbert was not compelled to disclose that the writing on the diagram was his.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.800" offset="9230608">That was proved to a qualified extent by the handwriting expert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.091" offset="9259760">So, we urged that giving exemplars as in the case at bar involves no violation of the privilege against self-incrimination, a privilege which invokes the right to the assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.046" offset="9319528">We'd like to say a few words about the search and seizure point by way of factual background, just after the shooting of Officer Davis at the Mutual Savings and Loan, a businessman in the area saw two men running out of the Savings and Loan and then shortly saw a car drive away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.330" offset="9420675">Now, this man told Officer Nixon that the persons -- two persons were in a white Pontiac and gave Nixon the license number on a slip of paper, Nixon broadcasts this information over his police radio then went in pursuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.432" offset="9477099">Soon afterward, another person told Nixon that two men had left a white Pontiac and driven away an Oldsmobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.996" offset="9507401">Soon after, Nixon came upon a white Pontiac that was parked and the license number tallied with that on the slip of paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.693" offset="9542196">And then soon afterward, he saw a Chevrolet automobile in which contained Mr. Weaver who as it developed was mortally wounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.005" offset="9595382">Well, Weaver was taken to the hospital, interviewed by FBI Agent Norton.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.407" offset="9620982">After -- and Norton kept in contact with his office relative to the information that Weaver was giving which information lead the authorities to this apartment for the Hawaiian sounding name near Los Feliz and Riverside Drive and the pursuit was so hot that Gilbert or Mr. Flood as he was known at the apartment was apparently just leaving as the FBI Agent Kiel arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.907" offset="9755042">Other officers arrives shortly including Agent Schlatter, where we have testimony in the records set out in our brief as to Schlatter's frame of mind when he entered the apartment with a key.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.400" offset="9820975">It was his frame of mind that the authorities had information that there were three robbers, that one was wounded and accounted for, that would be Weaver, one had left a few minutes earlier, and a third was unaccounted for and might very well be in that apartment right then and there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.221" offset="9888266">And of course, Mr. Schlatter was aware that a police officer had been shot, and he explained in his testimony the authorities were going into a place where there is a man who had just participated in a bank robbery and might be armed, and it was their intention to take that man into custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.048" offset="9963604">So we urged that the exigent circumstances of the robbers fleeing in a hot pursuit justified the entry into the apartment by means of the key unannounced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.763" offset="10002474">Now, once they were inside, the authorities observed some objects in open view and -- or the -- with the exception of some photographs, these were taken later on in connection with the issuance of search warrants.</text>

            <text syncTime="3463.553" offset="13957622">King was only involved in the robbery involving Mutual Savings of Alhambra, and so it -- wasn't involved in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.538" offset="13985520">It is our position that this case does not bring -- present an occasion where this Court might want to reexamine the holding that it made in Delli Paoli.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.213" offset="14028257">We think that the circumstances here quite clearly point out that the jury in this case was able to follow the limiting instructions and we want to emphasize the fact that these limiting instructions were very precise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.834" offset="14082696">They were given, not at only at the end of the case, but the admonitions were given to the jury at the very time the statements were being introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.702" offset="14114147">I think the five factors, which this Court found very important, Delli Paoli apply here, and that this is even a stronger case than Delli Paoli.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.613" offset="14153853">There are certain considerations that we should note here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.340" offset="14164720">In this case, the two defendants were represented by separate attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.077" offset="14183633">In fact that there was a separability as to them was made evident to them through out the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.263" offset="14208397">The defendants were represented as they say by separate counsel and there was no motion needed, pretrial or during the trial for a separate trial and we think this is significant as the case developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.291" offset="14268583">It is also to be noted that the co-defendant King took the stand and on examination on the stand acknowledged that his statements were motivated by desire, to place the (Inaudible) Gilbert, and to point the finger of guilt at him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.186" offset="14332113">And the district attorney didn't rely on this statement as to Gilbert, in fact he was discounting the statements of King and discounting particularly that part of it which would indicate that there was compulsion on the part of King because of Gilbert's actions and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.279" offset="14404524">But we think that these are all significant factors which would show that there was no unfairness in the introduction into this joint trial of the statements of a co-defendant with these very clear and explicit limiting instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.430" offset="14465128">Now, Mr. Sokolow has briefly touched upon the circumstances of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.108" offset="14487803">The statement of King to the authorities was that he and the co-defendant, Weaver, the co-robber I should say, Weaver who was killed in this robbery had met at a parole meeting and thereafter, they had discussed the stealing of the car by King for certain purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.884" offset="14562931">And it was agreed on the morning of January the 3rd 1964 that King would steal a car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.765" offset="14586441">He stole one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.532" offset="14589471">He met Weaver and Gilbert.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.731" offset="14598248">Drove with them up through Alhambra and awaited for them out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.890" offset="14610892">His statement to the officer was they returned -- Weaver was bleeding profusely and King -- Gilbert, according to King's statement, put a gun up to his stomach and told me, he'd better do what he told him to do, and that he had just killed a cop and he'd probably kill more that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.035" offset="14683512">And King went with Gilbert to Gilbert's apartment where apparently Gilbert made another attempt on his life according to King's statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.235" offset="14720293">But thereafter, King admitted that Gilbert gave him $1300 and King drove Gilbert to a place where he met someone and King left.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.274" offset="14756446">Now this was a purport of King's statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.490" offset="14769298">Now, King took the stand and testified insofar as it was immaterial to the charges, the same as his statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.333" offset="14800750">He omitted in his testimony the reference to the statements supposedly made by Gilbert that he just shot a cop and that he would kill more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.497" offset="14837321">Now, we submit that under the circumstances of this case, when the statement was introduced with limiting instructions and I think it is significant at this time to note that at the penalty phase of a trial, these statements were not reintroduced and that there was no testimony by King at the penalty phase and the district attorney made no comment on the statements of the defendant King.</text>

            <text syncTime="3772.896" offset="15194990">And this is what the jury heard in determining the penalty and we don't understand this case as being a challenge to the constitutionality of Penal Code Section 190.1.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.518" offset="15241488">And we submit that there was no unfairness in the penalty trial where a guilt or innocence of the defendant Gilbert having already been determined and that -- at the guilt trial, there was obviously no prejudice because there were limiting instructions and I think there were five factors in Delli Paoli which this Court dealt with very significant which we feel exist in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.557" offset="15345560">My first note as I'd already indicated that the judge in this case wasn't content with just merely giving an instruction at the end of the case, telling the jury that the statements of a co-defendant made in -- not in the presence of the other defendant wasn't binding on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.794" offset="15406582">At the very time the statement was made and this was at the close of the People's case in chief, the counsel then representing Gilbert, when a question was asked of Officer Bennett concerning King's statements, said I will object to the question Your Honor as to the defendant Gilbert on the ground that it is hearsay as to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3844.685" offset="15482128">And the district attorney then said, the objection is well taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.656" offset="15494040">And the Court said, obviously, it wouldn't apply to the defendant Gilbert and whatever is said here, you are to draw absolutely no connection with the defendant Gilbert and disregarded insofar as the defendant Gilbert is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.042" offset="15543568">Now, thereafter, counsel representing Gilbert made a motion that the references to Gilbert be deleted in this statement and the Court heard this and determined that it wouldn't be feasible to delete these references by name to Gilbert and of -- obviously of course at that time, at the end of the People's case, with all this eyewitness identification, the identity of the particular person namely Gilbert was clear and the Court felt that it would not be fair for the declarant to delete it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.525" offset="15661432">However, it continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3891.378" offset="15668851">I think however at this time in view of the testimony of this witness, which she has not completed as yet that I should inform you that this testimony is not binding on the defendant Gilbert in anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.768" offset="15710438">It is completely hearsay as far as he is concerned, you are not to draw any inferences whatever from the testimony you've heard from this witness as to anything in connection with the defendant Gilbert.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.700" offset="15750144">I will warn you again about this, but I thought it would only be fair that I give you this admonition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3916.343" offset="15768743">And the Court continued to warn constantly during the introduction of the statements and it concluded with the instruction given both at the guilt phase and at the penalty phase, that they were not to consider the statements of the co-defendant made outside of the presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.517" offset="15833422">Now, we submit that this was a very significant factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.672" offset="15858082">We would urge that in Delli Paoli, this Court found that the fact that -- in that case the conspiracy was a simple one was -- and therefore the instruction would be easy for the jury to understand was an important factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.518" offset="15909491">We submit that the case, the issues here was simple and that the severability as to the two defendants was significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.463" offset="15941256">Gilbert was the one who entered the Savings and Loan, shot the police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.922" offset="15959019">King's position was merely the driver of the get-away car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3967.773" offset="15974484">We also note that there were separate attorneys and we've also mentioned there was no request at anytime for a separate trial as to these two defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.482" offset="16009279">Now, the introduction of the statement of King was postponed to the end of the Government's case and this Court felt that that was significant in Delli Paoli because it made the instructions in the admonitions easier for the jury to understand and to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.923" offset="16067062">And the statement of the co-defendant in Delli Paoli merely corroborated what was already in the Governor's -- Government's case and we submit that at this stage, the jury obviously knew that Gilbert was the man who perpetrated the robbery for all the mass of eyewitness identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.204" offset="16136234">And they had the confrontation in Gilbert which they didn't have in Delli Paoli as I recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.510" offset="16157445">And I think the fifth factor which is most important is that there was nothing in the record to show that the jury was unable to understand the admonition and the instruction of the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4024.191" offset="16200182">And we think this is significant here, what is probably more significant is there is nothing in the record to show that they did not follow the admonition and the instruction of the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4034.052" offset="16239574">And I think the reference to Jackson versus Denno which counsel made is inappropriate because their witness, the Court was dealing with an involuntary confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.132" offset="16275937">It didn't have an involuntary confession here, you had a confession that was voluntarily made by the co-defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.372" offset="16300910">And we submit that in -- under such a circumstance, that the rationale of this Court in Jackson wasn't applicable and what this Court said in the very recent case of Spencer versus Texas, I think it's quite appropriate where an effort was made to say that a jury could not understand it clear and explicit instruction to -- in Spencer, limit its application as to testimony concerning the defendant's prior felony convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.974" offset="16407280">And this Court said, it would be extravagant in the extreme to take Jackson as it -- evidencing a general distrust on the part of this Court, of the ability of juries to approach their test responsibly and to sort out issues given to them under proper instructions by the judge in the criminal case or standing for the proposition that limiting instructions can never purge the erroneous introduction of evidence or limit the evidence to its rightful purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.424" offset="16513024">We submit that the instructions in this case and the admonitions in this case certainly could lead the jury to limit the application of the statements of the co-defendant King and that there was no prejudice.</text>

            <text syncTime="4488.953" offset="18059160">But first, let me say that on this question of Delli Paoli or Jackson versus Denno, we must bear in mind that we have the same jury adjudicating both the question of depth and the question of the merits, that is guilt or innocence, and all they did was take -- I think a week in before they started on the other matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4503.608" offset="18117778">In other words, when the verdict came in, I think it was perhaps a day or so, and then they immediately began to deliberate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4508.902" offset="18138990">And I think its mere folly to assume that after weeks and weeks and weeks of trial that they're suddenly going to forget all the evidence they've heard.</text>

            <text syncTime="4622.747" offset="18594356">But, the death penalty question in California, there's no reasonable doubt standard even.</text>
            <text syncTime="4627.085" offset="18611702">It's thrown entirely in the lap of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4628.945" offset="18619120">There is no way to determine now what factors influenced them and what factors didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="4633.199" offset="18636152">And in this case, I would suggest, when a man's life is at stake, that one of the most crucial questions is what are the chances that's he's going to repeat this kind of conduct, how confirmed a criminal is he, are there any hope for rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4646.231" offset="18688293">And when this statement had came in, designating him as a cop killer by his own admission, and saying that he's going to kill more, and the jury couldn't forget that no matter how clearly they were told to disregard it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4657.819" offset="18734686">I would point out it would just be absolutely impossible for the jury to follow the instruction under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4663.574" offset="18757674">Furthermore, as to that particular statement, if we go back to Delli Paoli, I don't see what the admissibility is, in other words, in what way is it admissible against King because he's -- recites the fact that Gilbert said that he'd killed one policeman and he's going to kill someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="4678.263" offset="18816397">I suggest, this is merely the backdoor technique that by use of the -- what would ordinarily be admissions against King of bringing in something which doesn't even qualify with that score and that it radiates over against Gilbert, and no instruction can cure it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4711.872" offset="18950875">And my commentary on this would be that the People versus Aranda rule in California did not come down until after Gilbert had been tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="4718.597" offset="18977729">And the -- that's upon other opinions by this Court and other courts have indicated that counsel can't be expected to anticipate the law -- changes in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4726.487" offset="19009285">And I would point out that -- if this Court does adopt an Aranda like rule, that the Government should be charged with letting the opposition know, if they have these kind of statements and they're going to introduce them, because after all, it's the Government that brings the joint trial rather than two separate trials because the Government knows this facts and knows whether they need these statements and whether they are going to be introduced.</text>
