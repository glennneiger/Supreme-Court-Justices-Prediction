            <text syncTime="34.304" offset="240619">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.570" offset="261622">I'm appearing on behalf of the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission and I am sharing the argument with Mr. Sigmon who is counsel for the Motor Carrier Associations in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.791" offset="318568">These are consolidated appeals from that part of judgment of a three-judge court in the Northern District of Illinois which held unlawful two rules prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission with respect to trailer-on-flatcar service, often referred to as piggyback.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.630" offset="405922">The rules involved are printed at pages 74 up to 75 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.585" offset="437687">Rule 1, in effect, defines TOFC service or piggyback as the transportation of truck trailers and railroad flatcars.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.427" offset="489096">Rules 2 and 3 are the rules which were declared unlawful by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.544" offset="513546">Rule 2 entitled available -- availability to all TOFC service provides that TOFC service, if offered by a rail carrier through it's open-tariff publications, shall be made available to any person at a charge no greater and no less than that receives of any person or persons were doing for him or them, a like and contemporaneous service for the transportation of a like kind of traffic under similar circumstances and conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.632" offset="641860">The second rule, Rule 3 provides and accepts as otherwise prohibited by these rules motor common and contract carriers, water common and contract carriers, and freight forwarders may use TOFC service for all or any part of their authorized service.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.883" offset="734856">For convenience, all the parties argued this case as though it involves only the utilization of real piggyback services by motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.474" offset="785220">Thus, in our brief, we stated the questions as to whether Commission acted within its authority in ruling that railroads which offered piggyback services to the shipping public must offer it on the same terms to motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.713" offset="858258">And secondly, that subject to a certain restrictions, motor carriers are entitled to use rail piggyback service in the performance of their own authorized services.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.011" offset="927431">For a brief background as a generality, large quantities of freight can be moved for long distances, most cheaply by rail.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.256" offset="972361">However, for the many shippers and consignees not located on rail tracks, traditional rail transportation has limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.710" offset="1010186">It involves loading the freight on a truck, transfer it to the railhead, unloading into a railroad car and the reverse procedure at the other end of the rail movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.936" offset="1063163">The characteristic flexibility of the motor carrier is the ability to pick up freight at a shipper's door and transfer it in a single movement to the door of a consignee.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.854" offset="1118751">And so during recent years, both for hire motor carriers and private motor carriers, that is shippers owning their own motor vehicles, came to comprise a large and growing segment of intercity transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.771" offset="1194506">TOFC service or piggyback combines the flexible door-to-door service of the motor carrier, motor vehicle with the line haul efficiency of the railroad or stated in a recently published study by the Commission of Bureau of Economics, piggyback combines the advantages of movement by truck with the long haul economies of rail under conditions which hold total expense to a minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.353" offset="1316760">Now, no one suggest that piggyback is always more efficient than all rail or all motor transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.111" offset="1351868">But no party in this case disputes, however, that this is so for many movements involving relatively long hauls.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.190" offset="1400142">Piggyback service has had a dramatic development from a mere trickle in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.367" offset="1432848">By 1965, the railroads had moved -- were moving in that year 1,430,000 trailers in piggyback service.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.940" offset="1471091">And that produced rail gross revenues of $384 million or 4.3% of total rail gross revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.599" offset="1517798">TOFC or piggyback service has been performed -- is being performed under five basic arrangements which are in popular industry usage called Plans I, II, III, IV, and V.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.232" offset="1596270">Under Plan I, the shipper's property is carried in a motor carrier's trailer at motor carrier rates and on the motor carrier's bill of lading with the motor carrier making an arrangement with the railroad to substitute rail movement, piggyback rail movement for part of the long -- all are part of the long haul trip.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.355" offset="1708805">Plan -- under Plan II, the railroad offers its own trailers to shippers for a door-to-door service using piggyback for the line haul movement.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert W. Ginnane</label>
            <text syncTime="436.320" offset="1848613">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.631" offset="1857912">Under Plan III, the railroad offers to -- to haul trailers owned by other persons, say shippers or freight forwarders from railhead to railhead at a flat charge without pick up or delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.256" offset="1928443">Under Plan IV, the shipper furnishes both the trailer and the flatcar with the -- with the railroad providing only motor power and rails.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.348" offset="1976717">Plan V is the classical joint arrangement, joint rate arrangement between a railroad and the motor carrier for a through service which the -- the then joint rate is negotiated between the railroad and the motor carrier and embodied in their official tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.016" offset="2063444">The property moves on a rail or motor bill of lading depending upon whether the railroad or the motor carrier originates the shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.064" offset="2107643">To show the relative use made at the plans, in 1965, 23% moved -- and 23% of the trailers move in Plan I, 42% in Plan II, the all-rail -- the all-rail method, 26% in Plan III, 5% in Plan IV, and 4% in Plan V, the joint rail motor.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.234" offset="2224358">You'll see that Plans I and V are bimodal plans involving a coordination of rail and motor carrier services.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.181" offset="2264064">Plan II is essentially an all-rail plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.401" offset="2280991">And Plans III and IV are the open-tariff plans and that they are not inter-carrier arrangements but are published operate in tariffs to the shipping public, to shippers and freight forwarders.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.335" offset="2336684">The net competitive result of piggybacking is this, traditionally, only motor carriers could provide a flexible door-to-door service.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.605" offset="2377749">However, as the Commission pointed out in this case, all three, rail carrier, motor carrier and freight forwarder today provide through the use of piggyback services which in physical characteristics are substantially identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.006" offset="2443368">Anyone of the three can offer a transportation service which the door-to-door pickup is by -- is by motor vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.430" offset="2485060">The freight is on a trailer and the trailer is moved for line haul in TOFC, rail TOFC or piggyback service.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.148" offset="2523930">But a crucial fact is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.887" offset="2534902">Railroads can provide shippers with a complete door-to-door piggyback service without utilizing independent motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.112" offset="2575862">Motor carriers cannot provide such a service without using the facilities of a railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.173" offset="2612015">The TOFC rules here involved resulted from the Commission's biggest investigation of piggybacking.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.048" offset="2643571">An investigation and rulemaking -- an investigation and rulemaking procedure which began in June 1962, and I think it's fair to say to state that three factors led to the institution of this procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.092" offset="2703757">The Commission had stated before in 1939 and in 1954 that it was repugnant to the Act, the motor carrier to Act as a common carrier by motor vehicle and as a shipper by railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.307" offset="2772616">And that was widely interpreted to mean that a motor carrier could not utilize these open-tariff piggyback tariffs of the railroads such as Plans III and IV.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.236" offset="2820368">That meant that the rail motor coordinated service was being forced in the Plans I and V which are voluntary arrangements and in which the roads may refused to join, and some have.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.028" offset="2879509">Secondly, the whole major development of piggybacking has taken place since 1954 when the Commission last looked at the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.091" offset="2919737">And third, in April 1962, President Kennedy had recommended that Congress enact a legislation to ensure all carriers the right to ship on the carriers of other branches of the transportation industry at the same rates available to non-carrier shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.353" offset="2996746">So it seemed clear to the Commission that that time was right for a fresh look.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.503" offset="3013360">Now, on a more current record and more detailed record, the Commission's notice a rulemaking announced that the proceeding would embrace every aspect of piggybacking including the extent of which motor carriers, water carriers, should be permitted to use Plans III and IV, the open-tariff rail rates and services following the receipt of written presentations on examiner's report in an oral argument before the entire showing.</text>

            <text syncTime="827.405" offset="3413034">The Commission emphasized in its report that all TOFC service is inherently bimodal and that its basic characteristic is the combination of the inherent advantages of rail and motor transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.220" offset="3468204">And the Commission stated that it is obvious to us that the inherent advantages of each mode of transportation can be given free as plates with the highest degree of coordination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1006.056" offset="4127640">So I say the Commission modeled its rule in -- partly verbatim upon the provisions of Section 2, where it provided that if a railroad offers TOFC service to shippers, it must make it available to any person at a charge no greater and no less than that received on any other persons for doing for them a like and contemporaneous service in the transportation of a like kind of traffic under substantially similar circumstances and conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.574" offset="4249684">Now, the appellees contend and the lower court held that Section 2 of the Act relates only to discrimination on rates and does not apply to a total denial of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.653" offset="4297958">They also contend that Section 3 (1) with which -- which is in pari materia to Section 2 only prohibits a carrier from discriminating between shippers and provides no protection for a carrier acting as a shipper in tendering freight to another carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.596" offset="4373713">The principal evil at which the entire Act was directed was discrimination in all its forms that this Court held in -- in New York case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.580" offset="4409657">And we contend that under this Court's decisions, when a carrier tenders a shipment of freight to another carrier for transportation, this first carrier must be treated as a patron of a second and is protected against the discrimination prohibited by Section 2 and 3 (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.079" offset="4491682">To begin with, in Wight v. United States, in 167 U.S. and in later cases, this Court reiterated that Section 2's phrase under substantially similar circumstances and conditions refers to the physical transportation of -- the principal transportation characteristics, not to various competitive considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.353" offset="4604740">At the same time other decisions made it clear that it is immaterial that the sender of the freight is a carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.313" offset="4632639">For example, on ICC v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio, in 225 U.S. this Court held that Section 2 prohibited a railroad from establishing for coal shipped by another railroad for its own use, rates lower than those applicable to coal shipped for the uses -- for other uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.188" offset="4724172">And this Court said it is not the relationship of one railroad to another with which we have any concern here, but the relation of a railroad to its patrons, in that case an -- another railroad which it could not favor just because it was a railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.155" offset="4791986">We think closely in point as this Court's decision in ICC v. Delaware and Lackawanna, in 220 U.S., in that case this Court held unlawful, the practice of some railroads of charging less than carload rates on carload shipments presented by freight forwarders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.849" offset="4898774">The rates charged that freight forwarders were substantially higher than the carload rates charged other shippers who submitted -- who presented carload shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.298" offset="4940570">And this Court said that that discrimination was improper even though the freight forwarders were competitors of the railroads, in the sense that if they were permitted to use the carload rates --</text>

            <text syncTime="1237.181" offset="5052061">These cases clearly stand for the principle that when it turn -- when a carrier tenders freight to another carrier for a transportation the first carrier is a patron of the second, as a patron, as a shipper he must be treated with equality with other shippers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1267.474" offset="5173269">We submit that this principle of equal rate treatment enunciated in such cases as the Lackawanna case applies equally to the greater discrimination involved in a complete refusal to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.919" offset="5231052">This Court recognized in the Lackawanna case that the practical economic effects of a total refusal to serve and exacting a discriminatorily high rate are precisely the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.123" offset="5283819">But even if we are wrong as to this, the same result follows from Section 3 (1) of the Act, that's in our brief at page 71 which admittedly prohibits both rate and service discriminations between shippers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1319.635" offset="5381935">It did not mention Section 3 in haec verba but at page 336 of its report, it relies upon and discusses the Louisville &amp; Nashville decision in 282 U.S. 760 which is a 3 (1) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.774" offset="5466467">In the Louisville &amp; Nashville case which the Commission relied upon, this Court held that Section 3 (1) was violated when a railroad moved private passenger and office cars owned by another railroad at lower rates than it moved such cars when owned by other persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.842" offset="5562702">This case again makes it clear that for the purpose of -- purposes of Section 3 -- 3 (1) that when a carrier tenders goods as a shipper it is entitled under Section 3 (1) to the same but only the same treatment as any other shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.864" offset="5654862">Now, the appellees contend and the court below held that motor carriers desiring to use rail piggyback service are excluded from the protection on Section 3 (1) by the proviso in Section 3 (1) which reads that this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to discrimination, prejudice or disadvantage, the traffic of any other carrier of whatever description.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.280" offset="5760502">In our brief, we demonstrate that the purpose of this proviso was to ensure that the sweeping antidiscriminatory provisions of Section 3 (1) did not apply to the rate and other practices by which a carrier seeks to divert traffic from other carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.400" offset="5844929">We point out that nothing in the purposes or history of the proviso even suggests that it was intended to authorize a railroad to refuse to accept a shipment tendered by a motor carrier on the same terms that it accepts shipments from everybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.239" offset="5924342">It briefly contend that the antidiscrimination provisions of the Act as interpreted by this Court prohibit a railroad which offers TOFC services to the shipping public from refusing to make it available upon the same terms to motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.490" offset="5997380">I should like to refer to some obvious economic implications of the Commission's Rules 2 and 3 in relation to the objectives of the National Transpiration Policy which the Commissions has commanded both by the policy itself and by the decisions of this Court to keep in mind and apply in administering and interpreting the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.821" offset="6090689">That policy states that it is hereby declared to be the National Transportation Policy to provide for a fair and impartial regulation of all modes of transportation, so administered as to recognize and preserve the inherent advantages of each to promote economical and efficient service all to the end of developing and coordinating and preserving a national transportation system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.770" offset="6202493">As to the policies objective of preserving the inherent advantages of each, the Commission pointed out, had found at page 322, that there can be no doubt of the benefit which TOFC service has already rendered the railroads in allowing them to recapture traffic loss to competing modes of transportation and especially the private carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.637" offset="6293922">Also benefiting had been the motor carriers which had been provided an opportunity through the use of Plan I of TOFC service that the railroads will concur and abuse, to obtain efficient line haul transportation for themselves, and thus, to help themselves even while their business helps the rail competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.454" offset="6393187">I wish to emphasize that the Commission's TOFC Rules 2 and 3 do not require a railroad to move a single trailer load at less than compensatory rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.377" offset="6456926">Assuming that their open-tariff rates for TOFC service are compensatory, we have not yet heard a plausible reason as to why they should not welcome the piggyback business tendered by motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.554" offset="6529546">In their various briefs, they conjure up horrible operating problems which they say would be created if they must allow motor carriers to utilize piggyback service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.578" offset="6577716">I think one of them is that they would be -- have, could have a lot of trailers dropped down on late Friday afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.647" offset="6610004">The simple answer to all that sort of conjure -- conjuncture problem is that the railroad's duty under Section 1 (4) is to provide transportation upon reasonable demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.575" offset="6665697">A motor carrier like a large shipper can get good piggyback service only by detailed planning and coordination with the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.522" offset="6717419">It would be like General Motors, at noon asking a railroad for a thousand flatcars of -- for the next morning, that sort of thing just doesn't happened in highly coordinated transportation operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.908" offset="6778964">Again, it is undisputed that piggyback TOFC is the only significant technique which has been developed for coordinated rail motor carrier service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.991" offset="6831313">The National Transportation Policy talks about it, everybody's been talking about the need for coordinated service for decades, this is the only possibility which has developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.391" offset="6876975">The Commission's rules permit and encourage motor carriers to use it whenever they find it advantageous to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.006" offset="6911352">To the extent that this happens and the rapid growth of Plan I operations in which motor carriers do permit -- can permit, can participate if the railroads agree, it will occur on a substantial scale and it will generally will reflect a more advantageous use of the nation's transportation resources including perhaps some relief of congestion on -- on our highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.004" offset="7039352">Basically, all the arguments of the railroads actually affect that the Interstate Commerce Act and the National Transportation Policy are too rigid to permit this pouring of new line into the old bottle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.250" offset="7100374">In a similar situation, they took essentially the same position and was rejected by this Court in United States v. Pennsylvania Railroad, in 323 U.S. in 1945, an opinion written by Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.264" offset="7180413">It really sounds like this, in that case the Seatrain Lines had -- had devised an economical method of carrying loaded railroad cars on specially designed ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.099" offset="7239764">The railroads refused to interchange cars to Seatrain and the Act did not specifically require them to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.926" offset="7275081">However, looking to their objectives of the National Transportation Policy, this Court sustained the Commission's order requiring the railroads to interchange cars with Seatrain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.793" offset="7322520">And hereto, we submit, that implementation of the objectives of the National Transportation Policy requires that the Commission be upheld in construing the Act as prohibiting a motor carrier from offering piggyback service to the shipping public unless it makes it available on the equal terms --</text>

            <text syncTime="1925.217" offset="7804217">The District Court and the Commission take a basically different view of trailer-on-flatcar service, and this difference of view leads to enlarged measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.638" offset="7849880">I think there are different conclusions with respect to the lawfulness of the open-tariff rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.772" offset="7882480">The District Court looked at the Interstate Commerce Act as a rigid division of service transportation in the four modes as they are regulated by the four Roman numeral parts of the Act and it spoke of each mode being confined to transportation by that mode in terms of both the -- the actual separation into four parts and in terms of the internal logic of the Act, therefore, it concluded that a motor carrier is confined to transportation by motor vehicle unless there are some special exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.439" offset="8061158">The Commission, however, as Mr. Ginnane has noted after reviewing the history of the development of piggyback or trailer-on-flatcar transportation, concluded that it is a bimodal service, it combines elements of both rail and motor transportation as the more formal name trailer-on-flatcar service that suggest two necessary elements, a trailer and a flatcar and the trailer is just as essential to the successful operation of the service as the flatcar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.568" offset="8225625">But a bimodal service won't fit into the rigid modal pattern that the District Court suggests for the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.375" offset="8264913">The District Court accepted the argument of the appellees that trailer-on-flatcar service is a rail service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.467" offset="8313292">It did not discuss and didn't specifically overturn the Commission's conclusion that it is a bimodal service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.629" offset="8357909">The appellees of course do dispute it and in their briefs they, they based their arguments on the violations with respect to Section 216 and Part IV on the theory that this is a rail service that we are dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.775" offset="8434500">The Commission was in this case dealing with a new transportation development which combines elements of the old.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.379" offset="8464906">It combines them in such a way that they cannot be separated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.275" offset="8480475">If a highway trailer is not used, trailer-on-flatcar transportation simply will not be successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.947" offset="8511195">The whole theory of developing it and its whole success in this rapid growth that Mr. Ginnane referred to has been the ability to transport a loader freight from shipper's door to consignee door in the same highway vehicle without a transfer of lading in route.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.857" offset="8614849">The District Court, however, viewing the Act as confining each carrier to transportation by its separate mode absent some exception looked to Section 216 (c) covering the through routes and joint rate arrangements for motor carriers, as the only possible exception to this rigid modal pattern which modal pattern would confine the motor carriers to operations strictly by motor vehicle.</text>

            <text syncTime="2173.233" offset="8796348">I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.675" offset="8818082">The District Court said that the Interstate Commerce Commission did not dispute the premise of the appellees' arguments below that a de facto through routes is created when a motor carrier utilizes a rail movement under an open rail tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.669" offset="8902092">Actually, an answer to that argument as it was made to the Commission, it said that what is a through route is a matter of fact and it's cited among other cases Thompson versus U.S., 343 U.S. being a question of fact what is a through a route is not subject to any general rule but depends on the particular circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.777" offset="9006477">In Thompson, this Court said that the test of a through route is whether the participating carriers hold themselves out as offering a through transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.970" offset="9063215">The District Court compared the, what it called, the operative features of the Plan I which everybody with one possible exception on the side, the appellees concedes is a valid through route-joint rate arrangements between a railroad and a motor carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.875" offset="9134895">And the motor carrier participation in trailer-on-flatcar service under the Commission's proposed open-tariff rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.494" offset="9165302">It concluded -- the only difference is the consent of the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.299" offset="9188603">And if the consent is lacking, I think all parties agree the 216 (c) would preclude the through route arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.955" offset="9255163">But the test of a through route as the Court said in Thompson is whether the carriers hold themselves out to perform a through service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.677" offset="9294033">When a motor carrier under its own billing secures a trailer load of freight takes it to a railroad raft and under a railroad tariff holding out a ramp-to-ramp Plan III service offers that trailer to the railroad, picks it up at the terminal ramp of the rail run, carries it onto the ultimate customer and delivers it, the railroad and the motor carrier are not holding out a through service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.437" offset="9441155">The railroad tariff covers only the rail movement between the ramps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.432" offset="9477099">The rail bill of lading is with the motor carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.006" offset="9495385">The rail has no contract with the shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.801" offset="9510536">The railroad rate for this rail portion of the service is determined by itself, the rules and regulations which cover the applicability of the service are set by the railroad in a -- through route arrangement under a Plan I operation or a conventional Plan V operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.132" offset="9607920">The participating carriers joining together and holding out the through route joined together and determine the rate that is to be applied on the through transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.878" offset="9654836">The bill of lading which the shipper covers the entire shipment and both the rail and the motor carrier are obligated to the shipper for the proper performance of the entire transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.664" offset="9722023">The differences in the obligations and liabilities are set at in our brief, the -- essentially the -- under a through route arrangement, be the railroad or motor carrier is liable to the shipper for the proper completion of the trip and for any loss or damage that may occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.615" offset="9813870">Now, the motor carrier is the only one who contracts with the shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.971" offset="9831215">The railroad's contract is exclusively with motor carrier and only for the rail portion of the trailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.679" offset="9854098">The railroad is not liable to the shipper for this removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.482" offset="9881266">The District Court assumed that there is a de facto through route created and dealt with the question of compulsion and as I said, if there is a through route created, then it cannot be compelled under Section 216 (c) because through routes and joint rates between motor carrier of property or between motor carriers of property and railroads are permissive under 216 (c), but when there is no through route involved, there is no compulsion on the railroad entering a through route.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.556" offset="10037582">The only compulsion that there is and this is the compulsion mentioned in the Commission's Report is to hold out its service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.674" offset="10078020">The Commission said there's no compulsion on the railroad either to provide this trailer-on-flatcar service or on the motor carrier to make use of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.751" offset="10126399">The only compulsion there is on the railroad where it holds out its service to the public in an open-tariff to serve the public without discrimination, without attempting to select among the shippers that it will serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.889" offset="10190973">The other aspect of the District Court case which deals with a direct conflict between the open-tariff rules and provisions of the Act are those really in Part IV of the Act relating to the regulation of freight forwarders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.119" offset="10271848">Now, the District Court in its decision only considered the extreme case, it spoke of a carrier who performed only an assembly in distribution service and use another carrier to perform the entire transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.889" offset="10346977">It spoke of a carrier who's -- who's only tied with the motor carrier operation with an unexercised certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.789" offset="10394520">But the Commission specifically said that where a motor carrier holds out to perform only this, an assembly in distribution service and uses an underlying transportation company between points that it itself cannot serve in a practicable manner, then no doubt in the Commission's own line, it would be acting a forwarder and not as a carrier itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.500" offset="10497337">There is a specific section of the Commission's Report which was not discussed in the District Court opinion which dealt with the question of the abandonment of service by motor carriers at authorized points through the use of trailer-on-flatcar transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.559" offset="10593573">A rule had been suggested which would have set requirements for actual operations over the highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.305" offset="10632547">The Commission considered the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.601" offset="10649788">It noted its power under Section 204 (a) (1) of the Act to regulate motor carriers and to that end to establish reasonable requirements with respect to continuous and adequate service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.971" offset="10711228">It noted in fact that every certificate of public convenience and necessity issued to a motor carrier by it carries forward this requirement as to the performance of a reasonably continuous and adequate service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.134" offset="10771937">Based on it's consideration of it's power under the Act and under the condition that they have put in the certificate, the Commission found it unnecessary to prescribe an additional rule relating to the motor carrier performance of an adequate service over the highway where it were -- was also using the trailer-on-flatcar service between the points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.334" offset="10880711">It clearly, in that discussion showed that it would not permit a motor carrier to operate as the -- in the Court's example and the only example the Court used that is to pre -- stop carrying itself on the highway and only perform an assembly in distribution service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.414" offset="11005053">Under Sections 402 (a) (5) of the Act, a freight forwarder is defined as a person who otherwise and as a carrier subject to Part I, Part II or Part III holds out to transport or to provide transportation in a certain manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.053" offset="11111633">Part I, Part II, and Part III of course are the three parts that covered the -- the physical modes of carriage, railroads, motor carriers and water carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.713" offset="11166177">That language had parenthetical exclusory language otherwise than as a carrier subject to Part I, II or III, is recognition by Congress that there are operational similarities between what freight forwarders do and -- in our example that we are using, what motor carriers do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.268" offset="11248410">And it is a recognition that Congress did not intend to carve out a -- an exclusive area of operation for the freight forwarder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.891" offset="11310895">These operational similarities, motor carriers for years have assembled small shipments into volume shipments or trailer load shipments for movement and perform distribution service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.303" offset="11372544">As long as a motor carrier is acting as a motor carrier and holds out the motor carrier service over the highway, we submit that the definition of the freight forwarder and particularly noting the exclusory language does not say that a motor carrier becomes a forwarder simply because it may use trailer-on-flatcar service in the performance of some of its authorized service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.409" offset="11512978">I must again mention some of the horrible examples of what might happen where these rules adopted that the appellees have included in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.909" offset="11570970">Most of these examples have been referred to and -- and primarily they are directed to either the question of aggravating an imbalance of operation for the railroad or pushing off on to the railroad undesirable or traffic -- or traffic which is difficult to handle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.212" offset="11668250">The thing is that this happens right today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.132" offset="11675878">This is one of the -- the necessary incidence of performing a transportation service that all transportation agencies deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.788" offset="11714539">We all have imbalances of operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.320" offset="11732616">We all have the balloon freight or the -- the oversized freight that we have to handle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.179" offset="11768038">As to the railroad's open-tariff, trailer-on-flatcar service, today a private carrier, a shipper as Mr. Ginnane explain who uses his own motor vehicle to transport his freight, he can decide that he does not want to send his drivers out on the weekend and he would rather take a group of his trailers which normally he would send over the highway with his own equipment taking down to the railroad station and put them on the railroad and let the railroad carry it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.525" offset="11921429">Obviously, all private carriers are -- are reasonable and intelligent businessmen, the difficult to handle freights, the freight which is more expensive to carry, they will if possible shipped by a for hire carrier and they will tend to utilize themselves, their own equipment in as much as possible a balanced economical operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.811" offset="12062595">And of course freight forwarders and shippers associations, shippers associations operating in much the same manner as freight forwarders but under partial exemptions from economic regulations, they have a choice of the carriers they may use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.493" offset="12137305">They may decide because of weather conditions, I think it was one of the examples suggested that they will take a majority of their trailers that are ready to move to the railroad instead of shipping them by some other means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.480" offset="12221315">All of these happens today and of course, as Mr. Ginnane said we view the problems whether they are caused by motor carriers making use of the trailer-on-flatcar service or as they exist already in the railroad operations, with a consideration of reasonableness, no favored shipper of a railroad is going to be able to come down Friday afternoon with an additional hundred trailers and get them moved out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.487" offset="12381288">If the carrier does not have the facilities available, it calls for planning, it calls for cooperation, it calls for advance notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.720" offset="12430294">Mr. Ginnane mentioned the compensatory rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.227" offset="12452237">The Commission in its report at page 329 points out that a number of the people who had supported the open-tariff trailer-on-flatcar rules had asked why should a railroad object to receiving additional business, that question still hasn't been answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.530" offset="12545442">And assuming that the railroad rates for this service are compensatory and this is a minimum requirement for lawfulness of rate is that it be compensatory, additional business should mean additional profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.292" offset="12616495">If the rates are too low, they attract this traffic now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.459" offset="12653171">No shipper is going to remain loyal indefinitely to a motor transportation if it can secure a comparable service at a lower cost from another mode and we are dealing here with comparable services.</text>

            <text syncTime="3409.554" offset="13741537">Now, the motor carrier who historically was the carrier who had the inherent advantage of the flexibility of providing a door-to-door service is meant with competition in the provision of a substantially similar service by railroads and by freight forwarders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.499" offset="13817396">What this meant was more than this because while the railroads and the freight forwarders can utilize this new bimodal transportation service, the motor carrier may make use of it because of past Commission decisions only at the sufferance of the railroads, only under the permissive through route and through rate arrangements of Section 216 (c) where he has to get the railroad's consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.722" offset="13958248">The Commission here recognized the bimodality of the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.637" offset="13981968">It recognized that all carriers should be equally allowed to participate in it without restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.896" offset="14034944">If the District Court position on the -- the sharp modal separation in the Act is actually followed through and the rules as it said must stand or fall despite of altered circumstances in the transportation industry that the logic of that modal division should preclude railroads from making use of trailer-on-flatcar service because if the motor carrier is not providing transportation by motor vehicle when it participates in trailer-on-flatcar service, the railroad is not providing transportation by train when it makes use of a service, the key element of which is a highway vehicle which it moves over the highway and is utilized to provide a door to door movement without transfer of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.436" offset="14281122">Unfortunately, from the motor carrier point of view, in 1954 in the trailer, then what is called the New Haven case in 293 ICC, the Commission considered the question of -- a number of questions relating to trailer-on-flatcar service, it did not have a record, it made its decision on a basis of questions that were presented, in briefs, and in oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.866" offset="14414869">Without a record before, the Commission held that a railroad may utilize trailer-on-flatcar service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.860" offset="14450813">And the railroads have exploited that use of that -- this bimodal transportation service to divert a substantial quantity of rate for the motor carriers as the Commission's Report shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.123" offset="14507865">What the Commission has attempted to do in this case ultimately comes down to restoring the competitive balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.743" offset="14550392">The railroads have had an opportunity to make use of trailer-on-flatcar service, the inherent advantage of the motor carrier for years to divert traffic from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.906" offset="14598980">The railroads have been able to limit or actually preclude motor carrier use of this bimodal service.</text>
