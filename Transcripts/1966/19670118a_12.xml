            <text syncTime="73.451" offset="397145">And in our submission, the excise tax is invalid whatever maybe the disposition of Kahriger and Lewis in the occupational tax because of our reading in Kahriger and Lewis is turning on the fact that the occupational tax looks to future Acts while the excise tax unequivocally looks to the past.</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="123.642" stopTime="523.777">
            <label>Mr. Charles Alan Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="123.642" offset="597974">Whereas it -- it had been raised below.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.799" offset="602572">I assure you sir that we would be attacking it also.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.782" offset="622529">We think that the perspective nature of the occupational tax was the basis of Kahriger but I understand Mr. Beytagh arguing for the United States a few moments ago, to say that the United States does not rest on that as a justification of Kahriger-Lewis cases and he puts the argument now as -- as an understanding on the thought which is voiced primarily in Lewis case of the voluntary nature of the testimony which is required that since the person may get out of the gambling business.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.520" offset="781458">He is under no compulsion to gamble, therefore under no compulsion to pay tax on gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.963" offset="803192">Now, this line of argument of course, would apply as much to the excise tax as it does to the occupational tax and I've -- we'll get back and -- and comment on that in a moment but at the outset, I would like to address myself to a question which the Chief Justice put yesterday afternoon to Mr. Zeldes in which he inquired about a hypothetical federal tax on bucket shops whether that would raise the same problems as are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.666" offset="926072">It seems to me that the Chief Justice's question was susceptible of two readings.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.006" offset="947388">If the tax, the Chief Justice had in mind was a tax specifically on the occupation of running a bucket shop then my answer would be the same as Mr. Zeldes gave.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.041" offset="991587">I would find it quiet indistinguishable from the taxes we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.366" offset="1004857">But I think that perhaps what the Chief Justice had in mind was a different kind of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.177" offset="1024084">A Federal Tax, let us say, when every person engaged in the securities business and someone so engaged refuses to pay up because he is in fact running a bucket shop and the form saying that he is in the securities business might be a link in the chain of evidence that would convict him.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.070" offset="1103600">I think that the -- if -- if that is the question the Chief Justice intended, it raises extremely important and interesting problems as to the basic theory of the privilege against self-incrimination and specifically, what kinds of compelled testimony are incriminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.046" offset="1187506">Now, the test announced by this Court in the Hoffman case and that quoted many times since has been linked in a chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.840" offset="1218748">But I'm perfectly confident, but the courts never supposed that an important and settled constitutional principle can be expressed in a forcible phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.224" offset="1272247">If one goes back to Hoffman itself, though the link in the chain language is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.606" offset="1293772">The Court also speaks of working to the implications of the question, the setting in which it is asked, the background and the peculiarities of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.441" offset="1333164">I cannot believe that the Fifth Amendment extends protection to any statement which might be admissible in evidence in a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.225" offset="1392306">I think that, if link in the chain is given with that broad a reading that there is the same difficulty that Professor Henry had observed of the outcome determined of test to guarantee trust that there is no logical stopping place.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.931" offset="1455104">There is virtually nothing that a person could not refuse to answer on the ground that it is incriminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.376" offset="1484884">I'm personally aware of the case in the Utah state court, some five years ago in which a person claimed the privilege when he was asked whether he was plaintiff with Erwin N. Griswold.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.516" offset="1525426">And my mind boggles that the notion could be possibly be incriminating to be acquainted with Griswold.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.770" offset="1550503">And I think that here the key is, to look as Hoffman says and I think Albertson now develops the theory further to look at the point at which the inquiry is made, the circumstances in which it is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.884" offset="1618944">I think that this is the reason why the government concedes that the Sullivan case does not control here.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.660" offset="1649977">It is true that one reporting income tax conceivably could report something which would be admissible in evidence in a later case.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.231" offset="1684250">Income tax returns have come in and in some kinds of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.310" offset="1700655">But as we said in -- in Albertson, the questions are neutral in there face and they're directed to the public at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.574" offset="1725628">The risk of incrimination is here a minimal risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.506" offset="1741406">We go to the other extreme, you have a person who has been subpoenaed to appear before some investigative body and here a question which addressed to the world generally might be neutral and non-incriminating because of the setting takes on a much more sinister cast.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.355" offset="1812773">And in my submission, what the Fifth Amendment really protects is against a person being compelled to give any testimony which will have a substantial effect of accusing himself of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.167" offset="1872018">Now on that analysis, I return to the bucket shop case which provoked it.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.851" offset="1898768">If the Federal Tax in question whereas I understood the Chief Justice to suggest a general tax then I would say that there would not be a constitutional privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.116" offset="1935862">That the likelihood of incrimination and asking people to say that I am engaged in the securities business is very small and that even for the bucket shop operator, this would be such a very small part of the case against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.180" offset="1996048">The government's case would require much more than that and this I think would really be insignificant.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.414" offset="2021021">I deal in the same way with the example that the United States puts in its brief, can a person refuse to pay real estate taxes because of the property which he owns is being used for purposes of prostitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.997" offset="2091342">And as the government points out, if you have a person who is himself being charged with prostitution and he's asked, “Do you own this property?” Then you have I think a very substantial link in the chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.426" offset="2141080">But if you simply ask the whole world to come forward and pay real estate taxes on the property they own, I think that you come again on the language of Albertson, the requirement is neutral on its face and directed at the public at large.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="523.777" stopTime="731.354">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="523.777" offset="2198444">Well Professor Wright, do you properly concede the purpose of my question and the reason I asked the question was because Mr. Zeldes had said this case is no different from a statute that would require burglars to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.959" offset="2279215">And I wanted to differentiate between a burglary statute and one of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.892" offset="2306905">Now it seems to me that the difference between the two is this, that -- and nobody recognizes burglary as being lawful under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.430" offset="2369076">On the other hand, gambling can be legal or it can be illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.254" offset="2396348">In some states, gambling is legal and in some states -- one state at least, practically all gambling is legal but others permit the bingo game and other things that the -- that the start -- start in small campus but eventually developed into a very big gambling industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.287" offset="2492479">Some gambling, the United States is interested in because it engages in commerce and as to that has a vital interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.369" offset="2544828">So taking it by and large, it seems to me that gambling is one of those -- one of those industries that can be legal or can be illegal but its been recognized as a kind of business that where it is made legal even, it can be regulated to the extent of extinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.625" offset="2645870">And I think that has been recognized in the law for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.486" offset="2669275">Now, if that is true and if it can be recognized that the government has great difficulty in collecting taxes from ordinary taxes from the gambling interest because of the surreptitious ways and the way they do business.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.869" offset="2754853">Is there any reason why the government cannot have special statutes directed to an industry of that kind?</text>
            <text syncTime="674.404" offset="2801037">It seems to me that's a very much the same as the securities business.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.382" offset="2824861">For instance, there are some people who don't deal in anything legal when they sell security.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.545" offset="2853595">They just set up a bucket shop and a -- and a teleformic way of doing business and operate for a while and get out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.351" offset="2896750">There are others of course, that are fairly legal and some people who normally are legal cheat on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.657" offset="2929977">And I think in those circumstances, perhaps the government could be entitled to have a registration statute for -- for all security dealers and so I just ask a question if there is a similarity between that kind of an industry and the gambling industry?</text>

            <text syncTime="2038.768" offset="8258435">But that is a question which the United States is apparently deciding though this Court expressly refused to decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.238" offset="8284348">One of the assignments of error in Shields was that the note that the judge had sent back was legally erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.837" offset="8306709">The Court in expressed words refuses to come to that issue and instead chooses to reverse simply because of the fact the judge sent the note back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.391" offset="8348923">I think the Shields case perhaps maybe read as going farther than the rule which, which we have suggested to you, the rule that you must reverse unless there is a clear showing if no prejudice that the rule that we put forward here is the one which has been adopted by virtually all of the circuits except the Second Circuit and now in this case, the Third Circuit ignoring I should say, several of its earlier decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2139.606" offset="8661765">Oh, I think it would make sense to say that the government must prove criminal culpability to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt but that we may use a different standard where the question is whether or not that there's been any harm from some lateral error which took place during the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.424" offset="8745044">I did not read the brief of the Solicitor General's office as taking much issue with the propositions of law I have suggested thus far on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.418" offset="8797080">Instead, the Solicitor General seems to rely almost exclusively on the absence of timely objection by counsel to what happened and this also was the -- a ground greatly relied on by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.468" offset="8861236">In our submission, it is not a tenable ground under the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.751" offset="8882343">I do not doubt that if counsel and the defendant are sitting in the courtroom and they see the judge someone who jurored over and talked privately to the juror, that is essential of the facts of United States v. Woodner, Second Circuit decision that there is an obligation on the counsel immediately to object.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.602" offset="8957785">They know what is going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.975" offset="8963323">It can quickly be remedied to face that you can't talk to the juror without our being present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.448" offset="8989132">But here, neither petitioner nor his counsel were present when these communications took place by the time they learned of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.400" offset="9024972">The United States attorney called 45 minutes later and advised counsel of the fact, the harm was done if the judge by at that time knew what the division of the jury was, he knew and it could hardy be eradicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.174" offset="9080038">Whatever the bailiff said to the jury had been said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.610" offset="9101772">And although, the United States suggests that you could recall the jury and inquire what goes on, what went on, I think that the better perception is that of Judge Friendly, verdict of the Second Circuit in the Girsh case when he says, the last thing in the world that you should do is recall a jury when it is in the process of its deliberations and interrogate the jurors on some collateral point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.835" offset="9198738">I think that this would have been -- and far too heroic a cure for what occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.044" offset="9227577">And so, in answer to the government's argument, that there is no objection, I submit, there is no rule that requires objection under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.895" offset="9274911">It is true that Criminal Rule 51, requires objections ordinarily that Criminal Rule 51 is very clear that no objection is required if you had no opportunity to object at the time, the ruling or action of the Court took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.815" offset="9330604">And it seems -- in my submission, the government is now seeking to affirm a judgment in which there was an error that I believe be of constitutional dimension because of counsel's failure to that which no rule set down by this Court required him to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.141" offset="9415973">In fact, even if an objection were required specifically by rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.909" offset="9443035">I, I think that if the error is truly constitutional that such recent cases as Fay v. Noia and Henry v. Mississippi would require a very searching analysis of what function the objection was thought to preserve and whether there had been a deliberate bypassing on the part of petitioner himself rather than the record so far as I recall does not show whether petitioner ever learned of the telephone call from the United States Attorney to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.971" offset="9559228">But I don't think the Court need get into that here because here in my submission, trial counsel did everything that he was required to do by any rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.443" offset="9605099">And I think that the issue then is, is properly before the Court and surely cannot be disposed off on the basis, the Third Circuit suggested that since the evidence of petitioner's guilt was overwhelming, he could not have been prejudiced by anything that happened between the judge and the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.460" offset="9669256">The jury twice reported that it was deadlock, it did not find evidence of guilt overwhelming and that in our submission is a question for the jury to decide and not for an appellate court to decide for the reasons, I suggest that we submit that the case should be reversed with dismissal of the indictment on the excise tax accounts and a new trial order on the wagering tax accounts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2444.874" offset="9882833">Let me commence by pointing out the difference between this case and the previous case which the Court heard because I think there is a very relevant difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.415" offset="9932988">There are at least four federal crimes connected with the tax area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.598" offset="9961723">There is first of all, failure to register and that's not applicable in the income tax area but it is of course applicable with many excise taxes including the tax here in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.456" offset="10009161">There are three other crimes which apply I believe equally to the income tax area and virtually all Federal taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.848" offset="10042807">They are willful failure to file a return, willful failure to disclose required information on that return, and finally, a third discreet crime, willful failure to pay the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.788" offset="10106546">Now, the only question in this case is the third of those three crimes, willful failure to pay the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.800" offset="10146565">In other words, this Court need not decide in this case whether petitioner could have been convicted for willfully failing to file a 730 return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.477" offset="10201318">A copy of which is in the record that is a return that states on the top gambling excise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.962" offset="10231202">This Court need not decide whether if he had filed either that return or some other return, whether he could be convicted for a willfully failing to disclose required information on that return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.047" offset="10283551">The only question involved here, is willful failure to pay the tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="2591.659" offset="10469961">There are a large number of other statutes, many of them described in our brief in the introductory portion of our briefs in these two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.851" offset="10502771">They include for example, one -- one example is the liquor area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.368" offset="10524818">If you want to go into the distilling business, you must register.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.904" offset="10539029">All the big distillers of course register.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.624" offset="10545821">If you want to become a wholesaler of liquor, you must register.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.956" offset="10559195">And there are taxes then imposed on the distillation of liquor that raise substantial sums of money and many other federal excise taxes are administered the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.497" offset="10605380">This is not an unusual aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.508" offset="10613426">But I'm not here dealing of course, as Justice Fortas has pointed out with the registration provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.598" offset="10637772">This Court could, could hold for the petitioner in the Marchetti case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.151" offset="10663999">I don't -- I urge you not to but this Court could hold for the petitioner in the Marchetti case and yet hold that a person is not excused from paying a tax because his business is illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.470" offset="10721259">And that same question is applicable, I think, not merely to the gambling tax but to a host of other taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.744" offset="10754382">And I would like to take just a moment to point that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.800" offset="10766608">There are of course two principal Federal Taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.879" offset="10782908">There are the excise taxes and there is the income statement gift tax group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.780" offset="10802448">Now, the excise tax doesn't consist of one tax, a gambling tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.859" offset="10822823">There were until recently with an excise tax reduction over a year ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.525" offset="10837452">Hundreds of excise taxes all going to make up a single package.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.259" offset="10856364">There were excise taxes imposed on a very large number and are traditionally held then some of them dating back into the Nineteenth Century and many of them dating from at least the 1930s and early 40s and a very large number of luxury or non-essential goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.053" offset="10931597">But -- just examples would be radios, television sets, jewelry, furs, liquors, cigarettes, sporting goods, cameras, cabaret taxes, private club dues, safe deposit boxes, playing cards, bowling alleys, pool tables, the gambling tax is not at all unusual in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.553" offset="11021563">When congress considered the gambling tax, they discussed this aspect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.750" offset="11046327">And how did the legislative history reads something like this, commercialized gambling holds the unique position of being a multibillion dollar nationwide business that is remained comparatively free from taxation by either state or federal governments. This relative immunity from taxation has persisted in spite of the fact that wagering has many characteristics which make it particularly suitable as a subject for taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.369" offset="11148831">Your committee is convinced that this is inconsistent with the present need for increased revenue. This was the Korean War days.</text>

            <text syncTime="4645.450" offset="18685158">Or possibly he could file a return instead of a 730, file a return like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4650.653" offset="18705951">A 720 which says, excise tax as in general, as you can see it's close to the payment for excise taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="4663.999" offset="18759346">But to exempt him from the payment of this excise tax, what it seems to me goes substantially beyond just as simple gambling tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="4673.558" offset="18797589">Difficult I think to distinguish between that and the payment of income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.174" offset="18820054">Counsel for both petitioners here have said, “Oh, we concede our people have to pay income taxes on their gambling business.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4686.420" offset="18849102">Well, I don't really see the distinction if they're indicted for gambling in a state and somebody puts in an income tax returns as miscellaneous, $800,000 income last year and then the state introduced its evidence which tends to show that they had no other -- no gainful occupation of any kind except their connection with various bookmakers, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.353" offset="18928828">I think that that would certainly be a link in the chain and I want to read you just one sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.117" offset="18951816">One sentence out of the petitioner's brief in the Grosso case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4716.559" offset="18969579">I think it's a little bit different than, than what the counsel said on oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4719.936" offset="18983163">He said this, “It is petitioner's position that he is protected as fully by the privilege against self-incrimination when the Government seeks the information connection with collection of a tax as if the Government would seek the information by asking him the question before a grand jury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.671" offset="19042095">Can you imagine putting a gambler on the stand and saying to him, how much income did you have last year from sources other than interest, dividends, salary, annuities, pension plans, et cetera, the various items on the return?</text>
            <text syncTime="4749.562" offset="19101654">Now that, how much miscellaneous income did you have last year?</text>
            <text syncTime="4752.700" offset="19114193">He'd say, he takes the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4754.092" offset="19119731">He doesn't have to testify to that before a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4756.542" offset="19129553">I'm sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.450" offset="19133210">So that if what counsel is arguing for is that -- that the grand jury standard applies to the payment of a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="4764.096" offset="19159751">I think this is a very sweeping doctrine and one that gives me substantial cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="4871.032" offset="19587532">The same thing is true here that the result would be what the government collects the tax but to restrict to use on a jury trial point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4879.509" offset="19621386">I would say that it's quite clear what happened here after approximately one day of deliberation, the judge received a note.</text>
            <text syncTime="4888.030" offset="19655450">The record clearly shows that the note said, although the note was note reserved, the note said, “We are unable to agree what should we do?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.647" offset="19694007">Now, the judge testified to that, the judge explained that a short time later.</text>
            <text syncTime="4902.037" offset="19711561">The judge then said to the bailiff, “Tell them to continue deliberating.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4907.783" offset="19734549">The record also has the judge's statement that that's why I told the bailiff to tell them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4912.686" offset="19754088">Within 45 minutes after that communication to the jury, the defense counsel learned about the incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="4923.160" offset="19795989">He did not at that time say, let's preserve the note.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.146" offset="19808005">I'm sure the note was still in existence within 45 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4929.613" offset="19821798">He did not at that time say, let's put the bailiff understand and ask him, bring the bailiff in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4935.279" offset="19844472">Put him under oath and ask him, what did you tell the jury?</text>
            <text syncTime="4937.234" offset="19852309">He didn't suggest any of those procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="4939.532" offset="19861504">What he did is he waited, and two days later, while the jury was still deliberating.</text>
            <text syncTime="4944.648" offset="19881984">The jury deliberations having been interrupted for a day-and-a-half because of the illness of a juror but when the jury got back to deliberate and again, they send exactly the same note to the judge, said, “We are enable to agree, what should we do?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4955.128" offset="19923884">And the judge looked at and said, “This is about the same note that I got the first time substantially exactly the same.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4961.305" offset="19948544">And then he turned to the bailiff, this was in the presence of both the defendant and his counsel and he turned to the bailiff and he said, “Tell them to continue deliberating.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4969.493" offset="19981354">The same thing he told them the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4970.886" offset="19986892">The bailiff turned around and he walked out, and the defense counsel didn't say nor the defendant jump up and say, wait a minute, bring the jury in and let's do it all in an open court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4978.741" offset="20018343">He had no objection at that time neither the defendant nor his counsel to the bailiff going out and saying, telling the jury to continue deliberating.</text>
            <text syncTime="4986.211" offset="20048227">The bailiff had spent something like three-and-a-half days with this jury shepherding him from hotel, to Court, to lunch, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4994.186" offset="20080097">He had plenty of time to talk to the jury if he wanted to about this case and to prejudice their deliberations and certainly, the fact that we was told -- go in and tell them to continue deliberating, didn't give him any great opportunity to step in there and do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="5007.458" offset="20133177">Moreover, one more point, during the course of this jury deliberation which took place after approximately a six-week trial, a doctor was called to minister to one of the jurors who would become ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="5022.158" offset="20192005">The defense attorney said, “Oh, no wait a minute, what went on here?</text>
            <text syncTime="5026.525" offset="20209455">How long was this one juror was separate from the other jurors and is he in shape to testify and so forth.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5032.417" offset="20233070">And the judge at the time called in at least three people who were in contact with the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5038.116" offset="20255848">He called in his clerk, he called in the Chief Marshall, and he called in the Deputy Marshall, and they were put there and examined on what it happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5048.588" offset="20297749">Now, I submit that if the defense counsel had wanted to ask the bailiff who had been told, go tell the jury to continue deliberating.</text>
            <text syncTime="5057.636" offset="20333902">Did you tell them anything else what did you say?</text>
            <text syncTime="5059.606" offset="20341844">The bailiff was in and out of this room.</text>
            <text syncTime="5061.235" offset="20348322">The record shows that the bailiff was in and out of the room where counsel and the judge were present a number of times at least ones or twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5068.838" offset="20378728">And he could have at anytime said, put the bailiff on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="5073.646" offset="20397955">Just like you did with the clerk, the Chief Marshall, and the Deputy Chief Marshall, he didn't it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5077.732" offset="20414255">Nor did he object to the second time this incident was repeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5080.607" offset="20425749">Note followed by an oral discussion, an oral instruction to go tell the jury to continue to deliberating.</text>

            <text syncTime="5087.753" offset="20454379">He waited until the jury brought in the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="5090.204" offset="20464201">And then for the first time he said, “Where's the note?”</text>

            <text syncTime="5093.199" offset="20476217">He said, well, I don't know what happened to the note, it's five days ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.843" offset="20486771">He said, “Well, how do I know what the bailiff said?”</text>
