            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 214, the Fleischmann Distilling Corporation et al., Petitioners, versus Maier Brewing Company, et al.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.148" offset="203943">Mr. Lasky.</text>

          <turn speaker="moses_lasky" startTime="26.756" stopTime="339.870">
            <label>Mr. Moses Lasky</label>
            <text syncTime="26.756" offset="210422">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.336" offset="228707">It was nearly nine years ago that the makers and American distributors of the famous ‘Black &amp; White' whiskey sought to have the respondents discontinue an infringement of the ‘Black &amp; White' label on alcoholic beverages.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.869" offset="298820">As the District Court has said in the record, “We used every reasonable effort to obtain some reasonable accord about that without bringing a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.003" offset="339362">But we were defied.”</text>
            <text syncTime="61.455" offset="349184">The suit was brought for trademark infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.587" offset="361723">And as a result of the decision of the Ninth Circuit about three years ago to which this Court then denied review in 1963, we obtained an injunction against the respondents pirating the ‘Black &amp; White' trademark on alcoholic beverages.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.433" offset="437060">Upon concurrent findings of both courts below, it is the law of this case that the respondents' conduct was not only an infringement but that it was willful, fraudulent, and bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.054" offset="487633">And that the only rational explanation of respondents' conduct in adopting the name ‘Black &amp; White' in the first place and then in persistently defying the petitioners when asked to cease and even of carrying the case or attempting to carry it up to this Court was that they were trying to trade on the real ‘Black &amp; White's goodwill, in other words if this was a case of a careless and recalcitrant attitude, a willful and persistent defiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.857" offset="602781">Now, if the Court please, for years, it has been accepted indeed as harmful blow that in trademark infringement suits in the federal courts in equity, federal courts have the power in appropriate and proper circumstances to assess against the infringing defendants, the litigation expenses including attorney's fees which their conduct has imposed upon the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.738" offset="706330">The circumstance on which that power could be and should be exercised has been variously expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.173" offset="732035">But I think they can all be summed up in terms of willful conduct -- willful misconduct where the infringer has acted knowingly and with deliberate purpose to fill the goodwill of the trademark owner and in persistent defiance of the owner's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.924" offset="795042">Now, until this case now before the Court came to the court below, every Federal Court of Appeals had to dealt with this matter, every -- at least every Court of Appeals in which there is any report of the matter, and numerous District Courts have upheld the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.392" offset="864946">And it has been repeatedly been exercised below and above where awards of fees have been affirmed and additional awards have been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.856" offset="902771">Our briefs cites to the Court decisions of the First, Second, Third and Seventh Circuits in trademark cases indeed from the First -- from the Second Circuit, a decision on which this Court denied review just last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.008" offset="959404">We cite decisions on unfair competition cases from the Sixth and the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.712" offset="978213">And one from the Second Circuit handed down just two months ago, a week or two after the petitioner's opening brief was filed in this Court where an award of attorney's fees was justified by the Court because defendant's conduct was described as intentional, vexatious, and fraudulent.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.623" offset="1053863">We cited decisions from the Fourth Circuit which relies on these very trademark decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.807" offset="1074552">And until this case, that had also been the settled law in the whole series of decisions in the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.883" offset="1098898">There were no cases to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.322" offset="1108616">And so after the remand from the Court of Appeals several years ago, we applied to the District Court to enter judgment accordingly and we got our injunction against infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.662" offset="1154069">And proceeding upon this solid and unanimous chain of authority, the District Court then appraised the circumstances and determined in the exercise of its discretion and its appraisal of the facts that an award of fees and litigation expenses should be made and an award was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.649" offset="1221987">An interlocutory appeal was taken to the Ninth Circuit, from that order it allowed and the Ninth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.498" offset="1253334">It overruled its prior decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.029" offset="1263470">In so many words, it said they were bad law.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.673" offset="1274023">And it looked at the decisions from the other Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.938" offset="1287084">And it said as to them, they are not well considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.805" offset="1306624">It said it would not follow them and its conclusion was this, “We hold that attorney's fees are not recoverable in trademark infringement cases under the Lanham Act primarily because the Congress has not provided for them”.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.517" offset="1369422">In other words, the case as it now comes before this Court for consideration presents about as fundamental question in the administration of justice as you could find, namely, a question of the power, of an equity court because the Court of Appeals has held that in no circumstances whatever, has the federal court the power to award attorney's fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="643.353" offset="2676799">Now, in 1939 this Court in the Sprague case held and what it held I think is -- is best summed up in this Court's own language in Vaughan versus Atkinson a couple of years ago or about three years ago in these words.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.990" offset="2755375">And I quote, “As we said in Sprague versus Ticonic Bank, 307 U.S. and so forth, allowance of counsel fees and other expenses entailed by litigation, but not included in the ordinary taxable costs regulated by statute is part of the historic equity jurisdiction of the federal courts."</text>
            <text syncTime="680.311" offset="2824652">And that was not a fund case.</text>

            <text syncTime="684.370" offset="2840848">Now, two years later after this decision came the Aladdin decision in the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.529" offset="2861537">And in the Aladdin case, this is what the Court said, “Counsel fees necessitated by the tort”, this was a trademark case under the Act of 1905, “It had been sent in some instances to be recoverable as part of the compensatory damages in another cases as part of exemplary damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.046" offset="2947532">Now, it's five years later after this, the Lanham Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.803" offset="2966549">The Lanham Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.855" offset="2970833">It has in it the words, the Court allows the cause of the action subject to the principles of equity and my submission is that having -- if we accomplished -- let me put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.396" offset="3012942">Under the Bell and the Sprague case and that it was part of the historic power of the federal court and equity to award cost in an appropriate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.396" offset="3044916">Having the Aladdin case which says that traditionally, a cost on attorney's fees were allowed in trademark cases, along comes the Lanham Act, uses the term subject to the principles of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.699" offset="3090160">And that's why I submit that in that sense, the Lanham Act affirmed the doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.409" offset="3108968">Now, let's suppose the Lanham Act have been totally silent and had nothing on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.912" offset="3127045">The Lanham Act did not confer a jurisdiction on federal courts in trademark cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.044" offset="3143555">Under the diversity of jurisdiction, the federal courts could have had jurisdiction of common law state trademark demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.764" offset="3178454">It is true the Act of 1905 in the Lanham Act put aside the necessity of diversity by giving a jurisdiction based on the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.304" offset="3220564">But unless -- now, I have no doubt at all that Congress by an act would extract -- subtract away from a District Court's power in any particular kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.411" offset="3261001">And so I submit that if the Lanham Act did wanted to subtract that power, it would have to say so expressly and had it said nothing on the subject, the power would still be there, but it went further and said subject to the principles of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.490" offset="3317321">Now, let me go further and make this submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.366" offset="3332786">We submit the trademark cases are peculiarly warranting the exercise of this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.984" offset="3359326">Perhaps I should say at this point, I am not urging the English rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.765" offset="3378448">The English rule -- even though this power derives from traditional equity practice, the English rule comes pretty close to being ‘the prevailing party always gets his attorney's fees'.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.505" offset="3421393">This is not the rule that I know of, that any American court has laid down.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.246" offset="3440306">It's not the rule I have urged.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.064" offset="3451591">The rule I have urged stands out by way contrast to the -- to the English rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.769" offset="3486490">And the English rule in trademark cases has been beautifully set forth in the leading English textbook on trademark litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.399" offset="3529017">I'd like to read this because the contrast is appealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.297" offset="3544586">An unsuccessful defendant must usually pay costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.446" offset="3557125">Although he has only defended the mark which he honestly adopted without being aware of its true great resemblance to the plaintiff's mark and though he has acted without fraud and an ignorance of the plaintiff's rights and the actions has been commenced against him without notice”.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.879" offset="3622849">Now notice, the author of that statement assumes it to be too obvious to need demonstration that from a standpoint of justice and fairness of equity, the trademark infringer ought to pay the attorney's fees where he adopted the trademark in full awareness of the plaintiff's rights, acting fraudulently to profit from plaintiff's goodwill, and defiantly after a notice to cease, none of those elements are necessary in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.605" offset="3717831">We have all those elements necessary here.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.077" offset="3731728">Now, my submission is that there is the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.582" offset="3745729">And the next question is “What are the outer boundaries of the power beyond which a District Court in the exercise of its discretion would be guilty of an abuse of discretion?”</text>

            <text syncTime="1097.105" offset="4491786">The trademark right is recognized and protected under the Lanham Act because it protects not merely the private right but the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.452" offset="4533164">When the Lanham Act was enacted in 1946, the Senate Report which -- upon which the enactment was based contains very pertinent statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.445" offset="4577155">It said the purpose underlying any trademark statute is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.670" offset="4594082">One is to protect the public so it may be confident that in purchasing a product bearing a particular trademark which is favorably knows, it will get the product that is asked for and wants to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.685" offset="4638072">To protect trademarks, therefore, is to protect the public from deceit, foster fair competition, and to secure to the business community advantages of reputation and goodwill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.923" offset="4679032">The emphasis then is that it's not merely the private right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.792" offset="4690526">It's the protection of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.381" offset="4696900">That's the element number one why trademark cases peculiarly had been recognized by the lower courts who's justifying this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.052" offset="4723545">Element number two is that the right being protected in the trademark case while tremendously valuable is intangible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.445" offset="4761161">It's a case of goodwill.</text>

            <text syncTime="1218.731" offset="4978291">It also provides for an accounting of profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.941" offset="4995114">But unless you can prove that the defendant has made some profits, there is nothing there either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.927" offset="5015071">The defendant gaily goes along, diluting your trademark.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.497" offset="5029386">If he puts an inferior product on the market, it dilutes the distinctiveness of your mark.</text>

            <text syncTime="2136.951" offset="8651212">I think the Court analyzed the case thoroughly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.657" offset="8673991">As we see it, this is simply a question of legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.703" offset="8698232">Now, the Congress, as the Court of Appeals points out, knows how to do this and it's quite interestingly I think, it compares the copyright and patent laws where there are some augmented provisions for the award of attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.909" offset="8763016">And in the patent situation, this Court, a good number of years ago, held that attorney's fees could not be recovered in this situation of a patent infringement in the absence of any statutory authority in the acts of Congress relating to patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.763" offset="8830412">Following that, the Congress did then amend those acts to provide for attorney's fees in exceptional extreme cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.366" offset="8872835">It did not do so at anytime in connection with this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.200" offset="8888195">Now, the legislative history according to Court of Appeals is not significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.191" offset="8904182">We're inclined to think that it does have some significance because subsequent to the passage of the immediate Act which has only been amended in regard to the section on damages and other recoveries than injunction, in a technical respect just to correctly site two other sections rather than the one originally cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.263" offset="9016404">But there had been at least two proposals to amend the Act to provide for attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.749" offset="9046392">And neither of the proposals has succeeded and it would look to us, and though the Congress had recognized that the Act did not provide for attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.928" offset="9103130">And some of the proponents of the legislation thought it should be considered by the Congress and resulted in no action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.595" offset="9137716">Granted that that is negative, it is nevertheless, we feel, significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.219" offset="9160286">It shows an awareness of the fact the Act does not now provide in the opinion of the proponents of such bills and the fact that the matter should be subject to congressional review.</text>

            <text syncTime="2756.875" offset="11130859">In other words, as I see it, equity does not create substantive rights but it deals with remedies and always had originally to catch the conscience of the king when he have the final say later to temper the harshness of the common law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2776.538" offset="11209540">Well, the reason I asked you that question, I wasn't clear from the Court of Appeals' opinion with whether or not on the candor of equitable powers of the Court, they said there were no such powers available under the Lanham Act, or whether they said, yes there was power to this but this is not an appropriate case where they're exercised.</text>

            <text syncTime="2794.752" offset="11282369">Well, the Court, I believe, determined that first there was no such power in equity or elsewhere under a pure Lanham Act case to award attorney's fees and that's what we have with the pure Lanham Act case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.383" offset="11344854">They didn't go into the other phases of it and I think that's the meaning when they said primarily because the Act does not provide for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.972" offset="11379231">Now, all of the arguments that didn't made here in the briefs were made through the Court of Appeals in respect to why whether the Act is applied or not, award is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.262" offset="11432417">So those things were rather exhaustibly presented by the respondent -- the appellees there and the petitioners here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.241" offset="11468361">Well, at least the Court of Appeals had those points before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.986" offset="11483303">We have, of course, argued as we do here that we're dealing with the statutory matter and that these other matters were only secondarily involved in the event that was to -- to the contrary of our intention.</text>

            <text syncTime="2880.477" offset="11625305">I might say that as we see it, the request of the petitioners here should not be granted as to requiring even if we're entirely wrong that the Court carry out its judgment because we've reserved all of the issues as to the proper amount as well as all of the evidentiary support issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.157" offset="11707956">They were not passed to form by the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <label>Mr. Moses Lasky</label>
            <text syncTime="2921.202" offset="11788204">Yes, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.154" offset="11791966">I think it comes necessary for me to straighten out the narration of what happened in this case particularly in view of the fact that I say we've been accused of some impropriety here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.866" offset="11834807">When this case was first tried, the trial judge decided for the defendants and on appeal, he was reversed and the Court pointed that he had gone off on a complete misconception of the rule of law, namely that the goods has to be of the same descriptive properties which was the test under the old Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.385" offset="11912861">That was a mistake of a legal application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.019" offset="11923414">The Court of Appeals examined it and had no doubt at all that apart from that, the defendants had been guilty of bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.731" offset="11962284">And in their opinion, they stated and when the case came back down with the trial court advice of the true rule of law, he made a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.897" offset="11994990">And I had assumed that that finding was behind us and we come into the Court upon the basis of that finding which is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.397" offset="12021008">Without seeking legal advise and for the purpose of capitalizing upon the popularity of the name thus chosen, defendant Maier did deliberately adopted the name ‘Black &amp; White' knowing that ‘Black &amp; White' was the name and trademark of the plaintiff Buchanan, and knowing that this popularity would extend to its product because the public would associate the name ‘Black &amp; White' with a long established reliability and meritoriousness of Buchanan's product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.282" offset="12120482">Defendants intended to adopt plaintiff Buchanan's ‘Black &amp; White' name or mark for the purpose of taking advantage of the aura of goodwill which surrounded the name.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.175" offset="12156113">And they deliberately adopted the name with a view to obtaining advantage from the goodwill, good name and good trade, which Buchanan had build up, and expecting that there would be confusion and result in profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.758" offset="12202402">Defendants refused to discontinue their use on beer of the name ‘Black &amp; White' upon request made before a suit filed and they have knowingly, willfully, and deliberately infringed the said marked ‘Black &amp; White' complainant's rights thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.092" offset="12255692">And the Court of Appeals said that this was bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.189" offset="12272097">Now, in their brief here, counsel said that the Court of Appeals finding was without evidence to support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.971" offset="12307205">It was in that connection that in the footnote in my reply brief I quoted some of the evidence in which was before the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.939" offset="12339179">It hadn't been put into the record that brought out there because I thought the finding was behind us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.546" offset="12357569">But if it becomes important, it's in the record of the case and the Court could take judicial notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.541" offset="12381497">Now, when the case went back down, if the Court remanded it for all purposes consistent with its opinion and I made a motion to enter judgment in accordance with the opinion of the Court of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.967" offset="12427264">As for the injunction, attorney's fees, accounting of profits, counsel have its predecessors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.292" offset="12456521">This counsel was not in the case that every opportunity introduced any further evidence they wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.926" offset="12475120">And the matter was submitted in the Court, in due course, entered its order that were entitled to injunction, to an accounting, to a reasonable attorney's fees and set down a time for hearing each one of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.680" offset="12522141">Following it through the procedures of this calendar, it heard the amount of the reasonable attorney's fees first, entered an order while we were still fussing with the accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.789" offset="12558503">An appeal ought not to have been taken at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.316" offset="12568639">This interlocutory appeal was improper and an appeal should have been taken only when the accounting was completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.109" offset="12591835">It has since been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.015" offset="12599463">And there is now an appeal pending from a judgment for the profits too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.503" offset="12621406">When it got up under the Court of Appeals, they properly dismissed this interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.141" offset="12643976">And then over my opposition, the District Court certified that it was an appropriate interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.067" offset="12671666">Again, another appeal was taken and that's how we happen to be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.341" offset="12688697">But now, Your Honor suggested that I was arguing that there should be attorney's fees allowable on a jury tried case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.800" offset="12734568">No, not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.202" offset="12740211">That's an action of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.074" offset="12747630">The equity power would not extend it to it but in an action of law where damages are recovered and proved, we come in under the other section of three times the damages allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.015" offset="12787440">And most trademark cases are in equity as this was in equity because of the impossibility of getting the evidence to prove confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.586" offset="12821713">It was never admitted there was not confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.148" offset="12831953">It was simply the impossibility that the courts have always referred to about getting the evidence of confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.684" offset="12858075">Reference has been made to the patent history in which it has been said that this Court, years ago, held that attorney's fees could not be recovered in the patent case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.922" offset="12891094">On the contrary, what this Court had held in two or three cases a hundred years ago was something rather different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.878" offset="12918888">Counsel fees are not a proper element for the consideration of the jury in the estimation of damages and actions for the infringement of a patent right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.760" offset="12958386">Many patent cases are jury actions because there, you prove the damages because the plaintiff has a monopoly of the product in any sale is a violation.</text>
