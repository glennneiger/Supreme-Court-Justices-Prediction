            <label>Mr. Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="29.385" offset="220871">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.350" offset="236753">This case is here on review of the decision and judgment of the United States Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.273" offset="264443">The Court of Claims held that the Government was not entitled to cancel the contract with Acme Process Equipment Company for the violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute committed allegedly by key officials of that company.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.431" offset="345109">In addition to Court of Claims, disagreeing with its trial commissioner in contrary we say to the traditional measure of damages permitted Acme restitutional relief, that is, it measured Acme's damages by the costs the company had expanded thus putting Acme in the position it occupied before the contract was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.586" offset="445733">That measure resulted, we will contend in an unjustified windfall to Acme since ordinary damages would have been compensated for the loss caused by the breach.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.995" offset="503306">On this hearing, we alleged two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.761" offset="522428">The first issue, the first question to be decided is whether the Government is entitled in the case of this type to cancel a contract because responsible officials of the prime contractor have accepted kickbacks from some contractors in violation of the specific statute prohibiting such kickbacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.880" offset="630888">And the second question is that if the Government was not justified in canceling the contract from statutory violations, then an additional issue is presented as to the proper measure of damages for the alleged breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.239" offset="716361">The salient facts surrounding the kickbacks are as follows: Acme was a company owned by Joshua Epstein, Samuel Fisher, their children and other close relatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.286" offset="768502">They manufactured boilers and other items of the likes -- type of machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.882" offset="794937">In 1952, it became interested in diversifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.774" offset="814477">And in October of that year, it hired James S. Norris and Harry J. Tucker, Jr. who represented themselves as experts in obtaining and administering government procurement contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.466" offset="885217">Indeed, ensure -- Norris was proposed and it was agreed that he would become the General Manager for production and Tucker was placed in charge of sales and government contracts and have proposed new addition to the Acme firm in a plant yet to be leased.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.216" offset="968286">Tucker had already made arrangements with several companies under which he was to receive kickbacks on sales by the companies to customers procured by him and these would include of course Acme.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.566" offset="1029622">Indeed, Tucker agreed to share these kickbacks to Norris.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.334" offset="1048743">One of these companies develops as All Metals Industries which would become the principal subcontractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.616" offset="1085837">Tucker heard that the Army Ordinates Corps in Philadelphia was the contractor, the manufacturer of recoilless rifles, seventy five millimeter rifles; and acting on Tucker's advice that a bid of $350 per rifle would probably insure an award of contract, Acme submitted a bid of $337.23 per rifle.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.327" offset="1192730">Acme's bid was signed by Norris.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.975" offset="1207254">Sometime between the date of the bid and the award of the contracts three months later, the Army Ordinates Corps advised Acme that it was -- it might have been a mistake for them to have hired Tucker because Tucker's father was suspected of kickback activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.163" offset="1291995">But Joshua Epstein, the President of Acme, ignored this advice and made no effort to investigate Tucker despite the fact that Tucker's contract with Acme included a provision that he represent and will continue to represent firms in other lines of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.116" offset="1367855">One point I should mention on the rifles, the bid of three $337.23 was far below any other bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.463" offset="1405262">For example, the two other bids were $484 and $930 respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.011" offset="1435460">And the two final bids were four hundred twenty three and six hundred and eighty four.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.104" offset="1455835">But Acme put in a bid of three hundred thirty seven and twenty-three cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.291" offset="1476524">On January 1953, the contractor for the manufacturing of 2751 recoilless rifles was awarded to Acme as the low bidder.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.547" offset="1529605">But the contracting officials thought Acme's bid might be too low, these were the government officials, and in view of its inexperience in this type of defense work and the Government offered to let Acme withdraw and the offer of Acme refused and let the bid in.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.204" offset="1616227">Of course, as most government contracts in munitions, the project was largely to be subcontracted with Acme furnishing the rifle valve and the finishing and assembling the component parts into the completed rifles.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.908" offset="1679026">Indeed, because of the large amounts of subcontracting, All Metals Industries, the principal subcontractor, whose subcontract was to amount to some one third of the total contract price participated in the negotiations for the prime contract, one between Acme and the Army and its subcontracting plans were reviewed by the Army itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.240" offset="1776306">Within a few weeks after the prime contract was awarded, all three of these companies which Tucker had kickback agreements with, received their subcontracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.926" offset="1823117">Ford Company which had a similar arrangement with Tucker's father also obtained the subcontract from Acme.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.149" offset="1851956">A fifth company got an Acme subcontract upon the recommendation of indeed another man this time, one Phillip Jagner, but he also had a kickback arrangement with the company and who was on Acme's payroll as an assistant to Norris.</text>

          <turn speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="483.543" stopTime="686.647">
            <label>Mr. Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="483.543" offset="2037530">I -- that -- there's nothing in the record to show that anybody but All Metals participated in the actual negotiation of the major contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.740" offset="2078281">But there is evidence that Tucker did and later on Tucker with Epstein's son went to All Metals and made them pay them twenty some thousand dollars more even after the kickback had been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.195" offset="2144110">It would be I -- I would assume sir but it's not in the record that these kickbacks got into the subcontract price.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.107" offset="2179845">I -- it's not in the record but it's usually what happens; and then the contractor in turn passes that inflation on to the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.324" offset="2216626">That's when the interest of the Government comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.945" offset="2235120">There was no question that Tucker and Norris would take in care of Tucker and Norris, I don't think there's any question about that at the expense of anybody they could find.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.442" offset="2285171">The amount of money that All Metals paid was not the twenty-five thousand but the agreement was -- they ask twenty-five thousand, All Metal agreed to pay twenty-three five hundred.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.349" offset="2332818">But interestingly enough allegedly for a “tax gimmick” they had it paid to a dummy corporation which of course turned out to be Tucker and Norris' dummy corporation so that the subcontractor was able to cover up that by giving it to this dummy corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.816" offset="2422680">The -- as you suspected Mr. Justice Harlan, the prime contract proved unprofitable for Acme from the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.972" offset="2459251">And by July of 1954, it delivered less than half of the rifles.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.568" offset="2481612">The average cost to Acme per rifle had become $877.77 and a substantial loss since the contract price was only $337.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.938" offset="2531140">And when the Army learned of the kickbacks, as well as the other's alleged statutory and contractor violation not relevant here because we didn't bring those up, it cancelled the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.498" offset="2585370">There was much negotiation within the Government, the Army and other agencies and eventually this case was heard in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.026" offset="2631450">And it's our position, the -- of course the -- Acme says we have no right to cancel the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.625" offset="2665827">And the kickback arrangement we say were prohibited and no question they were prohibited under the Anti-Kickback Statute which is 41 U.S.C. 51 in our brief, page two to four.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.957" offset="2723192">So in short, that Act makes the payment of a receipt of a kickback between a prime contractor and a subcontractor a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.017" offset="2755480">It also makes amount of the kickback recoverable by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.081" offset="2771675">It does not of course -- it does not provide for cancellation of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.022" offset="2795499">But we contend that the right of cancellation of this contract with the additional sanction of non-enforcement of it is a necessary adjunct to the remedies specified in the Anti-Kickback Statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="889.625" offset="3661824">The reason for that is Dixon and Yates.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.528" offset="3681468">And that's where the -- we part three ways, four ways, the commissioner, the Court of Claims, Acme and the Government on the same case.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.037" offset="3755551">In the Dixon and Yates case, the government contractor, if you remember, had resulted from negotiations which became tainted by a government representative who was also connected with the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.539" offset="3809573">Having found that these individuals' conduct to have violated the Federal Conflict of Interest Statute, this Court upheld the Government's cancellation of the contract and we think that the real test, we can argue the language was both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.822" offset="3874670">But cancellation we urge is necessary in cases of this type, the same as Dixon and Yates to protect the integrity of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.939" offset="3919078">Now on the other hand, Acme and Judge Davis of the court below attempted to distinguish Dixon and Yates on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.620" offset="3961814">The Conflict of Interest Statute involved in Dixon and Yates provided only a criminal sanction and did not have the recovery section and while the Anti-kickback Statute provides in addition to the criminal penalty the civil penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.629" offset="4021896">And secondly, that in this case, the contractor cannot be held responsible for the conduct of its offending officials because it did not have specific knowledge of the kickback activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.807" offset="4082604">While in Dixon and Yates, the contractor knew of the dual status of the government representatives who was obliged to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.106" offset="4111757">Now to this contention the respondents also words that the prime contract is not tainted by the illegality because the kickbacks were paid after the contract had been signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.983" offset="4171316">Well now, we think Dixon and Yates should not be narrowly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.792" offset="4190542">Just as in Dixon and Yates, non-enforcement may fairly be implied here as necessary to effectuate the policy underlying this federal statute preventing corruptness in the federal procurement processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.999" offset="4259401">I think it's even more important to emphasize that a part of the reason which the respondents rely on is that the Government was anxious that they should have this contract if they could do it because they were anxious in getting smaller companies into this type of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.751" offset="4342366">To be sure the statute here involved unlike that in Dixon and Yates provides a civil remedy, it sure does, so the Government could recover the amount of the kickbacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.580" offset="4385729">But that civil remedy does not obviate the principal incurious consequences of the kickbacks themselves because you don't find them out until it's too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.034" offset="4427525">A subcontractor owes his subcontractor a bribe cannot be considered fully liable and to take all the type of protection that they seem to offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.443" offset="4477158">The price of the subcontract may well be inflated by more than the amount of the kickbacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.120" offset="4503803">For a subcontractor who have -- expects to obtain a subcontract in exchange for a bribe has less incentive to make a realistic appraisal of either cost or profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.180" offset="4556048">And unless the Government is entitled to cancel, it will be bound to contracts like this one here conceived in corruptness and on that conceived and corruptness, I come back to your question, Mr. Justice Brennan, not the corruptness of Acme as such but the corruptness of people that Acme has taken in and given responsible positions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2363.774" offset="9558497">I think, although this was an issue before the Court of Claims, I believe it had nothing to do actually with the kickback arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.167" offset="9600084">This was something which was apart and separate and involved Acme in its subcontract and not the Government and Acme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.505" offset="9637386">They were two separate issues entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.441" offset="9649089">In fact at the time that the first representation was made, there had been no kickbacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.760" offset="9686392">So obviously, it had nothing to do with it at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.772" offset="9702484">I think it's very important to consider the congressional purpose in enacting the Anti-Kickback Act back in the 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.507" offset="9745429">At that time most of the defense contracts were being awarded on a cost-plus basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.284" offset="9768521">In other words, the contractor would perform work for the Government on the basis of being paid as (Inaudible) cost plus maybe a fixed fee for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.432" offset="9825050">The general accounting office undercovered that there were kickbacks such as gifts being paid by subcontractors to employees of a prime contract to -- or which in turn it was being passed on to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.271" offset="9880430">Therefore it was increasing the cost of the Government and the Government obviously was getting no benefit out of these gratuities being paid by subcontractors to prime contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.978" offset="9935287">The Congress in its committee report pointed out that at that time, it was extremely doubtful as to whether there was any way the Government could sue or otherwise recover these kickbacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.636" offset="9989935">And this is the clear stated congressional purpose in enacting the Act to prevent the Government from bearing the cost of these kickbacks to give the Government a civil remedy to sue and recover back the kickbacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.551" offset="10053569">A criminal penalty was added to further discourage kickbacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.707" offset="10078229">The Act as it was originally enacted back in '46 applied to cost-plus or cost-reimbursible type contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.219" offset="10116263">Now, Acme's contract was a fixed-price contract although the price could be renegotiated within some very narrow limits upward and downward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.763" offset="10158373">It was because of the type of contract that the District Court in the criminal prosecution of Norris and Epstein and Tucker found that the 1946 Act did not apply because this was not the type of contract which Congress had in mind when they enacted the 1946 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.540" offset="10249488">Judge Clark in the criminal case recommended that the Attorney General propose amendatory legislation to Congress to extend the application of the Act to cover all types of contract such as the Acme contract and this was the reason why the Act was amended in 1960 to cover all negotiated contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.169" offset="10356067">There was a decision in the Tenth Circuit, the Barnard case which the Government of course relies on but we feel it's entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.301" offset="10392534">There was a fixed-price contract subject to renegotiation but there was no limitation on the amount of renegotiation as far as upward or downward on prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.376" offset="10440913">Also, there was a cost-plus facilities contract for machinery where General Motors was a prime contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.262" offset="10472469">So the Barnard case we submit is entirely different and this was recognized in the committee reports that Barnard did not settle this question and it was for that purpose in 1960 that Congress said, “We're going to make this Act applicable to all negotiated contracts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.920" offset="10543104">The Act was unchanged in all other respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.516" offset="10557419">Now the Government of course relies heavily on the Dixon and Yates case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.157" offset="10576018">Dixon and Yates involved a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.289" offset="10588557">We have a criminal statute here but we also have a civil statute, a statute which says the Government shall have the right to sue and recover the kickbacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.873" offset="10630875">The Court of Claims held as one of their reasons for rejecting the Government's defense that Congress by enacting a specific civil remedy precluded any other remedy if one exist -- existed prior to the enactment of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.791" offset="10702555">Of course, we submit also and I think the Court of Claims so found that there was no such remedy prior to the enactment of the Anti-Kickback Acts such as contract cancellation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.351" offset="10756786">Dixon and Yates we submit is entirely different for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.453" offset="10773191">In Dixon and Yates, we're talking about a contract which grew out of an illegal transaction.In fact, the court in Dixon and Yates cited two cases, Miller versus Ammon and Bank of the United States versus Owens, to the effect that a contract is not to be enforced when it arises out of circumstances that would lead enforcement to defend the essential purpose of the enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.348" offset="10880815">These two cases were entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.696" offset="10894190">The Ammon case involved a contract of the sale of wine without a liquor license, obviously an illegal contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.051" offset="10927626">The Bank of the United States versus Owens case involved a suit on a usurious note.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.895" offset="10955003">Again, the contract here was illegal ab initio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.092" offset="10975692">In other words it was bored form the beginning because of the illegality attached to the origination of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.470" offset="11001292">In Dixon and Yates, the violation of the Conflict of Interest Statute was one of the facts that led to the award of the contract, had it not been for Mr. Winzel's (ph) activities as the Court remarked, perhaps this contract would never have been awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.492" offset="11085302">So here we have a situation where a contract arises from or grows out of an illegal bargain, a violation of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.484" offset="11121351">But here in Acme's case, we had no such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.889" offset="11134934">There was no violation of a statute in the award of Acme's contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.226" offset="11152280">The Anti-kickback Act was not violated in the award of Acme's contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.223" offset="11172237">If there was any violation of the Anti-Kickback Act, and we submit there was not, then it occurred after the award of the contract to Acme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.319" offset="11212675">If, as the Government says and I might point out this point too, that in the Government's amended answer, that is their answer to plaintiff's third amended petition in the Court of Claims which was not filed until 1961, should -- having been filed in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.475" offset="11293236">The Government for the first time relied specifically on the Anti-kickback Act, in there it was the 1960 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.802" offset="11326568">Now, to bring the case anywhere within the Dixon and Yates case, they must refer to the criminal section of the Anti-Kickback Act that is Section 4 rather than the civil aspect of it because the civil aspect merely gives a right to sue to recover back the kickbacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.105" offset="11415803">This we submit is not only manifestly unfair and unjust since the 1960 amendment resulted from this very contract but it would also violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws, they would be relying on a criminal penalty for a violation of an act which did not exist at the time the alleged violation occurred but resulted from the amendment of a statute which occurred some seven years later.</text>
