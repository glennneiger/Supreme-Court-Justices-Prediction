            <label>Mr. Luke McKissack</label>
            <text syncTime="82.993" offset="435388">I'm almost positive that it was in the petition for certiorari, but of course I could be mistaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.199" offset="456182">The first issue within be the question of a confession of the -- of a co-defendant in whether or not it could be limited to the declarant not to a non-declarant not used against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.752" offset="494425">Then, the duo counsel in Fifth Amendment questions first, the lineup issue and in the issue of handwriting exemplars and if time permits, I would then like to reach the issue of search and seizure and the comp -- and the effects of a violation if there was in fact a violation of search and seizure laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.276" offset="564433">Now, first directing my attention to the question of the confession issue and as used against the co-defendant, I would point out that I think that the reason -- array of judicial decisions and the Court's own judicial intuition would point out that this is one of the most troublesome spots of a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.657" offset="629948">If we were to single out any particular problem where limiting instructions are demonstrably insufficient, I would think it would be in the area where you have a joint trial with two defendants and in this case both on trial for their lives and we have a confession, a complete confession by one which it implicates the other man.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.665" offset="709987">And in this case not only implicates him but you have statements made which are brought in against only the co-defendant King here which purports to say that Gilbert admitted killing a police officer and said, before he was finished, he was going to kill some more.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.617" offset="769860">Further statement showing that Gilbert attempted to kill his co-defendant after the completion of the bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.893" offset="794937">I think this is particularly pertinent if we view this as it is, a death penalty case against the background of California Penal Code Statute 190.1 which is erroneously printed in page 3 of our reply brief, is I think 1900 or 9090 but 190.1 which throws the death penalty versus life imprisonment issue in California completely in the lap of the jury without any kind of criteria whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.094" offset="899741">They have a complete freehand to consider all factors and mitigation, all factors and aggravation and then arrive upon a decision with no reasonable doubt criteria or anything, a complete decision, a decision as to whether the man should live or die.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.194" offset="960136">And we have brought before the jury something that would otherwise be inadmissible if it were not to the fact that this was a joint trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.032" offset="987512">But being a joint trial, the jury heard the same jury that decided the guilt of this man and had to adjudicate or had to decide the penalty also heard the statement which set in effect that this man had killed the policeman and was going to kill more.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.531" offset="1049475">And I can't imagine anything that could have a more devastating impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.422" offset="1065044">Now, although the Aranda decision in the California Courts is merely a policy decision by the Court I feel that it hits the crux of what we got here.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.265" offset="1100466">I feel that we have a situation that goes far beyond the yields of Jackson versus Denno because you have a situation where the jury is instructed not merely to consider the remarks of the declarant -- against the declarant, and not against the other individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.480" offset="1173295">We have a situation where -- unlike in Jackson versus Denno where they have to make a preliminary determination as to whether certain evidence is admissible and then either reject it or consider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.757" offset="1222405">We have a situation here where they're told to consider it and not consider it the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.115" offset="1239855">They are told to go in there and deliberate as practical men about whether or not King is telling the truth when he says that he and Weaver and Gilbert planned a bank robbery and that it was committed as King explained that it happened and then deciding whether or not that's the truth for purposes of King and then turning around under a limiting instruction in saying even though we have decided that it's true insofar as King is concerned we're to regard it as untrue insofar as Gilbert is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="386.085" offset="1647679">I'm not willing to say that there could never be a case where there -- that there were not be harmed committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.841" offset="1666696">But focusing upon the nearest analogous area that we have which are confession cases, this Court has held categorically throughout all the cases that have been presented, that where you have a confession involved, there's no point really inquiring into prejudice because you can't tell how much damage is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.293" offset="1724583">Now, I'm pointing out but we not only have a confession here which mentions Gilbert 159 times, describes his role in the robbery, points out that he's a past cop killer, and he threatens to kill cops in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.332" offset="1764707">But we also have a death penalty issue, it was not a reasonable doubt standard being presented to the jury and thrown entirely in the lap of the jury as to whether this man should live or die.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.934" offset="1799084">And obviously one of the questions is whether he is real -- to rehabilitate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.057" offset="1815594">And I feel therefore that any instruction that was given and a traditional one was that you cannot consider this as to Gilbert would be completely ineffectual.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.616" offset="1849866">And I think that it used the language of a past justice of this Court, indeed it was a peep beyond the compass of ordinary minds.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.526" offset="1877452">I don't think that the jury could have done this.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.408" offset="1896991">Now, of course I -- to distinguish this case from the earlier decision that we have here in Delli Paoli although I don't think this distinction need be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.468" offset="1933249">In the Delli Paoli situation, there was no showing I don't think of an illegally introduced statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.468" offset="1953207">It was a question of being legal -- legally introduced inadmissible against the man that was introduced against, but it had no right to radiate and affect the other defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.713" offset="1986226">Now, on this case so the California Supreme Court held that the statement against the declarant itself was inadmissible and therefore concluded that the only basis for having a joint trial and allowing this kind of a statement in on the grounds that if you're going to grant a joint trial and certainly there are values to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.687" offset="2050069">And if you're going to say to the prosecution you can't have a joint trial then certainly the prosecution would like to get in admissions or confessions against the party that made them.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.897" offset="2090924">You don't even have that justification because the evidence that was introduced against the co-defendant King was held to have been illegally obtained.</text>

            <text syncTime="751.325" offset="3108655">I think he's looking at it as a practical matter that it -- most any defense counsel would -- they concede that this is one of the most troublesome problems in the law because even though a judge and there might be a distinction here because I should bring to the attention of the Court, California has not used Aranda across the board in court trial situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.571" offset="3177618">California has acknowledged that a judge for example might be able to work two hats at one time, a judge appreciates exclusionary rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.654" offset="3206040">He recognizes that certain kinds of cases that there maybe overwhelming evidence but it's illegally obtained, the case goes out, the case is dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.872" offset="3234879">But this is not something that's usually within the education and the understanding of a jury, as a matter of fact the last instruction to the jury in all California cases ends with a conclusion that their sole task is the ascertainment of the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.363" offset="3284825">And I would venture to say that when a jury goes in to the jury room this is what they have in mind and a notion of an exclusionary rule or a limiting instruction where you considered only against some and not as against others embraces a concept for you recognize that there are other purposes that may in sense collide with the total objective of total ascertainment of the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.257" offset="3364446">It may cause them to put certain things out of their mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.961" offset="3375208">And I cannot imagine a more drastic situation than the one that is presented here and that is where they just can't erase it.</text>

            <text syncTime="928.165" offset="3816051">Basically, as I understand it it's a sort of a congressional adoption of the policies in Miranda and the recognition of the fact that he really can't have a fair trial under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.184" offset="3860146">The trust of what I'm suggesting is that if we have statements that the Government says, “Alright, we're going to introduce these statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.725" offset="3886268">We need these statements”.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.153" offset="3892015">The next question for the judge to ask is, “Alright, can we delete references to the co-defendants, so satisfactorily that he will not be prejudiced”.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.130" offset="3919914">If this can be done then of course joint trial should continue, of course the statement should be admitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="965.664" offset="3965994">And this I think is an essence to the thrust of Aranda, and Aranda relies heavily upon what I think is implicit in the reasoning of Jackson versus Denno and that is a realistic analysis of the fair trial situation in this kind of context where a jury is asked to do something that even a lawyer would find difficult or a judge would find difficult.</text>

            <text syncTime="1003.840" offset="4118758">I am attempting to put this in a Sixth Amendment context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.137" offset="4135894">I think that there are decisions from this Court that hold amongst other things that the right to counsel is not limited to merely being an adjunct or protector of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.896" offset="4171003">There are a number of decisions on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.821" offset="4178631">Obviously, in the in trial phase, the Sixth Amendment is not limited to protecting merely the Fifth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.298" offset="4200573">As Justice Friendly pointed out in one of the -- in a dissent in one of the companion cases to Gilbert, obviously, if we were in trial, the jury was selected, defense counsel standing there and it is suggested that the defendant adorned himself in a certain way, maybe wear a baseball cap if that's what the robber wore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.848" offset="4270791">That perhaps you could have them do this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.645" offset="6585971">The lawyer could say to the prosecutor, “I think it would be a fair test if the witnesses were excluded which is a requirement under California law and in fact in most states, as far as I know, and let each witness come in one at a time and draw his own conclusions, and make his own identification.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.624" offset="6645844">Now, one thing that occurred to me en route to Washington on this matter is that -- I know the Government is emphasizing that counsel is more or less a rouge in a sense that the only thing he can do is to crap the case for the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.236" offset="6696312">But I'm suggesting that we have all kinds of precedent in our law, if we go outside the criminal appeal, for informal proceedings which don't necessarily leave the counsel becoming a harmful force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.781" offset="6734451">For example, in depositions, in civil cases, normally you just have two counsels present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.013" offset="6755453">You're entitled to make objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.655" offset="6762036">Normally the objections are made and people are permitted to answer and then the judge will later make rulings on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.827" offset="6782725">But I don't think that we can necessarily embrace the conclusion that because the prosecutor and defense counsel are there without the presence of a judge or the mandatory presence of a judge that it's necessary going to leave the hostility that some of these problems can't be worked out, that they won't agree that the witnesses should be segregated and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.140" offset="6855973">Plus the fact you do have the added boon that the counsel is present, he observes what's going on and he is in a sense a talking witness to the fairness of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.318" offset="6892648">And at this point I would call upon the strong language in Miranda which so eloquently suggests that having counsel present is a valid view when you're going to extract something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.675" offset="6934026">Now, of course, the taking of blood, it travels through -- let say, through a syringe and then into a tube and I don't suppose there's anything that counsel can do to interrupt this journey.But the -- if counsel is present, you're not going to have coerced confessions or certainly not as much as you would otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.261" offset="6988466">Counsel, I think can present -- prevent this and if counsel is present, you're not as likely to have an unfair lineup which can be more factually and more accurately exploited at trial if it occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.907" offset="7030993">And if counsel just has to ask routine questions about well, where were people and so forth, he's on the scene and I suggest that counsel's presence is a positive benefit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1757.409" offset="7132975">Yes, I think that the -- I think that they would thrust themselves in that direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.006" offset="7147395">But I do not feel that this Court would be required to say that because the same arguments would apply to a post arrest situation, pre-indictment, and necessarily we must decide that -- for example, if I may refer to be absent justice knowing -- the voting on Massiah and Escobedo, I don't think it would necessitate a conclusion that the rule should not be applied in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.582" offset="7245720">Because as I suggest in my brief, really all they (Inaudible) by the Government, suggesting that, “Well, why don't you have counsel on the scene at the time the defendants picked up as a suspect or where his fingerprinted here and then so forth?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.385" offset="7292949">These are not, as I see it, pointing out positive evils.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.759" offset="7306428">These only points out the fact that our judicial system as is developed with the manpower available and under all the circumstances, we haven't found it either beneficial or necessary to supply counsel of that particular stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.319" offset="7352613">I'm not of all convinced that it wouldn't be desirable in an ideal situation in a future situation that to have both the prosecutor and defense counsel present perhaps even a magistrate ideally, when ballistics test are made, when finger print tests are made and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.557" offset="7413635">I'm not arguing for that proposition by -- I wish to point out that I think the fallacy committed by the opposition here is to try to carry our argument to such an extreme by labeling these occurrences as things that should not happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.728" offset="7462327">And therefore concluded there's no real difference because it's still the same process, such a lineup no matter when it occurs and therefore there shouldn't be counsel in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.410" offset="7493047">I think that they don't point out that counsel shouldn't be present in the other cases it's just that we haven't found it necessary to attach counsel at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.826" offset="7526693">A consequence in this particular case of saying if we were to assume the opposite -- suppose we assumed that counsel should not be present at a lineup, then I think there's a great, great requirement here as to what -- what are the limitations of the right to counsel or when should he be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.947" offset="7583117">We had the man arraigned, probable cause has been found, he's gone through an indictment or preliminary hearing, the next thing that is necessary is to stand trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.068" offset="7615613">Now does this mean that the defendant then is in a sense -- can be conscript -- conscripted at any moment by the police out to take various test and without consultation of counsel and many of these tests may or may not involve the Fifth Amendment, that's the point I'm trying to bring in to play.</text>

            <text syncTime="1926.647" offset="7809964">A categorical rule for counsel, a lineup is a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.706" offset="7822190">Now, I would agree that then there's a separate question that if there's a violation of the right, what's the consequence?</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.516" offset="7841416">I think that there should be a right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.376" offset="7848835">I always -- I don't think this Court should lay down a rule that we're going to retroactively determine whether counsel should've been present because of what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.272" offset="7876420">I think this Court should say that counsel after he's been arraigned, has a -- it should -- has a right to be present or his presence is waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.275" offset="7904423">Then comes the question which Your Honors been dwelling upon and that is what's the effect of him not being there?</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.263" offset="7924381">And if I were to address myself to that, the Court would have I think a choice between a categorical rule which would be to say if it were an in-trial court situation, the case would automatically be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.144" offset="7971924">As a matter of fact, in Hamilton versus Alabama the situation where the counsel was not present in the arraignment, they have a reversal of the death penalty murder case and I point out that in Hamilton none of the rights which are pointed out as making it a critical stage of the Alabama arraignment procedure, none of these rights were necessarily constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.338" offset="8052694">So this is another example of the fact that counsel in that case was not there just to protect the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2122.130" offset="8591862">But I think that the -- just like in the Sixth Amendment right to counsel cases, I think that every single -- if counsel goes -- if a defendant goes to trial and he's never asked if he wants an attorney and he goes through it, there's no way where I think it should be reversed and there should never be an inquiry to prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.936" offset="8655078">Why not, because he may not have been prejudiced, but I don't think the rule is so drastic.</text>

            <text syncTime="2143.687" offset="8678170">And this is a thrust of my whole argument in this case where I'm trying to keep the Sixth Amendment clear of the Fifth, because if you're going to attach the Sixth to the Fifth, you've got to make a retroactive determination of whether the Fifth was violated before he decided, whether he should've had the Sixth Amendment right to counsel which must -- a decision which must be made before the Fifth Amendment comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.569" offset="8749641">And that's what I want to avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.463" offset="8757269">But if we take the middle rule, I would suggest that it would have to be remanded where a determination as to whether or not the in court eyewitness identification was substantially and I realize this is a vague term affected by the proceedings at the lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.635" offset="8821948">But I don't think it's any more of vague test than -- we have to say a poison tree -- a fruit language, where all the Court can really do is to sort of put a verbal standard out and roughly suggest what the Court is trying to suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.457" offset="8869177">That is that a tainted fruit of an illegal search should not be introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.275" offset="8884433">But recognizing that this principle can go too far, a language is thrown out about so attenuated as to dissipate the taint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.875" offset="8914840">It's impossible to pin that down as to what it means but it does indicate that there comes a point where you can go too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.417" offset="8941066">And so I would suggest if the Court took the middle position that the case should be remanded, so that a full pledged hearing can be heard on exactly what happened at the lineup -- whether self-incrimination is involved and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.899" offset="8986937">But the prejudice -- prejudicial factors that came into play, whether the witnesses' opinion as to -- whether they saw Gilbert was in fact fortified, bolstered, or made by what they saw at the lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.163" offset="9036048">And I think that's the thrust of my contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.055" offset="9043571">It's not the answer of the Sixth Amendment to the Fifth, but let it stand as it is because it's a simple requirement and I think it's an important one.</text>

            <text syncTime="2547.969" offset="10295254">And number two, I think when you got control of the defendant, there are number of things he might do to injure his case without the presence of counsel that he can't do and he's nothing but a picture on a page.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.229" offset="10336319">But for example, in Gilbert's case as a -- one of the witnesses pointed out this -- that he seemed a little reluctant to speak, or he was very soft and looks like he's trying to avoid the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.154" offset="10376025">Now this can in a sense, tend to be self-incriminatory because he feels he's got something to hide and therefore he shows nervous etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.113" offset="10403819">So, I think you have some distinctions but I think the argument of the Court would be that if these are parallel, that is you're looking at someone in a lineup, you're looking at someone in a photo, that it doesn't necessarily lead to the conclusion that because we have not attached the right to counsel when a photograph is being examined, we're not going to do it whether there's a lineup involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.288" offset="10472573">They are the differences I've pointed out plus the fact that we have just not held that is necessary or that critical that a defendant counsel be present when a photograph is taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.450" offset="10525132">And I would again refer to what the language of -- matching of cases on irrelevant facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.401" offset="10544985">I think the critical thing here is to gear the Sixth Amendment to a phase of the proceedings and not direct to whether it's going to be a photographs, a lineup, handwriting exemplars, blood tests, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.620" offset="10585840">I feel that that's going to involved -- you need a prospective analysis and that's going to involve a lot of questions and those -- those categories all over them are not entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.194" offset="10616142">They may either be self-incriminatory, they'll be harmful for other reasons and they aren't necessarily entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.832" offset="10638712">And I would point out there are some precedent because in England, the Solicitor attends lineups and I don't think there's any showing that the English judicial system -- interrogation is broken down, and we have it on -- in the City of Philadelphia a similar example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.555" offset="10697644">And as I say in the State of California, the statute was violated but called for a judge to make a determination as to whether Mr. Gilbert should've been wished away for any purpose, lineup, or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.203" offset="10744142">Now, on the question of the Fifth Amendment, I would just make one comment on the right to lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.464" offset="10757204">I think that there were at least two or three incriminating comments that were obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.608" offset="10777788">When he's asked where he was arrested, he's in a dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.190" offset="10788133">If he answers truthfully, he says, “Philadelphia” the witnesses there know the robber was arrested in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.526" offset="10805478">If he answers falsely, that if he knows the smattering of law or even from common sense, he may assume that it could be used against him in trial which we would call impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.331" offset="10836720">He's asked what kind of a car he owns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.712" offset="10842258">If he names the right car, he names the car of the robber.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.114" offset="10855842">He's -- he was also asked whether he was armed at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.298" offset="10868590">And in this trial, and the California Court held this to be erroneously admitted, it was pointed out that he own the 45 -- he had a 45 weapon on him at the time that he was apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.560" offset="10905579">They held this was error and as a matter of fact the policeman was killed by a 45 weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.962" offset="10923238">And at the lineup, one of the questions was asked, “Were you armed?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.542" offset="10933582">If he answers, “Yes”, he says, “45 weapon”, this is incriminatory, besides, it makes him a suicidal menace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.628" offset="10953853">And in addition, the fact that he's apprehended in Philadelphia when the crime occurs in California suggest to the witnesses, the perspective witnesses, that this is (Inaudible), and that's also harmful to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.539" offset="10997530">So, I feel that this is another advantage of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.771" offset="11010487">Counsel might have been able to consult with the district attorney and say, “Alright, we'll segregate the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.685" offset="11030131">Let them make identifications one by one”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.861" offset="11042774">Maybe after this is done, if there's a value that can sense his identification, they could all be grouped into the same room.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.554" offset="11065553">And then they can make identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.423" offset="11073076">But I think the counsel could have assured that, he could have prevented the self-incriminatory questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.867" offset="11090840">One thing I do seek to avoid is that in -- depending upon whether it's a Stovall or Wade case, there have been -- the lower court has criticized the position I have taken particularly, people speaking against the position, by I think reducing it to an absurdity and making them take the position they don't take, like what's counsel going to do, tell the defendant to wear a mask?</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.179" offset="11168057">I'm not urging that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.957" offset="11171192">But, what's he's going to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.296" offset="11176521">Just tell him not to go there at all?</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.125" offset="11187911">Our position is not bottomed on those assumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.272" offset="11196479">It's bottomed on the fact that predictability is a value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.354" offset="11208808">Having counsel there, we may clean up a lot of these problems and if may call to mind, one of the cases I heard this morning, it's like a San Francisco or Washington ordinance case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.064" offset="11247679">If you find as a matter of empirical fact that everyone is consenting to something and there's no real problem, then -- you know, you would have evaluate it in terms of circumstances you actually find and we should encourage here as little violations of law and Fifth Amendment problems as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.963" offset="11311208">And the presence of counsel I think would point towards us in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.231" offset="11332315">Probably I just point out that I think Miranda doesn't subject counsel into the interrogation process because they realize that there's a value in having there and the same argument would make for this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Luke McKissack</label>
            <text syncTime="2828.664" offset="11417997">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.388" offset="11420923">I -- perhaps each question involved here would have to evaluated differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.469" offset="11441298">But the Court would have of course had a choice as to what kind of test it would apply in the lineup situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.195" offset="11464182">If they were in counsel, obviously, ipso facto reversal of this before you could -- if you choose a Fahy like test, I would suggest that when we're talking about the Sixth Amendment with something so easily to comply with that we should have across the board test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.227" offset="11516322">If not, we're talking about the effect of the error and the choice is to either treat this case as I say, and I think it should be treated as the case that makes the lawyer enunciates the rule as a value and not inquiring -- introduce your prejudice to support this, historically, we've never done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.871" offset="11578807">In Griffin versus California, they -- well, it could've been asked, “Alright, suppose there was comment, now, what's the effect of it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.338" offset="11600750">The Court hasn't done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.704" offset="11606183">And I think that there is a value to not doing it this particular case but the Court could at the same time suggest that obviously maybe there'd be a de minimis rule so that -- if there's a tiniest infraction of the law, a case shouldn't be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.746" offset="11654353">I think that those points of view can be squared quite easily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.980" offset="11675251">Now, if I may turn to the handwriting exemplar argument, on the Sixth Amendment, I think we can just simply state this is the lineup question except for the fact that where in Escobedo situation and not in Massiah.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.560" offset="11733661">And the question would be, “What is the difference between a person under arrest and a person who has been arraigned?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.155" offset="11751946">And I think that this is been fully briefed and the Court has considered this and that the only thing I can say is that there is a difference clearly between say an arraignment situation and a post arrest situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.923" offset="11803042">There, we know there's a great difference, where they're searching to see if a crime is committed and trying to find out who committed it, a lot of questions can be asked and properly so.Scenes can be surveyed, pictures can be taken, a lot of things can be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.089" offset="11847764">Once he's focused, once a person is arrested, once there's probable cause, then we get into an area where perhaps the right to counsel should attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.024" offset="11875453">I would argue that the right to counsel should attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.433" offset="11885066">But I would -- at the same time maintain that if it doesn't attach at the time that defendant has been arrested, it certainly should attach the time that he's gone before a -- there's been a grand jury indictment, he's been informed against -- an informal judicial proceedings have begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.254" offset="11940342">And I would point out on the Fifth Amendment involving handwriting exemplars, that -- there has been a suggestion previously about lie detectors, perhaps this is protected by the Fifth Amendment while other forms of evidence aren't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.682" offset="11986108">I think this is very tricky and very difficult question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.437" offset="11997080">I think the handwriting exemplar could be viewed either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.411" offset="12013066">Certainly, it's different than taking the blood in some senses, the question is, “Is the difference does or not to a distinction or the other way around?”</text>

            <text syncTime="3002.259" offset="12112436">And in an area like this, I think it would commit the Court too an examination of the scientific data, the moment of time to decide if that was in fact the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.732" offset="12150262">Plus the fact that you may assume that even if it was scientific, it doesn't necessarily mean that it is not self-incriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.199" offset="12176175">I think upon probing into it that the Fifth Amendment to some extent just rest upon this rule -- concerns and is nonetheless for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.065" offset="12207626">I think that there are some facets of it that is difficult to analytically tie down to some particular purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.851" offset="12234794">It's not purely a question of how scientific a test is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.149" offset="12247960">Its -- can be expressed in the popular jargon, we don't cause people to dig their own graves and this has a meaning to some people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.989" offset="12271365">And in fact I would point out that in the philosophical literature in the field of criminal law, the English philosopher H.L.A. Hart is probably dedicated and made his greatest contribution by pointing out that many of our criminal laws are not -- many of our criminal laws are not premised entirely upon the ideas that we think, they are like deterrents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.057" offset="12351613">For example, you've got a question of insanity or drunkenness, the old utilitarian school of Jeremy Bentham which say, “Give him a steeper penalty”, and the analysis shows that the reason we treat insane people lightly is not because an across-the-board penalty wouldn't be a better deterrent because its only -- maybe one or two, he would feign insanity or creep within the category he might be deterred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.960" offset="12435205">But we do it because of the considerations that we think its right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.893" offset="12446908">It just seems to square with our notions or our values at a given moment in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.475" offset="12461223">The same distinction between, say omissions and acts, a person shoots the man on the beach that's murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.469" offset="12481285">If he sees the man drowning, he doesn't rescue him, and the person is not a relative or friend, it's an omission to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.700" offset="12502183">It maybe reprehensible but we don't classify it the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.820" offset="12514617">And I think that there is a guttural or literal premise under the Fifth Amendment that we can't fight -- put our hands on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.675" offset="12538023">And so, it just doesn't require an analysis of how scientific evidence is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.456" offset="12553174">In handwriting, the defendant is required to actively procure evidence against himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.683" offset="12570102">He has to create evidence that didn't otherwise exist and even though as I would concede, these factors of this rule, I think that it does go into the question because it coincides of what people think about what the Fifth Amendment ought to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.188" offset="12628093">And I think that's fair.</text>
