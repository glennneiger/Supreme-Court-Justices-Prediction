            <text syncTime="40.894" offset="266951">Petitioner, Mr. Long was arrested in Iowa on April 9th of 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.323" offset="292655">On April 10th he was taken before the Justice of the Peace where his preliminary occurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.718" offset="318255">At that time, he was not represented by counsel and as the record shows in the case, a plea of “guilty” was recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.257" offset="356394">The petitioner being indigent, Your Honors, was incarcerated for some six months before he came up for trial in October of 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.561" offset="397667">At that time, no less than 11 questions were directed at the petitioner concerning admissions that he made at the preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.015" offset="431417">Some of these questions were objected to and the objections were sustained but others he was forced to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.686" offset="458167">He was convicted of larceny in Iowa and the jury there sets the amount of the thing in value which he stole in this case, it was a pump which was valued at $25.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.944" offset="515114">He was sentenced to four months in penitentiary for a term not to exceed five years.</text>

            <text syncTime="116.765" offset="570389">Now his court-appointed counsel did, Your Honor, appeal the case but the appeal did not raise the White vs. Maryland point which we have urged to the Court that exists on his habeas corpus claims here.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.455" offset="625142">The appeal on the case involved itself for the lack of speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.444" offset="645099">The Iowa Supreme Court deemed his delay regrettable in getting to trial but affirmed his conviction and thereafter, well, at Fort Madison Penitentiary, he filed the action which now brings this cause to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.481" offset="701315">He filed a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, alleging certain claims including the fact that his court appointed counsel was incompetent and that he was denied his White vs. Maryland rights at the preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.131" offset="759933">The Lee County District Court, which is the county wherein Fort Madison Penitentiary is located, set the case for an evidentiary hearing and the cause came on for evidentiary trial at which time witnesses were called and evidence taken on the petitioner's habeas corpus claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.029" offset="835480">The Lee County District Court dismissed the petitioner's application for habeas corpus in an order stating that the petitioner had not carried the burden or for other reasons the claims were not viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.251" offset="896397">The petitioner filed a timely Notice of Appeal from his denial of habeas corpus and thereafter filed an Application for a Transcript of his evidentiary hearing for purposes of preparing a meaningful appeal on the habeas corpus denial to the Supreme Court of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.246" offset="972361">The Lee County District Court passed upon the Application for Transcript and it stated in an Order denying the Application for Transcript that habeas corpus being a civil proceeding in Iowa, there was no right to the transcript of the evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.170" offset="1044041">Petitioner then filed a Petition for Certiorari to the Supreme Court of Iowa -- his appeal is still pending at this time, Your Honors -- requesting that the Supreme Court of Iowa enter an order directing that he receive a transcript of his evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.982" offset="1103287">The Supreme Court of Iowa at this time summarily denied his Application for Certiorari, citing to the case of Waldon vs. District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.849" offset="1146755">In the cited case, the Waldon case, credence was again given to the civil label of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.493" offset="1173295">As a means, we submit of denying constitutionally protected rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.891" offset="1194924">Petitioner then filed a Petition for Certiorari to this Court and the matter comes on for hearing on the question of, is the petitioner entitled on an appeal from a habeas corpus denial to a transcript under equal protection of the law?</text>

            <text syncTime="555.879" offset="2326862">The petitioner himself tried to obtain the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.017" offset="2351417">Central to our position here, Your Honors, is the point that appeal is a matter of right in habeas corpus in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.707" offset="2382242">The petitioner (Inaudible) was able to appeal his denial of habeas corpus and obtain full and meaningful appellant review.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.465" offset="2413275">The petitioner, Mr. Long -- the indigent and Mr. Long's position is precluded from doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.245" offset="2448384">He – basically, he is in the position, we submit, of the petitioner in Lane vs. Brown or the defendants in Griffin vs. Illinois being foreclosed from meaningful appeal because of the lack of transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.306" offset="2524557">And, we submit that it is clear the Griffin is made applicable for post-conviction remedies by virtue of Smith vs. Bennett, which case arose out of our jurisdiction as well as Lane vs. Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.723" offset="2582235">Now the question is, is a transcript necessary to obtain meaningful review from your habeas corpus denial?</text>
            <text syncTime="629.068" offset="2619643">Well, the Iowa Supreme Court has recently passed on this connection in connection with direct appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.705" offset="2646183">In the case of Weaver v. Herrick, which I have cited in my Brief, the Iowa Supreme Court was presented with the question, what is necessary for meaningful review under the Iowa rules?</text>
            <text syncTime="646.678" offset="2690069">And the Court said in Weaver vs. Herrick that to provide the indigent with any kind of meaningful appeal under the Iowa appeal rules, a full transcript is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.939" offset="2731133">That is the rule on Iowa on direct appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.050" offset="2743568">Question is, why does a different rule prevail in habeas corpus?</text>
            <text syncTime="664.521" offset="2761435">The reason is, we submit, because of a continuing misconception of the habeas corpus process.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.095" offset="2787767">We point out that in Mr. Justice Clark's opinion, representing the unanimous consensus of the Court in Smith vs. Bennett, Court said that the choice of labels should not continue to persist as a means for suppressing constitutionally protected rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.111" offset="2867806">However, even after that decision, as we pointed out, the use of the civil label continues to persist to suppress rights which are necessary in this case to obtain meaningful appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.406" offset="2917021">Now, the counsel for the respondent here has raised some possible substitutes for a transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.454" offset="2953174">We submit that these are inadequate that they in no way give the indigent petitioner as meaningful appeal as the petitioner with funds, first of all, use of the original trial transcript, which may be available to the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.331" offset="3020675">This will not reflect claims not contained within the trial record itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.408" offset="3045021">Such things perhaps as prejudicial pre-trial or during trial publicity which may not be in the trial transcript and may be far from erasable from habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.372" offset="3088906">Such things as threats or corrosions on a defendant which will not show up in the printed pages of the record, may properly be raisable in habeas corpus and therefore, the trial transcript would not operate there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1688.203" offset="6856182">First of all, I'd like to go to the point that has been commented upon by several justices so I don't lose it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.610" offset="6885857">Did Mr. Carlson was referring to the District Court's order denying Long's petition for writ of habeas corpus insofar as that Court found that Long was represented by counsel at the preliminary hearing?</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.584" offset="6965687">I believe I am free in reading this language to have made the concession on behalf of the State because I think the language of the Court's order had self indicates that counsel wasn't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.239" offset="7024306">And if I could take the liberty on page 30 of the record and without going into the whole hearing down in the last paragraph, about middle way through, “Court further finds that as to objection no. 2 that he was denied counsel at the time of preliminary hearing, the county attorney (Inaudible) contacted the attorney for the then defendant, Patrick Lied, and said attorney advised that he would not be present and informed the county attorney that he would waive the defendant to the grand jury”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.053" offset="7183548">So, the Court's own finding shows that an attorney was not physically present in the courtroom; that the county attorney had called the attorney and he said, “Yes, I'll represent the man but I waive him to the grand jury”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.524" offset="7241435">And of course, after they got into the room where the Justice of Peace was at, the Justice of Peace accepted “plea of guilty”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.887" offset="7278947">And the Justice of Peace in the State of Iowa has no jurisdiction to accept a guilty plea in a felony case; this is why we have White vs. Maryland comparable situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2059.569" offset="8341608">Now here's what we are here talking about this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.822" offset="8354670">It's a 28-paged transcript that recorded the testimony at the habeas corpus hearing, and I'm not saying this case is moot because I ordered this transcript after certiorari was granted and it has not been made available to Lawrence Long.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.045" offset="8415587">Obviously, that's what we're here talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.254" offset="8428440">Now I've got to admit, and I'm going to admit as practical matter, that it isn't too practical to have now in retrospect spent some $3,000 or $4,000 probably to attempt to justify the denial of this $25 transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.356" offset="8500746">But be that as it may, this Court has said time and time again and so numerous that I don't mean to waive aside any cases since the Court is not concerned with whether the State is impractical but whether the State has denied this individual particularly Lawrence Long due process, equal protection by not making available to him a free copy, a copy without cause in this transcript.</text>

            <text syncTime="2193.176" offset="8876074">Simultaneously with filing this notice, the petitioner made an application to the trial court that denied the petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2207.553" offset="8933543">And that's an issue which is in the petition but what this Court denied, unaccepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.181" offset="8952142">Alright, the trial court said, “That particularly your application is denied because there is no provision of law” and I'm required to furnish him of the pre-trial transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.961" offset="9003238">Alright, so then Lawrence Long says well, “You can't do that because of this line of decisions, Griffin vs. Illinois on down true”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.966" offset="9039287">He filed then a petition or an application for certiorari in the Iowa Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.662" offset="9062066">Certiorari in the Iowa Supreme Court lies to correct illegal action on behalf of the lower tribunal.</text>
