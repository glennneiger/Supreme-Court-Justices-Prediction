            <label>Mr. Edwin J. McDermott</label>
            <text syncTime="27.859" offset="214810">Chief Justice Warren, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.099" offset="227767">This case concerns a Government supply contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.808" offset="246575">Petitioner, because of a change, requested an upward price adjustment in the contract price and upon the contracting officers' adverse decision took an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.134" offset="295894">The Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals decision was also adverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.323" offset="316688">Thereupon, petitioner brought a Tucker Act suit in the District Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.173" offset="340093">We are concerned solely with the statute of limitations which in this case bars the action unless filed within six years after the right of action first accrues.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.185" offset="392129">The District Court action was filed more than six years after the final contract delivery date although at the time involved in the administrative proceeding be excluded, the action was filed within a secured period.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.424" offset="453047">The ASPCA decision was filed six years four-and-a-half months after the final contract delivery date although the contract claim was made more than a year prior to the final contract delivery date.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.632" offset="509889">Now there are three issues involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.535" offset="517517">First is whether the contractor, while the contract administrative proceeding is pending, must bring a protective suit in order to stay the running of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.950" offset="563179">Second, is the statute extended to the date of the Board's decision so that it does not start to run until that time or that date?</text>
            <text syncTime="125.286" offset="604557">And third, is the statute tolled during the time of the contractor's claim is pending in the contract administrative proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.586" offset="641755">To change this article under which the claim arose provided for resolution of any dispute by the disputes article which in turn provided for decision by the contracting officer with appeal to the Secretary whose decision on that of his representative was final and conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.032" offset="719496">The disputes article proceeding was mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.071" offset="735692">Now, the implied contract which petitioner had was for canteen covers and it provided that the dyed felt therefore should contain a minimum amount of mildew inhibitor and be tested.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.695" offset="794102">The respondent, after testing it, rejected the felt, were not containing the required amount of inhibitor without disclosing the test that it made.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.582" offset="833703">Now the petitioners' deliveries were delayed some three months odd and its manufacturing cost increase by these rejections.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.423" offset="869021">Then the canteen covers were accepted upon the making of a downward price adjustment similarly under the changes article.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.522" offset="897442">Now much later but well within the six-year period after final delivery, the petitioner discovered that the respondent had rejected the dyed felt by the use of a colorimetric test which was not provided by the contract and which we contend was not accurate as the dyed felt.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.363" offset="976854">Now the petitioner requested the contracting officer to make an equitable upward price adjustment and from his denial took an appeal and upon the adverse decision the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals brought this Tucker Act suit in the District Court for the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.119" offset="1051878">Now the District Court dismissed the suit on the ground that it was barred by the statute of limitations ruling that the statutes started to run on the date of the final contract deliveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.154" offset="1095973">Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and that Court on the division affirmed the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.410" offset="1132962">Now, the three issues involved as I said are staying, extending or tolling the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.124" offset="1163891">Now, this urge to their protective suit must be instituted to stay the running of the statute while the administrative remedy is being pursued.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.015" offset="1203388">If the protective suit be the rule and many lawyers would advise their clients to file actions in the District Courts or in the Court of Claims at the time that the administrative proceeding under the disputes article has instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.818" offset="1262634">Now the defendant -- now the respondent in his brief has referred to an article by Mr. Spector, the Chairman on Board of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.923" offset="1307042">That's on page 34, the respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.613" offset="1321775">Now on page 284, Mr. Spector's article has noted there are 11,856 appeals redacted by the ASPCA and the predecessors and that only 467 were filed in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.789" offset="1390529">Now had the rule of protective suit been required then instead of 467 suits, it might have been 11,856 suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.366" offset="1432848">Now we submit that the dockets of the Courts are too crowded for Congress to have intended that suit must be brought by the contracting officer and the Board of Appeals are engaged in ascertaining the facts which will determine whether the Government will pay the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.834" offset="1506722">Now many worthy claims wouldn't be defeated in the cases of claimants unaware of the need for bringing such effective actions and many courts wouldn't dismiss a protective suit as premature and probably any Assistant United States' Attorney would so urge.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.607" offset="1573804">So we submit that a protective suit is not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.091" offset="1587702">The next we submit that a -- the statute is extended by the contract disputes article and proceeding does not begin to run until the final administrative decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.613" offset="1633782">I might say that after the Court of Appeals' decision was rendered in this case which was in June of 1966 and the Court of Claims rendered a Nager Electric decision in October 1966 which is reported at 368 F.2d 847 and that's Mr. Judge -- Judge Davis' opinion and which supports this point of our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.949" offset="1771186">A contractor's claim for equitable price adjustment comes within the disputes article since it is compensable under the changes article and the contractor may not bring a Tucker Act suit until he has exhausted the administrative remedies provided by the contract and should he sue without exhausting such remedies is suitably dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.628" offset="1865853">Now under the Wunderlich Act of 9/11/1954, no suit can be instituted unless the contractor can say that the final administrative decision is subject to judicial reversal because it's arbitrary, it's capricious, fraudulent, in bad faith, not supported by substantial evidence or erroneous in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.956" offset="1951222">Now it cannot in this suit of any of those things until the administrative decision is rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.476" offset="1977240">He must secure the decision before he can attack it.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.220" offset="1992286">And the District Courts and the Court of Claims are limited to a review of the administrative record and may not take evidence de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.793" offset="2022588">Now in any matter, required to be submitted to the Board of Appeals, a contractor has bound himself to the administrative course and he has agreed to convert a breach of contract claim to one of relief under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.789" offset="2082565">The claims under the changes, Changed Conditions or Delays-Damages articles, the contractor must file a claim with the contracting officer and that the decision being adverse, he must appeal to the Board of Appeals then he can't ask the United States to pay any amounts on account of his claim until the Board of Appeals files a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.666" offset="2166053">He can't sue in Court until he has a right to demand payment.We submit that that is when the right of action first accrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.044" offset="2195519">Now limitation statutes aren't designed to promote justice by preventing surprise and revival of claims but have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost or memories have faded and witnesses have disappeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.516" offset="2249435">Now in contract administrative proceedings, cases claims are promptly made, evidence is presented, memories are threshed and witnesses appear and testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.415" offset="2293008">The reason for the statute of limitations we submit is not present in these cases.Now in the United States Steel decision of the Court of Claims which is cited by the respondent on page 21 of its brief, Judge Davis writing for the Court of Claims said that the delay, the 1946 to 1958 in the Board proceeding there, that there is no claim or reason to believe that the Government evidence or records which would have been introduced before the Board were lost, destroyed, unavailable or grew stale.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.238" offset="2428322">Judge Davis said that the record did not show the reasons for the delay or who was at fault, that the parties attempted to cast the blame on each other but that the Court could not tell which side was right and that in any event, the Court felt that the Government was in no position to complain of delay since it had allowed the proceedings to remain dormant for over 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.330" offset="2528737">Now there's no inherent delay in contract administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.013" offset="2551411">As it was noted in the Court's Utah Construction Company decision, there are built-in limitations on claims under the contract.Changes article has 10 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.577" offset="2601671">Changed Conditions clause, immediate notification.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.113" offset="2615777">The Delays-Damages clause, 10 days and there's only the contracting officer who can raise those time limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.913" offset="2647019">The contractor cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.103" offset="2655796">Now with respect to manners which are properly pursued with the disputes proceeding which has lasted beyond contract completion --</text>

            <text syncTime="1369.110" offset="5579839">It's our position of course that the cause of action does accrue when the breach of the contractual duty occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="1433.126" offset="5835839">The laboratory tests were conducted in October -- of November 1956 and November -- from November 8th to December 4th, four change orders were entered into reducing the price of the canteen covers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1531.449" offset="6229138">In considering the various views, I would like to note at the outset something that's common to both our positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.649" offset="6254007">We think it's only our view that is that cause accrues at the time of the breach of duty and that it's not tolled, it's only this view that provides incentives for prompt and diligent prosecution of the claims by Government contractors on this kind of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.178" offset="6320044">Either of the other two views would require the Government to defend at least in some circumstances staled claims in which memories had become dim and records lost and witnesses disappeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.855" offset="6374797">Whereas this Court held in the Utah Construction case last term, these contract cases involved not only claims arising under the contract which are within the ambit of the disputes clause but also the so-called Breach Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.494" offset="6433311">And one of the typical and perhaps the classical type of breach claim -- claim is the so-called Delay Claim and that is something that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.323" offset="6468629">This contract is asking not only for an equitable adjustment but it's also asking for damages due to the delay and while this point was not articulated particularly in the courts below, it strikes me as being sort of the classical kind of delay claim in which the contract would be entitled to trial de novo in the District Court or in the Court of Claims where -- where he brought the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.164" offset="6567999">And so you would have as the results here if you took either of the other two positions, cases in the late suit being filed are tried in the late 1960s in regard to claims that -- actually facts that actually occurred in -- in 1956 and we don't think this is what Congress intended and we don't think that that's what this Court should hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.657" offset="6662040">I'd like to address myself first to the accrual point which counsel has addressed himself to primarily and then to the tolling point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.142" offset="6703940">It's our position that the cause of action accrues as Mr. Justice Douglas indicated in the Unexcelled Chemical Corporation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.982" offset="6747303">When the breach of duty occurs, not when that breach is -- is discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.946" offset="6779173">Here, and this is a -- a sort of a typical case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.862" offset="6802787">We have performance in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.030" offset="6815535">The breach occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.061" offset="6823581">We think the alleged breach when the laboratory test were made which was October and November 1956 and certainly no later than after that was arranged by a change order can affect compromise, certainly no later than the goods were delivered and the work was performed so that the payment was due.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.763" offset="6910412">The opposing position is that the cause of action doesn't accrue until after the final administrative determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1851.383" offset="7508929">Let me point out that this is a very, very rare animal that we have here, this -- this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.606" offset="7541844">We have looked for a Tucker Act suit in which the statute of limitations was urged, which the administrative determination was not made within the six years and we have found none at the appellate level until this very case that is in all of the thousands and thousands of Government contracts that we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.600" offset="7625749">This case is the very first one involving the six-year Tucker Act statute of limitations in which the administrative proceedings have not been terminated within the six-year period and the reason for that, I think is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.997" offset="7679352">We've indicated in our briefs in the Utah case and the Grace case last year and we've repeated again this year, the average time before decisions is roughly 11 months and the result is that contractors -- certainly those who wish to do so are -- are almost without exception, able to get the claim heard and decided very, very promptly after it's been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.251" offset="7776423">So this is a very unusual situation and we think, the facts of this case explain why it's come up this way, the facts of this case indicated the claim wasn't filed administratively until almost five years so that most of the six-year period was used up before the claim was filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2243.962" offset="9079202">That's confirmed by the fact -- by the Court's recent decision in Utah that these suits involved breach claims as well as claims that are covered by the disputes clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.619" offset="9117863">So that this is -- if this was a suit for simply -- for review of the administrative decision, Congress would probably have provided a 60 or 90-day period of -- of statute of limitations but that's not what it's done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.160" offset="9171989">It's provided the six-year, the conditional contract, statute of limitations and this six-year period example to encompass all the administrative proceedings and the overwhelming majority cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2291.096" offset="9267806">The McMahon case, there was a statutory requirement, the exhaustion of remedies and this Court nevertheless held that the cause of action accrued when the breach occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.320" offset="9312632">That was the tort type duty that was in the seaman's claim for unseaworthiness and negligence and the Court held notwithstanding the -- notwithstanding the fact that the statute required exhaustion of administrative remedies, the cause of action accrued at the time of the breach of duty and we think the same as true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.772" offset="9386506">And Unexcelled Chemical was the Government's suit on behalf of underpaid employees under the Walsh-Healey Act and there too, the Court held that the cause of action was created when the breach of duty occurred and there too Your Honor, the exhaustion was a prerequisite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.357" offset="9460799">Now Judge Davis says that it wasn't, but the statute there requires the Secretary of Labor to hold the hearing and forbids them from recovering on it unless there's been an administrative hearing, and that's the stronger case for holding the cause of action didn't accrue because there, the suit is only on the administrative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.008" offset="9547421">In here, we have both this -- the part of the suit that's on the administrative record and the part that involves the breach claims.</text>
