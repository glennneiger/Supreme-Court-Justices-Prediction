            <text syncTime="9.555" offset="141563">Mr. Legg.</text>

            <label>Mr. Reagan H. Legg</label>
            <text syncTime="10.844" offset="146787">Mr. Chief Justice, associate Justices, and if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.768" offset="166431">This is a case where the petitioner was convicted by jury for the offense of murder in a Texas trial court and assessed to punishment of 25 years in the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.505" offset="213347">That conviction was affirmed by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and we're here on writ of certiorari granted to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.105" offset="267786">The case concerns, principally of course, the admission into evidence of what was the denominated state's Exhibit 13 which is found on page 428 of the record which was the third in a series of confessions which petitioner had signed while in custody of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.114" offset="363813">The central issue I think in the case evolves down to whether or not assuming, as I think we may at least, that the first two confessions here were involuntary, that they were coerced that they were given at the time when as the decisions of this Court have said, the petitioner's will were overwhelming, that assuming that to be the case then what is required in order to purify the effects of that coercion so that a person might freely and voluntarily make a subsequent confession concerning the same things.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.359" offset="540818">Now, there was in this case of course a petitioner to briefly summarize, had never been in trouble before, he was arrested without a warrant after he had voluntarily come to the city of Midland in response to a request communicated to his sister by the sheriff's office that they would like to talk to him about some bones which had been uncovered some two miles northwest of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.352" offset="660773">He left immediately and came directly to the sheriff's office on Saturday night where he was questioned for about two hours and told to go home and to return the following morning about 8:30 or 9:00 am to talk to the sheriff.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.480" offset="721272">He did go, but about 6 o'clock the next morning, a city police officer who had not participated in the investigation of the case and he testified that he knew very little about the case went to the place where the petitioner was and woke him up at 6 o'clock and told him to come on and go with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.440" offset="797132">He took him then to the city jail where the interrogation process began.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>

            <label>Mr. Reagan H. Legg</label>
            <text syncTime="181.000" offset="827329">Yes sir, that was an arrest and I believe that the officer concedes Mr. Justice White that it was an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.329" offset="860662">He was asked the question incidentally at the trial why didn't procure a warrant for the arrest of the petitioner and he testified on page 170 and 171 of the record that he knew that he did not have grounds sufficient to obtain a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.909" offset="939029">He did testify of course that he took his belongings from him and put him up which meant that he locked him in the cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.640" offset="965883">Now, that police officer, the witness Morales testified to questioning the petitioner at least six hours during Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.744" offset="998379">The petitioner said that it consisted of -- it was a lot more time in the night that he was questioned almost all day.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.539" offset="1033488">The police officers also admitted to interrogating him at night, but said they did not question him after midnight.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.789" offset="1062536">The petitioner had claimed that he was questioned until about 3 am on Monday morning.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="244.964" offset="1083225">Then may I ask if one of your position is then that this having been an illegal arrest not on probable cause at the time, everything after that is moot and that that ground alone inadmissible?</text>

            <label>Mr. Reagan H. Legg</label>
            <text syncTime="257.451" offset="1133171">Yes Mr. Justice Brennan, that is one of our positions on this appeal that the arrest being illegal and it being a fragment, disavowed all of the police officer of the -- of the law as they existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.364" offset="1196805">Because on the Texas law is I think we point that in our briefs where we cited the statutes, there was no cause for arresting him which would excuse rather an arrest without a warrant here.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.124" offset="1243826">As to the third confession are you going to have a problem of attenuation of chain of events?</text>

            <label>Mr. Reagan H. Legg</label>
            <text syncTime="292.646" offset="1273919">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.651" offset="1277994">I believe that this is what it comes down to.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.252" offset="1296384">The -- and in order to get to that sir, I think that the contention here on the part of the state is that despite the coercion which I think in effect be admitted concerning the first two statements that because three days then passed in which both the petitioner and the state admit that the only or the principal certainly coercive circumstance was his confinement in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.161" offset="1412054">I think that their contention is that that had been attenuated.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>

            <label>Mr. Reagan H. Legg</label>
            <text syncTime="336.234" offset="1448312">No sir, he was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.914" offset="1455000">There's testimony in the record Mr. Chief Justice by the deputy sheriff who testified that he was not seen by counsel and to their knowledge he had no counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.640" offset="1505886">The three days of course is the question I think which we're presented with in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.194" offset="1532113">We have a question I think Mr. Justice Brennan of attenuation not only of the illegal arrest but of course also of the coercive conducts of the police officers during that -- during the previous facts.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="368.240" stopTime="369.958">

            <label>Mr. Reagan H. Legg</label>
            <text syncTime="369.958" offset="1583208">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.435" offset="1593135">I've attempted to create these two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.435" offset="1605151">I believe it is and that's the way it has been presented of course to the Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.749" offset="1626363">But certainly it is a part of the totality of the circumstances if not an independent ground that they say.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.459" offset="1665233">The petitioner of course has testified and it is in the case that “I didn't figure out, I had no choice,” I believe, this is a colored man who couldn't get through the fifth grade in school who however, had been reasonably responsible and held a reasonably responsible position and had never been in trouble with the law before.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.244" offset="1768364">On Tuesday then, he was, we're not going into the circumstances and the facts which I think we detailed greatly in the brief, a fact that he wasn't fed for a period of two days prior to his first confession or he didn't have anything to eat.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.350" offset="1832730">The fact that the newspaper had reported the reporter testified that the office -- that the officers had told him that the petitioner said just prior to signing the first confession or making the first confession, if you'll just bring me some milk I'll give you whatever confession you want and sign it.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.647" offset="1905977">The fact that he didn't have adequate sleep or rest during that period of the time and of course he says that he was beaten, he was cursed and he was threatened and abused otherwise by the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.554" offset="1957595">He was taken to the grave where they told him they had dug up these bones of what was believed to be his wife who had disappeared some six months prior to this attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.978" offset="2015274">He was not taken before a magistrate of course until 38 hours after his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.706" offset="2038157">He was not advised according to the record of his right to counsel before the first two confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.605" offset="2061772">There is no or any oral confession which he has testified to here in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.279" offset="2088521">There is no evidence whatever that he was advised to his right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.824" offset="2118719">On Tuesday morning then after having been delivered to the sheriff on Friday and making no complaint about being mistreated by the officers during that interim from late Friday afternoon to early Tuesday morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.614" offset="2173785">He was brought down the Sheriff's office about 9:30 in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.298" offset="2192593">He again denied as the record shows he had done repeatedly during the previous questioning, he again denied any implication in this case or in the knowledge of his wife's death and he repeated to the sheriff's officers the fact that he had been mistreated by the officers during the other interrogations at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.242" offset="2280364">They did mention to him that they might want him to take some more lie detector test, since he had been subjected to seven of those during the previous interrogations.</text>

            <text syncTime="575.720" offset="2406275">The -- he was confined during that interrogation in jail and the city jail in Midland, Texas in the Department of Public Safety Jail which was outside the city limits of that city and was confined in a jail in Borger, Texas, 300 miles away where has was taken during the first five days of interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.454" offset="2513168">On Tuesday morning as I mentioned he was brought down at 9:30 by two deputy sheriffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.482" offset="2533334">He again denied his guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.416" offset="2545037">They mentioned to him that he might be subjected or would he be interested in taking some more polygraph tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.655" offset="2570010">He did then say that he would like to talk to somebody before talking -- going any further with them and they asked him who and he said he like to talk to his boss, and they went to the phone and came back and said there was no answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.649" offset="2642004">The deputy sheriffs then bought then the district attorney who talked to him and thereafter he did orally confess then the confession he was later reduced to writing, I think all of the procedure there prior to the ten that the old confession was about an hour and 15 minutes according to the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.544" offset="2725595">His testimony was when asked about this third confession, they went and got Mr. Mends and when they went and got him, “well I was scared because I could see it looked like the same thing happening all over again, that three or four days of abusing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="669.718" offset="2782229">This is at page 153 of the record, “and I was scared and I didn't think I could take that no more, and so I just went on and gave them the statement because I had already made two statements and I didn't figure it made any difference and I had signed two.”</text>
            <text syncTime="686.985" offset="2851297">Certainly, the position of petitioner here is that the taint had not been attenuated.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.074" offset="2895705">Once a man is broken in and the opinions of this Court, the decisions of this Court in many instances have referred to the fact that when a man is broken in or when he is subjected to tactics reminiscing of the imposition that has happened in many cases that certainly it takes a long time to repair the damages done that I think that the decisions of this Court would certainly support our contention that once a man has been broken that he's no longer a whole man and that considering the type of coercive tactics that are employed against him that it would take him certainly more than three days to recover from the effects of that treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="779.778" offset="3222444">That's shown in the record from the testimony of the various officers that they were trying to get him to tell the truth, that they told him he ought to make a statement and things like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.053" offset="3283571">I think that it is conceded certainly by the state and by the testimony of their officers that this was the purpose of the interrogation and of all the tactics employed by the police during the course of it was to get a confession.</text>

            <text syncTime="849.583" offset="3501746">The others were brought into evidence by the petitioner for a simple reason that it was necessary to do so in order to try to demonstrate the inconsistency of those statements.</text>

            <text syncTime="1821.086" offset="7387721">Now, admittedly when the third confession was given, the petitioner had visitors in the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.419" offset="7433070">He had talked to his sister-in-law, to his -- I mean his mother-in-law and two other ladies and Mrs. Johnson and some other ladies, he had talked in private with an attorney, a fellow by the name of H. S. Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.970" offset="7495241">Now, he came to visit him in the jailhouse, according to the testimony of one of the officers on Thursday morning before he gave the second confession and the testimony is from his own mouth that he conferred with him in private.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.130" offset="7555845">Now, we don't know what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.972" offset="7563264">If we did, it would be in violation of his rights so we cannot argue that that lawyer had informed him of his rights, but we must be allowed to assume that they must have talked about the case and secondly, the only evidence in the record that the man was coerced, it was his own testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="1898.324" offset="7696697">All of it is in dispute except made for the times that he was taken from the jail to Borger where the truck, pound truck he was driving in was searched that was admitted, the fact that he was taken out to the grave, now that was admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.777" offset="7758451">The fact that he was questioned, that's admitted, but the fact that he says that he was questioned past midnight with all of those three officers who testified the trial where they were in charge of the keys to the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.096" offset="7799724">They were in jail, so they didn't allow anybody in or out of the cell past midnight for this conflicting testimony in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.582" offset="7825742">Now, there's also -- he claims that he was taken to a border 300 miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.850" offset="7846745">The record shows that, at page 135 or 134 that he voluntarily consented to have the search on the truck maker and the voluntary statement that he signed allowing the search of the truck was offered in try -- at the trial state's exhibit number 10, and that was admitted without any single objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.877" offset="7954892">So the reason that he went to the Borger was because he had consented to the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.569" offset="7969625">Now, in Borger he talked to his brother-in-law there and he -- a fellow by name of Malone, this the officer testified to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.254" offset="8004420">Now, he says that the petitioner testified that he was abused back in Borger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.153" offset="8039946">The officer of course denied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.655" offset="8049977">Here we have a situation where the testimony is really overwhelming on the side of the police officers from the assistant chief of the police who picked him up on Thursday morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.587" offset="8113716">He says he talked to him, he asked him if he had been abused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.884" offset="8122911">He said “No, he hadn't been abused.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.504" offset="8129390">This was after he had given his second confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.485" offset="8141302">So the testimony is really in a mess as far as, as whether or not he was or wasn't, we got the testimony both ways.</text>

            <text syncTime="2636.439" offset="10649161">But he had had an opportunity to consult with an attorney in private.</text>

            <text syncTime="2645.050" offset="10683538">As a matter of fact that day that he says he don't have anything to eat, on Sunday, his own mother-in-law brought him some soup to the jail because he wanted some special -- he had an ulcer, that's what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.393" offset="10736933">And he was offered that soup, now they testified to that and he says he didn't want any.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.836" offset="10762742">He was offered -- the record was just full of occasions when he was offered food.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.355" offset="10776743">Now there's testimony they saw him out of the Department of Public Safety smoking a cigar, drinking a coke.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.862" offset="10802866">There were occasions when they stopped by the road to buy him some milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.355" offset="10816763">They brought him some soup to the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.753" offset="10822405">There's testimony on that that they warmed it up for him because he gotten back a little late.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.295" offset="10840586">He ate it, he drank it there, I mean, the soup.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.763" offset="10858454">He was allowed to use the phone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.966" offset="10863261">And the only time he says he wasn't allowed to use the phone was Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.805" offset="10878621">He says he wasn't allowed to call his sister.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.417" offset="10889070">That he said this upset him because he wanted to talk to his sister before she came to visit him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.500" offset="10905370">So he wasn't held incommunicado.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.007" offset="10919372">So I think that it's our position that assuming for the sake of argument that those are the two confessions were illegal, because we do have an illegal arrest but I don't see any connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.457" offset="10961168">As far as our state is concerned it's not the illegal arrest but the illegal detention that would vitiate a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.276" offset="10992515">And I don't know of any cases that would this Court has handed down which says an illegal arrest ipso facto remove any voluntary -- voluntariness to the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.851" offset="11058761">So that was the position that the first two confession were really --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="2741.652" offset="11069942">Well I suppose it could bear on it though, couldn't it, if they arrest him without any legal cause and held them there for two or three days until a -- three or fours days until they got the confession they wanted to use against him in the court, but would you think that could bear upon whether it was voluntary or not?</text>

            <text syncTime="2761.594" offset="11149772">That would be a question for the -- a question that would go directly into the voluntariness of the confession, but here -- and it would be something to argue to the court and have the jury pass upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.174" offset="11200031">In this case the jury heard all this evidence and the court heard all this evidence by itself for a matter of one day, testimony on the confessions and the court resolved this issue against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.521" offset="11245484">The jury heard it and they resolve it against him too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.327" offset="11256665">And of course the Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction saying that there was -- that the court had resolved it and they took the confessions voluntary also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.567" offset="11289684">So at the most we have a situation where they -- the facts surrounding the first two confessions is completely muddled because I really can't make too much sense of the record as it appears there's contradiction from both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.347" offset="11340779">He says he was questioned on Tuesday, all the officers testified that on that day they never saw him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.288" offset="11368573">Also Morales was off that day, he didn't even work that day and he says that he was questioned by officer Morales on Tuesday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.751" offset="11390412">So unless there weren't any questions that's all we have.</text>

            <text syncTime="2834.533" offset="11441507">I believe that the record does show beyond the question that this petitioner was questioned on Tuesday not for any great length of time according to the testimony of the officers at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.747" offset="11498350">But they do admit the questioning him on two occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.509" offset="11509426">He says that he was questioned on Tuesday and on Tuesday night.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.276" offset="11524472">And on Wednesday then he was taking on this 300-mile round trip.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.002" offset="11539414">Along, I mean in connection with this idea foods which has been discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.521" offset="11565432">I think if -- he was offered food they say, the officers say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.018" offset="11583404">He denies that he was offered any food at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.288" offset="11596570">His sister substantiates at least that he was not offered any food on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.996" offset="11615378">But certainly on the days that were important to the confessions that is Sunday and Monday and Wednesday and Thursday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.770" offset="11646412">He didn't eat anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.376" offset="11656861">He didn't have anything to eat except from Sunday morning to Monday night, one coca cola, on Wednesday when they took him to Borger, one cartoon of milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.145" offset="11703986">On Thursday, nothing all day long, now these were the times which of course are pertinent and of course the first two confessions were concerned.</text>
