            <label>Mr. Arlo E. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="12.728" offset="154311">Mr. Chief Justice, it -- may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.581" offset="169671">Yesterday, we left on the note of why do we look at the entire record.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.149" offset="196002">Under any test regardless of how it is defined it's a question of judgment, its judgmental, as just -- Justice Rutledge said in the Koteakos case, you must examine the entire proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.307" offset="244590">This case said is Fahy versus Connecticut, you must examine the impact of that error not examine the error alone but the impact of that error upon the entire case to see whether or not it -- in that test, was reasonably possible that it contributed to the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.797" offset="322539">Doesn't matter how you word it, that's another problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.910" offset="334973">That case, there was illegally obtained evidence introduced, the paint in the brushes.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.562" offset="357648">The Court pointed out there that this had a serious impact of the -- the brush marks were identified as being identical with that paint -- painted the swastika.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.933" offset="399130">The paint and the bucket were found in the car which was seen near the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.387" offset="420968">The court pointed out that in fact the confrontation of this illegal evidence probably led to the confession that was introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.811" offset="446568">It pointed to the impact of that testimony upon the defense concluding that it probably brought about the presentation of the defendant, putting the defendant on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.075" offset="491708">Now what is the impact of a comment hereupon this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="102.355" offset="512815">I suggest to you that there is none when you examine the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.254" offset="536430">It had none of these factors that the court pointed to in Fahy.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.230" offset="556283">What happened in this case was a robbery, murder and kidnapping of a bartender in Lodi.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.248" offset="588361">The evidence although the petitioners contend that there was no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.246" offset="608319">There were three or four exhibits not introduced but the story is a very simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.918" offset="627022">There was conspiracy between Mrs. Chapman and Mr. Teale.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.548" offset="645517">They were seeing together for a period of -- they lived together for a period, they left a city in California on October 10, they went to Reno.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.750" offset="678327">There she purchased a -- which turned out later to be a very peculiar 22 automatic, and a 32.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.515" offset="709465">Thereafter they were registered jointly in a motel in Fresno not 100 miles below the scene of the crime, the very day before the robbery, kidnapping and murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.222" offset="764217">He signed the registration, she signed would turned out to be a bad check.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.911" offset="783026">They were identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.056" offset="787623">There was expert testimony all the way through as to the signatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.188" offset="804133">Thereafter that evening, they were seen in a bar called -- bar and restaurant called Croce's in City of Lodi.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.580" offset="833703">They were there from about ten until shortly after one o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.297" offset="844570">There were various things that occurred there, there was a lot of discussions but they were positively identified there.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.340" offset="868707">They were positively established that they were driving the same 61 Ford that's -- goes throughout the proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="249.921" offset="1103078">We're talking about words but essentially it's judgmental.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.503" offset="1125334">They went into the -- they left this bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.190" offset="1136097">Mrs. Chapman said, “We can't do anything in here, let's go.”</text>
            <text syncTime="262.914" offset="1155009">Few minutes later they entered the bar of the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.778" offset="1170474">They are positively identified in that bar, both of these people that witnesses point out that in fact they were the last people in that bar when the bar closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.132" offset="1219897">A driver who had been -- knew the bartender driving a truck late at night saw and identified that bartender locking the door, saw a man and a woman meeting the description of the defendants here near -- one of them immediately behind him and the other one nearer.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.272" offset="1288443">Thereafter the next morning in the County of Sacramento, a short distance away, a body was found, the body of the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.791" offset="1318536">He's been robbed, his wallet, its contents thrown around and underneath the body is -- found a check, says, “Refer to maker”, signed by Mrs. Chapman.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.729" offset="1366288">And the time of death as established by the coroner and the experts to be three o'clock, the shooting about two thirty.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.350" offset="1408815">This witness -- the defendants here then show up in Davis, four thirty of that very morning and register under the false of Kiel Rosenthal, giving a false license plate which the court corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.907" offset="1470986">Thereafter they fled the State of California, went to Missouri and went to Louisiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="2317.613" offset="9373863">When the first opinion came down, the Court -- the California Court apparently was not aware of the fact that there had been this comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.514" offset="9409390">On page 55 of my brief the court's opinion, first opinion is set forth as stated, neither defendant testified in his or her own behalf in the exercise of their constitutional privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.490" offset="9469367">This failure to testify was not commented upon by the prosecuting attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.726" offset="9490265">But the court in instructions to the jury and in accordance with the California constitutional provision stated among other things that the failure of defendants to testify from facts within their knowledge and explanation of incriminating evidence maybe deemed as tending to indicate the truth of such incriminating evidence and that among the inferences that may reasonably -- maybe reasonably drawn there from, those unfavorable to the defendant are the more probable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.552" offset="9609592">Now, immediately there was a petition for rehearing file calling attention to the court that they had overlooked all these comments which I have called Your Honor's attention in my brief from pages 92 until the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.402" offset="9664972">So they then adopted and -- a modifying opinion in which they acknowledged that they were wrong and set forth that there were a number of arguments made as to the failure of the defendants to take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.112" offset="9727770">In fact it covers two, almost two printed pages and then they go on to say the foregoing comments and instruction have been ruled in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, Griffin versus California, Malloy versus Hogan --</text>

            <text syncTime="2594.384" offset="10480933">Well, that is right but you -- but I still -- but you asked me if any constitutional error per se becomes automatically a harmful error and I say that it does because it's of constitutional magnitude and because the framers of our Constitution insisted in the formation of the Bill of Rights that the Bill of Rights be passed before they would agree to the passing of the Constitution and nine states in this country voted for the Bill of Rights because -- and the Constitution was passed only because the Bill of Rights was there to protect the people in those fundamental rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.023" offset="10643414">Now, what are those fundamental rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.964" offset="10655222">The Fourth Amendment, unlawful search and seizure which Your Honor has in the next case, the Fifth Amendment, self incrimination, the denial of counsel, illegally securing confession; the Sixth Amendment, denial of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.688" offset="10714154">Can we name any right that is guaranteed by the consti -- Bill of Rights that it is now of fundamental error, that it is now of such magnitude that the mere failure to observe it is of such an error as requires its recognition and that any rule that says of it as harmless tries to limit the provisions of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.244" offset="10808299">Now, if Your Honors please, summing up in this case, it is my position that the State of California has conceded that error was committed in this case by the numerous comments and they have conceded that it violated, as the Griffin rule and the Malloy versus the Hogan rule exists today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.600" offset="10929821">They would turn the faucet on and off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.471" offset="10945285">They say it was harmless yesterday but it's harmful today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.358" offset="10960854">Well, such a view cannot be taken of fundamental error such as an existence here nor all these pages as I have set forth in from page 92 on in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.590" offset="11013726">Now, there is a little comment that was made in an opinion written here sometime back in Miller versus the Territory of Oklahoma which was adopted by our Court and People versus Glass, the seal unrestrained by legal barriers of some prosecuting attorneys tempts to an insistence upon the admission of incompetent evidence or getting before the jury some extraneous facts suppose to be helpful in securing a verdict of guilty where they have prestige enough to induce the trial court to give them latitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.068" offset="11155623">When the error is exposed on appeal, it is about whether stereotype argument that is not apparent and anywise that it in anywise influence the minds of the jury just as Your Honor Chief Justice pointed out in arguing with the attorney general here in comment to the attorney general.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.309" offset="11228557">The reply the law makes to such suggestion is that after injecting it into the case to influence the jury, the prosecutor ought not to be heard to say after he has secured the conviction it was harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.596" offset="11289788">As the appellate court has done inside in -- to the deliberation of the jury room, the presumption is to be indulged in favor of the liberty of the citizen that whatever the prosecutor against the protest of the defendant as laid before the jury help to make up the way of the prosecution which resulted in the verdict of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.847" offset="11366797">Your Honors will find that on page 6 of my closing brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.257" offset="11384351">It's adopted in People versus Miranda and again this Court in its early case of Bram versus U.S. also have the language that is quite similar that the court cannot say after it has come in that it is harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.084" offset="11471705">The prosecutor used it to bring a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.948" offset="11483199">He used it to lead the jury to infer the guilt of these defendants and on top of inferring to the guilt of these defendants that the court instructed the jury in language that told them they could do that respectfully.</text>
