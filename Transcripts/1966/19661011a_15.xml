            <label>Mr. William J. O'Brien, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="32.918" offset="235081">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.518" offset="253471">This case concerns the validity of reports and orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission granting authority to six railroads whom I represent to extend their lines and operations to serve the facilities of the principal customers and shippers of the Rock Island Railroad at Lake Calumet Harbor in Chicago, Illinois which customers and shippers I also represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.413" offset="357021">The case presents two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.647" offset="366007">I shall treat with the primary issue as to whether or not there was substantial support in the evidence to the findings and conclusions of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.559" offset="397563">And Mr. Posner, the Department of Justice will treat with the issue as to whether or not the Rock Island was denied due process of law when the Commission refused to grant further hearings in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.493" offset="449390">At the outset let me say that this is not a merely confined to the Rock Island and the six railroads but it is a case of the six railroads wishing to serve the port and the principal shippers at Lake Calumet wanting these railroads to serve the port on a one side and the Rock Island, the sole railroad serving the port on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.864" offset="534862">A statutory three-judge District Court in Cleveland, Ohio, as one judge dissenting held it was not ample support in the record for the conclusions of the Commission and they should injunction permanently restraining the Commission from putting its orders into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.852" offset="602781">At the same time the court found there is substantial support in the evidence with the major findings of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.959" offset="631202">And these findings Your Honors, we respectfully submit in adopting themselves would justify the granting of a certificate by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.490" offset="669341">Appellants, applicants before the Commission and intervening shippers seek to have this injunction dissolved in order that the observers proposed which the Commission found to be required in the future public convenience necessity might be initiated and accelerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.131" offset="747917">Contrary to the intent of Congress, the District Courts and the Rock Island would write out from Section 1, Paragraph 18 of the Interstate Commerce Act, the word “future”.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.782" offset="798490">That Act in substance through that portion in the Act in substance provides that, “no railroad shall extend its lines or its operations until it asked first obtain from Interstate Commerce Commission a certificate of the present or future public convenience and the necessity requires or will require such construction and/or operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.599" offset="889814">In the light of the evidence submitted by shippers, Court and Public Officials in the light of the findings of the commission themselves not be -- the Court including the dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.977" offset="943313">It's difficult to understand the opinion and order of the District Court which is carefully inconsistent and contradictory.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.515" offset="977481">When the applications were filed with the Commission approximately 10 years ago, the appellants sought to prove and did so to force the examiners satisfaction and later the Commission satisfaction that the service proposed by the railroads would aide in the development of the Court, at port, excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.125" offset="1055848">The Commission found and the courts said, there were substantial support in the record to the finding that Lake Calumet Harbor is located and one of the heaviest industrial areas in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.685" offset="1102137">That presents one of the greatest potentials for the generating of traffic in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.976" offset="1123244">That is the major port of the Port of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.887" offset="1134947">The major deep water port of the Port of Chicago and it is located in Chicago as the heart of Chicago's railroad switching district.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.610" offset="1173817">The Port of Chicago was then the major Great Lake's general cargo port and in 1959 was to become a dominant gateway for export grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.412" offset="1221047">This property is publicly owned and as leased to individual operators by the Chicago Regional Port District, individual operators like appellants here.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.736" offset="1262320">At the time of the hearing, over $24 million have been spent on the initial development of Lake Calumet Harbor including the construction of grain elevators, public warehouses, cold storage plants, transit sheds, trucking terminals, and 14 miles of railroad tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.130" offset="1347897">Additional basic findings for which the Court held over substantial support in the record where the following that the great – the lakes to Gulf Waterway completed 1933 is St. Lawrence Seaway which would be completed in 1959 and the Calumet Sag Channel nearing completion would make the port one of the busiest in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.772" offset="1438490">Its facilities have unparalleled access to barge, lake steamer, and motor transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.938" offset="1467120">And what the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway would have complete access to ocean transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.420" offset="1493034">It is however served by one railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.489" offset="1509334">With the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway beside there'll be an appreciable increase in the size and the capacity of the ships serving the Great Lakes overseas transportation, stated more briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.707" offset="1562206">The size and carrying capacity, the ships would be doubled in order to permit a greater percentage of the world's merchant train to reach the Port of Chicago each season.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.359" offset="1608808">The Commission found and the Court had a substantial support in the record for defining that an efficient economic transportation of cargo between land carrier and water carrier would necessitate it's substantially broaden -- substantially broaden railroad service into a notably Calumet Harbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.706" offset="1686235">And that prompt efficient service in the field of international transportation was mandatory and that it was necessary for any port dealing in Interocean freight to have supporting facilities nearby and that the And that the applicants had rail yards in close proximity to the port equal to 12 times at presently available through the Rock Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.981" offset="1787277">Applicants would be in a position to make direct deliveries and expedite shipments as the case demanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.067" offset="1815594">Their operation would be cheaper because of its -- and careless handling.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.738" offset="1834297">Regarding future traffic, but what the Commission found and the Court against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.498" offset="1853315">There was substantial support in the record for the finding that base of the testimony of representatives of the appellants here and the port and public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.635" offset="1889886">There would be amount material increase in future tonnage that the present facilities of the port would not be reached to capacity for several years that large additions were planned for earlier construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.491" offset="1945370">In other words, imperative to the future success of the port that a plan system for handling the transportation needs be established in order to ensure a service which would provide for steady growth and expansion.</text>

            <text syncTime="498.003" offset="2095417">In addition the testimony of the manager of the Chicago Regional Port Districts, are representatives of the shippers and receivers not located -- not only at the port but also in the -- say distributor thereto are the representative of the Chicago Association of Commerce and Industry of the Chicago Board of Trade and U.S. Department of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.999" offset="2191339">Our testimony disclosed and the Commission found that the competitive rail service here offered by the applicants would provide single line switching service and charges and adequate car supply equal to 30 times that of the Rock Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.404" offset="2265004">Protection against strikes, fast competitive rail service over a 1900 additional industries located in the Chicago switching district which would receive direct single line service to the port.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.622" offset="2325817">The elimination of delays due to the interchange of cars between line whole carriers and delivering carriers, and the removal of a hindrance and the detriment to the port which is limited to the services of one carrier, one railroad carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.554" offset="2389556">These are the conclusions of the Commission which are base upon the administrated expertise of the Commission and are not matters for determination by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.102" offset="2431770">And yet that Court without further ado after reviewing the conclusions of the Commission said there is not support in the evidence for such findings, the citation of record reference that we have on pages 7 and 8 of our brief show complete support in these -- of these findings, and the Rock Island does not and could not dispute these record references.</text>

            <text syncTime="662.810" offset="2754644">Incredible as it may appear the majority opinion has taken, has made up largely of sections taken verbatim from the dissenting opinion including the recitation of facts, findings, and even citations of the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.659" offset="2826010">It is evident to the majority of the Court did not understand the decisions of this Court which were lifted verbatim from Judge Edwards dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.883" offset="2862895">Such as Chesapeake and Ohio Railway versus United States and Schaffer Transportation Company versus United States where in this Court said that Congress empowered the Commission to grant authority to construct new lines to create competitive service if and when it should find that it necessary and convenient in the future and present public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.294" offset="2952547">And that no carrier is entitled to protection from competition if the present or future public convenience and necessity wants that additional service.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.301" offset="2996537">These cases which we had cited in our brief and which the dissenting opinion -- Judge have decided, were cited by the majority presumably in support of there con -- conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.171" offset="3048051">The District Court misconceived not only its own -- the effect of the Commission's action but its own function.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.311" offset="3076577">It is obvious the District Court told it was the chief arbiter of the paramount public interest when as a matter of fact, the statute clearly state that this is the Office of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.994" offset="3123388">The District Court is limited to ascertaining whether or not there is warrant in the facts in law for the action of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.572" offset="3149615">The judicial function that Court was exhausted when it found that there was ample support in the record for the -- the findings of the Commission with respect to the size and capacity of Lake Calumet of its future transportation needs and the capacity of the applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.805" offset="3218578">When it made those findings -- when it stated that there was ample support to those findings, its tasks was finished.</text>

            <text syncTime="793.292" offset="3276570">This of course is the Office of the Commission to deny applications where findings supporting the granting of an application to that type are missing.</text>

            <text syncTime="838.941" offset="3459114">Rock Island labels the Commission's finding with respect to a future traffic as based upon conjecture, highly speculative.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.698" offset="3502164">This is the same Rock Island on brief and then again, before the District Court stated and I quote, “We purchased the Pullman Railroad upon the conviction that Lake Calumet Harbor would someday be an international port.</text>

            <text syncTime="1429.702" offset="5822151">Well, I -- there is a difference there which I want to mention in one moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.792" offset="5846497">They say the appellee has argued that there should be a remand to the Commission for further proceedings for a further hearing because of this alleged dullness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.781" offset="5894457">But first I like to suggest that the allegations as to the failure of the port to fulfill to the completely its promise, the predictions of its traffic is not a new development in this case that the Commission had no opportunity to fail to consider in a way because in a petition for reconsideration filed at the end of the 1962, the appellees brought to the Commission's attention, statistics showing the tonnage in freight cars handled by the port between 1957 and 1962, and again argued that a new evidentiary hearing was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.278" offset="6088495">Now the Commission denied that petition for reconsideration and I think correctly so, in this circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.889" offset="6122977">In the first place returning to Mr. Justice White's question, the Commission's decision in which it approved these applications had never relied upon the highly enthusiastic projections of the witnesses in the hearing such as the general manager of the Fourth District Court who had given specific tonnage figures which he expected to before to attain in given years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.605" offset="6237811">All the Commission is fumed as a predicate for its conclusion that this additional service should be authorized was that the Port had excellent long range prospects for growth and development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.645" offset="6297997">And as to this general projection of the port's growth and prosperity, there is no official in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.833" offset="6338748">The appellees witnesses as well as the witnesses for the applicant railroads agree that over the long range, the Port would grow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.795" offset="6382529">Now in the second place and perhaps --and more pointedly, the Commission had found not nearly that additional rail service was necessary to handle the increase traffic that was projected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.714" offset="6458180">But it found that rail service was necessary to induce the hope for expansion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.367" offset="6484825">Commission emphasized that the port needed this rail service from the outset of its development if there was to be development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.522" offset="6521501">And the reason is simply that as the record amply demonstrates competitive and adequate rail service is an enormously important factor in a port's competitive position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.617" offset="6581791">It's clear that Lake Calumet Harbor competes with a great many ports not merely Great Lake ports and other ports in the Chicago area but ports on a gulf coast, the Atlantic Ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.201" offset="6636126">And if Lake Calumet is to compete successfully, Commission found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.774" offset="6654516">There must be competitive and adequate rail service and to give just one example of why this is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.879" offset="6694849">The Commission stressed that an important element of the promise of the port was the center of the grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.495" offset="6729331">The international grain trade and it was evidence that the operators of the large ships which applied this trade are very leery about calling that ports where there may be delays due to adequate railroad cost supply or perhaps, the strike against the rail carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.356" offset="6824835">Other conditions which are -- which tend to be associated with the single line rail service.</text>

            <text syncTime="2394.569" offset="9681690">But all of the evidence and all of these suggestions had been made and considered in the hearing before the hearing examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.825" offset="9718680">So there was no -- there was no new evidence that require additional hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.216" offset="9744280">As I say, after the Commission approved the application with the agreement governing the use these tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.952" offset="9779179">The applicants in the Port District then modified the agreement and the Commission approved the modified agreement without a further evidentiary hearing, although, with notice -- full notice and argument for the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.940" offset="9859114">Our contention however is that that this modification was not material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.385" offset="9880952">It did not raise factual issues which required an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.301" offset="9900596">Now the modification, the only even arguably material modification, there were small changes and worthy community here had to do with computation of the rental that the applicants would be required to pay the Port District to use this 10 miles or so track within the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.164" offset="9992025">Now in the original agreement at which I repeat, there had been full hearing, full canvassing of the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.019" offset="10027447">The annual rental for the use of the tracks was to be the lower of two figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.528" offset="10049494">The first of this was 5% of the current assessed valuation of the rail facilities in the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.454" offset="10081155">And that 5% figure would have come out to about $35,000.00 per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.305" offset="10112606">The second figure was to be computed by multiplying the number of cars handled to or from the district in a year including locomotives and empty cars by $2.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.467" offset="10177285">So that would -- these two methods of computation which ever produced the lower rental would be the yearly sum due.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.669" offset="10218036">Now it's finally executed and approved by the Commission, the percentage evaluation term which I say would have come out to that $35,000.00 was deleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.100" offset="10271744">And the rent became a flat per car rate of $2.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.817" offset="10298598">Now, there was some change in the definition of car that is to exclude locomotives and most empty cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.850" offset="10338722">Basically the new rate is $2.00 per revenue car loaded or partially loaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.219" offset="10368293">So what the question of a right to a hearing boils down to, is whether Commission was required to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether this change in rental formula might so undermined the ability of the applicants to provide a -- an economical and a self-sustaining service that the application should be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.089" offset="10503711">Now, we say that it was not material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.222" offset="10516250">I think there are several reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.436" offset="10529102">The first is that, it is quite obvious to the Commission and to this Court, the railroad industry is one traditionally played by very heavy fixed costs that arriving from its investment in tracks, real estate and engines, and repairs shops and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.694" offset="10622098">And whatever fixed cost to this sort of large part of total costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.041" offset="10651564">The value of the business that affirmed is able to generate becomes critical to its ability to make money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.396" offset="10685001">The more it sells, the railroad industry, the more traffic it handles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.443" offset="10705168">The more revenue it has to cover these heavy fixed costs which by definition remain constant while the traffic increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.566" offset="10749680">And therefore, it seems to us that if -- if the Commission originally found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.879" offset="10770892">It was perfectly reasonable for the railroads to be paid $2.00 per car whether it's a volume was relatively low that is up to the $35,000.00 percent of valuation figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.028" offset="10859499">Now therefore, it must be reasonable for it to be able to pay at the same rate when its volume increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.468" offset="10901295">Now, if that become a little confusing, let me restate it slightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.786" offset="10926477">Under the old agreement, you would pay $2.00 a car but not in excess of the 5% of figure is $35,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.614" offset="10977782">So, if he carried 17,000 cars a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.690" offset="10994082">You would pay the $2.00 rate, $34,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.992" offset="11007352">On the other hand, if you carry 20,000 cars, you would pay only the 5% figure which was lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.245" offset="11036400">So under the new agreement which eliminates this 5% figure, it is conceivable that the total rental in any year might exceed that under the old agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.558" offset="11081644">If they carry 30,000 cars, they will have to pay $60,000.00 roughly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.324" offset="11104632">But as I say, if the railroads could pay these $2.00 rates when volume is very poor, it's down on the 2,000 or 3,000 cars a year level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.592" offset="11145697">They should certainly be able to pay it when there volume is good because if their traffic is heavy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.298" offset="11172551">They will have all the more revenue to be covering there heavy fixed cost and this flat $2.00 rate will be less burden to this rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2799.255" offset="11300342">And as I mentioned it currently carries the cars over the District tracks for no rental payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.691" offset="11338167">Now it's conceivable that the District will in the future sometime want to receive rental from the Rock Island as well but the agreement does find them and as Mr. O'Brien pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.866" offset="11390830">The statement in the dissenting that plan that the appellees were somehow being subjected to an agreement which that not have an opportunity to be heard on is utterly without foundation in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.235" offset="11452270">Now in addition to what -- it seems to us and to the Commission, the logic of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.427" offset="11473063">Why this change in the rental in fact that was immaterial?</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.399" offset="11488946">Commission also stated and I think with considerable foundation that in general it is reasonable for the Commission to accord a measure of difference two rentals terms which had been fixed by arms length bargaining between the -- between parties which have a rough equality of bargaining power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.392" offset="11600959">And I think that principle is particularly valid here because it's quite clear that the Port District does not have an interest indulging the railroads and charging them a rate which will conclude them offering a self-sustaining service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.376" offset="11668877">As I mention, the Port District has allowed the Rock Island to carry cars over its lines at no rental and there's -- let's say the Port is desperately eager to a track adequate rail service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.022" offset="11735437">It's a public non-profit body.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.762" offset="11746408">There's no reason or suppose that it is out to gouge the railroad so that the railroads would be -- would bind themselves to an exorbitant rental.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.998" offset="11799385">And just to touch right briefly on the point raise by Mr. Justice Black as to the bearing of the Universal Camera case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.773" offset="11838464">Assuming that this Court, eventhough, this is a direct appeal that would ordinarily accord a measure of difference to the District Court's handling of the factual issues here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.496" offset="11893321">I would again stress the extraordinary manner in which this majority opinion was drafted and which I think undermines whatever authority it would other applies bring with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.519" offset="11949432">It is a -- it was the material portions on the public convenience and necessity issues were borrowed verbatim from the dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.326" offset="12004707">All of the essentials subsidiary area findings of the Commission were declared by the majority to have ample -- to have substantial support in the record and all -- and in essence all the majority did was to insert the word not before the Commission's -- before the dissenting page conclusion that the Commission's ultimate findings and order had ample support in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.129" offset="12123930">And in those circumstances, I think the much less deference is due the majority opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.099" offset="12155800">And in conclusion then, we urge that the Commission's orders here both insofar as they approved the additional rail service which the applicant railroads propose and also insofar as they approved the applicant's arrangement with the Port District should be sustained, and without any further hearings to delay this litigation which already has prevented like Lake Calumet Harbor from realizing its potentials for these 10 years of litigating.</text>

            <text syncTime="3144.419" offset="12681070">We submit that the issue here is really quite simply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.743" offset="12694340">Assuming the adequacy of the existing service to an area and we submit that there is really no question about the adequacy of existing service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.045" offset="12727568">The Commission made a finding in its order that Rock Island service was adequate and there were really no complaints about it to amount to anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.948" offset="12763199">Assuming the adequacy of existing service, what kind or quality of evidence must the Commission have before it to support a valid exercise of its judgment in approving additional rail service which in the terms of the statute will be required to serve future public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.229" offset="12848253">We submit then that there's really no question about present public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.706" offset="12866226">The Commission's order could not have been founded upon that if it found that the Rock Island's present service in 1957 was adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.888" offset="12898931">We suggest that the District Court resolution of this issue was quite direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.323" offset="12916694">In 1957, with the St. Lawrence Seaway uncompleted with its effect on the Great Lakes shipping traffic really unknown and with only 10% of the Lake Calumet Project constructed neither the applicant railroads and/or anyone else could have prove that the proposed additional rail service would be needed in the reasonably in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.949" offset="13027140">We say there was and is absolutely no need for additional rail service at Lake Calumet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.818" offset="13050650">In the absence of that need, construction of additional rail service would not be in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.853" offset="13074787">This is a very type of wasteful competition which this Court has condemned in many cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3272.120" offset="13191816">In 1957 at the time of the hearing, Lake Calumet Port was for all practical purposes still on the drawing boards.</text>

            <text syncTime="3282.832" offset="13234657">It was uncompleted that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.537" offset="13245524">Because of these facts, it was really no basis for a certificate constructed upon present convenience and necessity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3400.302" offset="13704547">To begin with, the railroad appellant objected to the intervening petitions filed by Rock Island and Nickel Plate and sought to deprive us of an opportunity to be heard and our position to the applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.385" offset="13748955">The fact that Rock Island had made an investment of millions of dollars out of Lake Calumet had in their view apparently absolutely no bearing on the issues before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.139" offset="13787930">Our brief records in detail the large investment that Rock Island made in purchasing Pullman Railroad Company and I don't go into that now.</text>

            <text syncTime="3443.184" offset="13876120">Dedications without compensation, Pullman Railroad Company, the Rock Island's predecessor port gave away its riparian right along the shore of Lake Calumet to the City of Chicago.</text>

            <text syncTime="3478.729" offset="14018330">They have taken no interest in the development of Lake Calumet until in 1956 and 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.407" offset="14044975">It appeared to them that there might be some potential insofar as traffic is concerned at Lake Calumet and they decided to file its applications and get in there if they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.804" offset="14086562">It might be well at this point to examine the position of the railroad appellants more closely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.564" offset="14109654">Now throughout these proceedings, they have attempted to give the impression that they are motivated by a desire to assist in the development of the port and to furnish additional rail service for the benefit of industries that might be located on port property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.298" offset="14172557">The true attitude of the majority of the railroad applicants may be judge from there past conducts in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.840" offset="14198784">And we suggest the story begins back in 1947 sometime ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.497" offset="14217383">At that time, Illinois Central and its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Kensington in eastern railroad filed an application with the Illinois Commerce Commission to extend a spare track across the territory in railroad of Pullman Railroad Company to gain access to the Lake Calumet Port.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.095" offset="14291780">Now, this was prior to the formation of the Chicago Regional Port District.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.542" offset="14309543">It wasn't created by act of the legislature of Illinois until 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.428" offset="14329083">The application was filed by the Illinois Central in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.144" offset="14347995">This application of Illinois Central was resisted by the Pullman Railroad Company, my client, and the New York Central, and the Belt Railway Company of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.514" offset="14385403">Those two railroads are applicants in the proceeding before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.843" offset="14406719">Now in 1949 while that matter was pending before the Illinois Commerce Commission, Rock Island purchased the Pullman Railroad Company in approximately 350 acres of land adjacent to Lake Calumet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.340" offset="14460740">The consideration Rock Island paid for the Pullman was $2, 200,000.00 and that acquisition was approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission that has a very important bearing in this matter, we suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.073" offset="14515702">Rock Island then intervened in the pending Illinois Commerce Commission proceeding to resist the advances of the Illinois Central and its efforts to get into the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.279" offset="14552482">To make the long story short, the Rock I -- rather Illinois Central attempt to gain access Lake Calumet territory was afforded by the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois which held an opinion filed on January 22, 1953 that was just the sort thing which the general rules controlling competition and regulated industries were directed and held that Rock Island was entitled to the fruits of its investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.494" offset="14661360">And that Illinois Central should not be able to invade the territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.821" offset="14686647">Now that Chicago Belt intervene in Rock Island's proceeding before the Interstate Commerce Commission to acquire Pullman Railroad Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.711" offset="14730219">Chicago Belt urged that application be denied and that it be permitted to acquire Pullman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.632" offset="14757909">The Illinois Central also appear in that proceeding before the Interstate Commerce Commission, it contended, the IC contended that it would have no objection to Rock Island's acquire and control of Pullman if Illinois Central were permitted to purchase that part of Pullman Railroad Company located south of 124th Street in the City of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.556" offset="14845576">Namely that part of Pullman which serve Lake Calumet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.969" offset="14859264">In other words, I see he wanted the whole Port of Chicago rather the Port of Lake Calumet for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.051" offset="14887581">Now the Commission in approving Rock Island's application rejected the Belt's position saying that -- there's on evidence in the record that the Belt can do as good a job as or superior than Rock Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.776" offset="14934497">It also rejected the position of the Illinois Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.196" offset="14948185">And the reason the Illinois Central contended that it had -- it should be permitted to purchase the south part of the Pullman Railroad was it up until 1960 and it had a shorts per track serving two ice houses at Lake Calumet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.568" offset="15005654">When the ice houses when out of business, Illinois Central pull up it tracks in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.334" offset="15024671">It had no tracks there since that time until 1949 that that was the basis upon it -- upon which it contended it should be entitle to control Pullman south of 124th Street and serve solely Lake Calumet Port.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.180" offset="15092067">The story continues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.835" offset="15098755">In 1956, further applications were filed by Chicago Belt on one hand and the New York Central and Michigan Central, and the Indiana Harbor Belt two subsidiaries of New York Central and the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.193" offset="15156120">Each of these applications sought to preempt the field then service to Lake Calumet Port.</text>

            <text syncTime="3793.511" offset="15277432">The fact that Rock Island alone is performing the switching service on the Westside of the Port is really not so unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.360" offset="15304808">It is a utility regulated under the law, applicable to all railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.536" offset="15321527">In addition, it operates under the conditions imposed by the Interstate Commerce Commission when the Rock Island pull -- purchase the Pullman Railroad Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.053" offset="15355591">These conditions were required that Rock Island performs service for all railroads in the port area without discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.212" offset="15384221">Again, our compliance with these Pullman conditions and that what's the Interstate Commerce Commission told them does not question in these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.333" offset="15416717">In this proceeding before the Court, the Commission found that we were complying with these conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.891" offset="15442944">If the applicants are successful, the Rock Island investment authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission in the Pullman acquisition case will be seriously impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3844.205" offset="15480142">We sank $2,200,000.00 into that railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.753" offset="15498428">Then that result of the success of the applicants in this case would be the nullification of the former of the action of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.872" offset="15534895">Applicants like to say that our position at Lake Calumet is a monopoly.</text>

            <text syncTime="3868.984" offset="15579303">We have the only physical access to the area out of Lake Calumet Port but we handle cars of all railroads under reciprocal arrangements according to Pullman condition which guaranteed fairness in the handling of all the railroad traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.350" offset="15636773">The in affect you might you say, all railroad served, they came at Port through the switching service of Rock Island.</text>

            <text syncTime="4968.348" offset="19976756">First, that Lake Calumet Port was designed to become the major deepwater port facility in the Port of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="4975.263" offset="20004446">Tonnage anticipated to be handled through like Lake Calumet Port subsequent to the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway would be in the range of $30 million to $58 million tons per year, rail traffic to and from Lake Calumet Port during the coming the year in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="4990.223" offset="20064214">Now the hearing was held in 1957, would be approximately 27,000 car loads a year and could easily increase to 76,500 by 1962, possibly 115,000 cars per year by 1968 and anywhere from 250,000 to 350,000 carloads per year when both sides of the lake were developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.179" offset="20156061">Now, this is the kind of fantasy the Commission considered as evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5018.068" offset="20175600">Now, further so-called evidence considered by the Commission when the Port would be completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5022.634" offset="20193886">There would be 13 docking ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="5025.070" offset="20203604">By 1960 a third grain elevator and five additional transits sheds would have been constructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5031.335" offset="20228681">On the eastside of the lake, the largest commercial tank farm in mid continental America would be built by 1964 to 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.457" offset="20261177">There was no other evidence in the record with respect to the expected rail traffic at the Port.</text>
