            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 62, Samuel Spevack, petitioner, versus Solomon A. Klein.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.073" offset="195688">Mr. Latto.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence J. Latto</label>
            <text syncTime="24.130" offset="199868">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.881" offset="218885">This is the third case which arises out of a judicial inquiry established by the Appellate Division, Second Department State of New York to reach this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.757" offset="258382">The first Anonymous v. Baker to sustain by a narrow majority, the validity of the procedures followed by that inquiry against the claim that where in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.717" offset="314284">The second was Cohen against Hurley, in which by the same majority do upheld the disbarment of a lawyer who withheld by the majority in that case to have pleaded only his state privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.116" offset="379800">That case also was decided before New York and the other state were required to give recognition to the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.921" offset="419088">That requirement being imposed by your decision in the Malloy against Hogan and for reasons which are set forth with greater detail in our brief, we feel that for these reasons, the decisions in Cohen against Hurley is certainly not controlling and indeed hardly enough competitive here.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.448" offset="501112">This case, it does present the question squarely of what construction must be given to the word compel in the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.048" offset="547610">The petitioner here was admitted to the bar of the State of New York in 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.605" offset="569762">He practice without criticism or approach until June of 1959 when he was served with a subpoena commanding him to appear before this judicial inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.360" offset="624828">The subpoena indicated that he would be required to testify with respect to matters pertaining to its businesses and attorney and it also requested that he produced a large number records all of which were designated in 12 separate very broad categories and indeed a catch-all phrase which said that he was required to produce all other deeds, evidences and writings which you have in your custody or power concerning the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.854" offset="762755">Insofar as it appears, there were no charges against him and respondent's brief indicates that the reason that he was called was because he had filed a large number of what are known the statements of retainer.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.789" offset="818552">These are statements which are required to be filed with the Appellate Division by attorneys who have more than a certain number; I believe that's five cases in a given year in which their compensation is on a contingent basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.629" offset="865886">And he had well in excess of the required number and had filed a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.753" offset="890337">He appeared before the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.193" offset="896188">He moved to quash the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.749" offset="902353">This motion was denied, appeals were taken and the denial was upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.089" offset="923773">He then interposed a claim of privilege under the Fifth Amendment as made -- well, he claims the privilege under the state privilege against self-incrimination as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.383" offset="968913">And it was made claim to him at the time he first claimed the privilege that it was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.072" offset="995662">It was -- there was stated unequivocally by the presiding justice that he have an absolute right to claim the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.935" offset="1023143">He was informed that there was a test case pending that was Cohen against Hurley and that would be appropriate to recess the hearing until the determination of that case and this was done and the rather lengthy recess ensued.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.231" offset="1084270">Subsequently, after the decision in Cohen against Hurley, he was again requested to appear after some vacillation he did reinstitute his claim that quite unequivocally and in connection with that, it was made claim to him that while he had a right to claim the privilege, the consequences might be very serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.383" offset="1176952">Indeed that the consequences might be disbarment.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.670" offset="1194088">Irrelevant portions to which I refer are pages 44 and 45 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.152" offset="1235989">The counsel for the inquiry quoted from the Cohen decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.523" offset="1249468">I pointed that it was to be urged that the appellate division -- to the Appellate Division that he was guilty of the same kind of failure to cooperate with the Court which were the basis for the disbarment of Cohen.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.541" offset="1305579">Nevertheless, he adhered to his determination with his decision not to respond or to read -- or to produce these records and subsequently, the Appellate Division ordered respondent to institute proceedings which are procedure filed in New York for disbarment.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.847" offset="1370781">The proceedings were held a rather full account of the proceedings before the judicial inquiry can be found in the referee's report that which is at pages 56 to 81 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.855" offset="1426787">These proceedings are held before a referee.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.328" offset="1436714">There was an petition to the Appellate Division to confirm the order of the referee and the opinion of the Appellate Division is found at record 83.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.052" offset="1499617">Essentially, the Appellate Division held once again, it was perfectly clear that the petitioner had the right to claim the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.555" offset="1537546">But that in doing so, he had failed to observe his obligation to be candid, to be frank, to be cooperative with the Court in which his failure to conform with that duty which was the basis for the other of disbarment.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.910" offset="1603062">The appeal was taken --</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence J. Latto</label>
            <text syncTime="381.936" offset="1631065">Well, we assert of course that it's only on the basis of such inference that this could be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.045" offset="1655515">But the Appellate Division --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="389.132" stopTime="390.894">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="389.132" offset="1659904">Expressly disclaim --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_j_latto" startTime="390.894" stopTime="568.418">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence J. Latto</label>
            <text syncTime="390.894" offset="1666905">The Appellate Division disclaimed any inference of wrongdoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.659" offset="1686026">The Court of Appeals to which an appeal was taken affirmed summarily with a very brief memorandum of opinion which I think I might read it said simply or to affirm now the authority of Cohen against Hurley 366 U.S. and on the further ground that the Fifth Amendment privilege does not apply to a demand, not for oral testimony but that an attorney produce records required by law to be kept with him -- by him, Boyd and Davis, and Shapiro against the United States which is of course the relevant decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.817" offset="1862614">To return to the irrational of the Appellate Division, a -- it assert quite plainly that no inference of wrongdoing of any kind was being drawn from his assertion of privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.047" offset="1919561">The Appellate Division said that when he appeared before the inquiry and I quote its words, he had an absolute right to invoke his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.324" offset="1964701">In other words, the right or privilege not to testify but that he also have a common law right, possibly a statutory right.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.797" offset="1994585">There is a provision of New York law which regulates the practice of law by attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.010" offset="2019453">But he also had this common law duty to testify and that the duty to testify can be separated and viewed entirely apart from the right not to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.021" offset="2063444">Now, the fist question is whether this is simply playing his words as we asserted this or whether this is in fact a fair and meaningful way of looking at this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.809" offset="2110568">The question is most important because if the Appellate Division in the New York courts are correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.167" offset="2136064">Then this really contend a very simple case.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.214" offset="2148185">There's no problem at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.356" offset="2152782">They admit that no penalty, no sanction is being imposed by reason of the invitation of the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.677" offset="2178069">Indeed they say if -- it is not even being impaired or diminished in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.371" offset="2196877">They say they are focusing on this obligation to cooperate.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.696" offset="2210147">His duty to testify and it is unrelated to his right not to testify.”</text>
            <text syncTime="532.752" offset="2234389">I think it can be demonstrated quite easily and readily that there can no separation of these two opposite sides of the same coin and that's best on by considering what would be the result if his refusal to testify had been placed upon the attorney-client privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.026" offset="2315473">Here, I think, everyone respondent to New York courts would all agree that he could not be disbarred for failure to cooperate with the New York courts by failing to be candid, by failing to be frank with them.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="568.418" offset="2377017">No, that's not his privilege.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_j_latto" startTime="570.163" stopTime="608.965">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence J. Latto</label>
            <text syncTime="570.163" offset="2384018">That's exactly the point Mr. Justice Fortas.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.401" offset="2393004">It is not his privilege but the point is that you must examine the reason for his refusal to be cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.913" offset="2422993">The question of what that reason is, I'm putting aside for the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.674" offset="2438040">The only question I'm directing myself to is must you examine the reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.894" offset="2458937">Can you avoid looking entirely at the reason?</text>
            <text syncTime="592.483" offset="2473253">Now, the Appellate Division has said, yes, we can avoid looking at the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.939" offset="2495091">And all I'm asserting now is that they cannot do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.748" offset="2510346">If they could avoid looking at the reason, they could have avoided just as well at its privilege had been the attorney-client privilege.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="608.965" stopTime="616.623">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="608.965" offset="2539186">I shouldn't think so because in fact, with in the attorney-client situation that the testimony is not his --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_j_latto" startTime="616.623" stopTime="1072.265">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence J. Latto</label>
            <text syncTime="616.623" offset="2569906">Yes, that is quite right.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.714" offset="2574190">He has an excellent satisfactory reason for his failure to be cooperative for his failure to be frank with the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.063" offset="2607626">The failure is exactly the same but you excuse it in that case because he has no privilege whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.655" offset="2633958">He has no basis for refusing to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.825" offset="2646706">But you examine the question of whether he has a basis or no basis for refusing to answer in reaching your conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.623" offset="2677844">And this is what I say must be done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.199" offset="2688188">In examining the question of whether he is guilty of a failure to cooperate with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.224" offset="2708250">You must examine the question of whether he has an adequate basis or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.126" offset="2727894">The question before the Court is not whether these two opposite side of the same coin can be viewed separately but whether his failure to comply with his obligation to be cooperative with the Court is subject to the claim of privilege or not subject to the claim of privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.476" offset="2805321">This is phrase incidentally which I draw off in Justice -- Judge Cardozo, then Judge Cardozo in the case of Karlin v. Culkin when he was Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.914" offset="2855058">It seems to me that's the question which must be decided is his failure to cooperate subject to the privilege which is his by virtue of the Fifth Amendment or is it not subject to a privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.024" offset="2899466">Now, that question was not looked into, not examined at all by the courts of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.219" offset="2920260">But it is I think before this Court and I should like to turn to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.453" offset="2941158">The question then is, what are the possible bases for concluding as New York would like to conclude that this duty to cooperate must prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.985" offset="2979297">Now the first is the one adhere to suggested by Mr. Justice Harlan and that is I suppose it could be held that in the proceedings such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.144" offset="3019943">An inference of guilt or of misconduct might be drawn, though you cannot under the Griffin case draw such an inference in other proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.441" offset="3065187">This I must say would go into conduct to virtually every decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.894" offset="3082951">If there's one thing that's clear, if there's one thing that has no division within the Court about it is that the no improper inference of guilt and misconduct of any kind may be drawn from the invocation in the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.475" offset="3153272">This is the (Inaudible) decision in Grinwold and Griffin.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.288" offset="3172498">So I think this manner of saying that the duty to cooperate with the courts which regulate the practice of law must be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.589" offset="3217742">The second possibility would be to engage in analysis of the comparative value of a -- the comparative importance the way to be given to the need to cooperate with the Court as against the policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.298" offset="3280541">The importance of the privilege against self-incrimination and here again, I think we run into a consistent line of decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.362" offset="3316799">So far as the Fifth Amendment had been interpreted date, it's been uniformly held that this kind of process is not engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.283" offset="3348459">Whatever the Fifth Amendment mean, it means and it's not to be abridged by virtue of what is considered to be a greater objective of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.975" offset="3403316">The objective of punishing persons who are thought possibly guilty of murder or other serious crime is certainly as important to one as we know.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.857" offset="3450755">But it does not prevail against the Fifth Amendment and so I think that some sort of waned process to determine the relative value of these two again must be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.091" offset="3507702">I may say in passing that even in such process where to be engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.462" offset="3529226">It would not be on the basis of simply determination of which would they considered to more valuable.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.304" offset="3560573">The test would have to be one of necessity rather than reasonable relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.030" offset="3575515">The same test which has been applied in Shelton v. Tucker, McLaughlin against Florida and a host of other cases that wherever a regulatory function has the tendency to impair a significant constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.714" offset="3630268">A much sterner test has been applied by this Court and I presume will continue to be applied by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.569" offset="3657644">We then come to the only other two bases that I can see for reaching the conclusion that the duty to cooperate must prevail over the privilege against self-incrimination and that would be to construe the Fifth Amendment narrowly so as to make it not apply in this situation at all or to employ some sort of waiver approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.858" offset="3766836">Now, I mention the two of these together because the arguments which are used for each of these possible bases for narrowing the protection of the privilege tend to be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.025" offset="3823470">In each case, the same starting place is to consider the role of the lawyer in our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.660" offset="3846040">It's pointed out that the lawyers are engaged in the administration of justice that there were no public service, that they operate on the high ethical standards which are greater than those normally applied, normally demanded of other professions.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.761" offset="3902464">Now, of course we agree fully that membership in the bar carries with it proud obligations that are not imposed upon other occupations nor a profession say if the duty to represent indigents for example, without compensation to the court in line, limitations upon what we may properly do in advance and the interest of our clients is another.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.927" offset="4003088">I think however that as lawyers and as judges, we have to guard against being taking too parochial view and guard also against being swept away by this rhetoric.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.274" offset="4048436">The -- there's no question that the state as a result of the special law of the attorney may regulate the practice of law very closely indeed but there is a second more important question here and that is whether there's a constitutional difference between the authority to regulate the bar and the authority to regulate any other profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.833" offset="4142686">And try as I may -- I don't think I can find one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.089" offset="4155747">There are countless other oblig -- other occupations that maybe and are being regulated by the state and while they don't avow the administration of justice, they all relate in some very significant way to public health to the public safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.912" offset="4219068">At least they involved some legitimate concern of a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.656" offset="4237981">And I see no way in which one could not find a rational basis, a rational reasons for a legislator to conclude that if it is regulating a particular occupation that it would be more effective, more efficient, if it could demand the persons who are engaged in that occupation that they respond to certain questions relating to the manner in which that business is carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.184" offset="4352084">You always in every instance in which there is regulatory activity being carried on be able to construct a sound reasonable argument of this kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="1075.717" offset="4406209">I certainly hope too, because I think that the argument I make in here affect the Shapiro point as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.665" offset="4442049">I simply would like to point out that this area that I'm discussing would not involved merely occupation subject to regulation but the very vast area dealing with the use of public resources, dealing with the use of benefits of one kind or another that the Government provide to its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.006" offset="4519372">I'm talking about such things as at lease of government land that received the proper support payments more of its insurance, the use of public airports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.888" offset="4550928">In all of this area, it is always possible to construct a rational argument for showing that the program can be administered more efficiently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.851" offset="4594813">If the recipients of these benefits where to respond to questions about how the benefits are to be used?</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.859" offset="4618846">And if the Fifth Amendment is to be construed so that it no longer apply in every instance in which there is regulation of a particular industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.732" offset="4666284">Then this would represent about his drastic or rejection of the decisions of the past two terms as could be possibly imaginable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.606" offset="4701811">Now, I pass over my discussion of the weight of privilege to get to the Shapiro case because I think that what I've been saying until now affect the Shapiro doctrine as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.399" offset="4748936">In that case to recall it briefly to your mind, the Court held that wherever a statute or regulation requires keeping records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.229" offset="4788328">Those records which otherwise would be considered private which might had been kept prior to the adoption of the statute are somehow converted into if not public record at least quasi-public records and that they're not protected against disclosure by the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.116" offset="4859800">Now, this holding was preceded by a sentence in the Court's opinion which bears reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.410" offset="4900968">The Court said, “It may be assumed at the outset that there are limits which the Government cannot constitutionally exceed in requiring the keeping of records which may be inspected by the administrative agency and may be used in prosecuting statutory violations committed by the record keeper himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.476" offset="4973275">But then the Court went on to say, “No serious misgiving that these bounds have been overstep would appear to be evoked where there is -- when there is a sufficient relations between the activity sort to be regulated and the public concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.485" offset="5029282">So that the Government can constitutionally regulate or forbid the basic activity concerned and can constitutionally require the keeping of a particular records subject to inspection by the administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.781" offset="5078497">And while that sentence is somewhat circular, its breadth is enormous and particularly in terms of the way which the commerce power and the police power of the state has been interpreted today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.380" offset="5120920">But the Court has said, “It's in every instance where a business is subject to regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.267" offset="5140459">Its records which are designated as required to be kept no longer are entitled to the privilege against self-incrimination in the face of the set of rule that the privilege applies to documents as well as to oral testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.267" offset="5204407">Now, this -- the question really is how shall broad an en route into the privilege against self-incrimination could have been rendered by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.761" offset="5250382">The fact is that there is a uniform cause of constitutional adjudication from Boyd and running through Malloy and Griffin, and Miranda last term in which repeatedly, this Court has announced that the privilege against self-incrimination is to be given a broad and not a niggardly or grudging interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1962.847" offset="7954787">And this associate at the New York Court of Appeals has disbarred the petition because he refused to cooperate by relinquishing a valid Fifth Amendment privilege is with all duel deference to my adversary contrary, to the record facts as well as to the actual judgment of the New York Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2062.672" offset="8354043">And I submit to Your Honors that that is the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.831" offset="8378702">The State of New York and of the states but particularly the State of New York has for years been confronted with a difficult problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.909" offset="8419035">Namely, to try to control the evils that haven't -- as a result of experience are risen from the contingent fee negligence practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.597" offset="8477759">There was a time when New York prohibited contingent fees as well as other states in U.S. Inland and other foreign countries prohibited today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.386" offset="8520913">The theory behind such prohibition is that the contingent fee introduces a speculative element which leads to or stirring up the litigation in passing the obligation, the duty that a lawyer has to a client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.852" offset="8602728">It has cost what it almost a national disgrace namely the overcrowding of our calendars of federal and state courts where litigation that doesn't belong there because it is not merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.751" offset="8666363">But recognizing those evils is one important justification for permitting the contingent fee practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.137" offset="8699904">And it is the only justification for it namely, to put our courts of justice within the reach of the accident victims of which there are many in our highly industrialized mechanized society today, to put those courts of justice within the reach of those accident victims all because of financial inability even though they have a meritorious cause of action, cannot afford to pay a fixed fee for representation by competent counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.526" offset="8849429">It is that important consideration that has induced New York and other states of our human to permit the contingent fee and to provide for necessary rules and regulations so as to prevent these evils from arising.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.388" offset="8924975">And what has New York done? For many years, not yesterday goes back to at least 1940, after some very bad experience starting in 1928 that established special rules that are very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.571" offset="8989654">The first is that every attorney engaged in contingent fee negligence practice must file with the Appellate Division.</text>

            <text syncTime="3716.206" offset="14968247">The Cohen v. Hurley case dealing solely with a refusal to answer question that my time to incriminate is overruled I cannot not assume that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.237" offset="15008371">I've answered Mr. Justice Brennan on this to what my own point of view is because I happen to believe that no lawyr bunch of case that make him can be deprive of a constitutional right and merely because are all required to relinquish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.242" offset="15076289">Put it that way because that's the way they brief repeats it to relinquish a constitutional right in order to hold on to a job or to be a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.312" offset="15116622">That's my personal point of view but I do not speak for the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.857" offset="15130833">In this case, I submit the New York Court of Appeals fully aware of this Court's mandate under Malloy v. Hogan that we must follow the federal standard did precisely that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.630" offset="15181928">And now, my learned adversary is asking to this Court really to say to the New York Court of Appeals, “Mr. Court of Appeals, you had no business following our standard as enunciated in Shapiro and other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.559" offset="15237622">There are others, the Fair Labor Standards Act is a good one where federal statutes are involved.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.626" offset="15265834">I submit sir, I would add this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.937" offset="15275133">This emphasis on the language selected from the opinion of the Appellate Division is on warrant and for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.004" offset="15303346">First of all, its no -- I don't mean any disrespect to this Court for me to say that Your Honors do not seek to revise the opinions of an intermediate cause of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.400" offset="15349008">It is only to correct judgments involving federal questions rendered by the highest court of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3819.174" offset="15380041">And I submit sirs, that on the judgment here and on the particular facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.780" offset="15406477">The constitutional rights of the petitioner or no way violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.497" offset="15425390">And I submit that is evident to be held otherwise then not only New York but every state in the union would simply be frustrated in any reasonable efforts to control the abuses in contingent fee negligence practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3926.812" offset="15810644">It was carried on in the Fair Labor Standards Act where the federal government steps in, in order to protect minimum wages, maximum allowance, requiring those engagements to state commerce, the employers to keep records as to the wages paid in hours work in order to protect the economy our country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.439" offset="15901132">And this Court, the case is cited in the Shapiro case, United States against Darby, unanimously upheld that kind of a valid regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3970.754" offset="15986395">Here is a lawyer who pursuant to the rules filed statements of retainer, gave information, profited by the permission granted to engage in extensive contingent fee negligence practice and after he did so, he was called upon to account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.500" offset="16069360">He then says, “I won't”.</text>

            <text syncTime="4016.888" offset="16170924">As far as I'm aware about federal and state law agreed that he has no such right.</text>
