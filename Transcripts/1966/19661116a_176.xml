            <text syncTime="47.399" offset="292968">So far as the stipulation is concern, I think we plainly concede that the statement in the stipulation that Mr. Travis did not "bear" a valid United States passport specifically endorsed to travel to Cuba could not or just standing there alone sustain a conviction if this Court were to conclude that the only way that you could violate Section 1185 would be if you had no passport at all when you left the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.573" offset="433716">In other words, if Section -- if this Court would conclude that Section 1185 applied only to departures with either a revoked or expired or no passport whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.511" offset="481468">In other words, we think that the statement in this stipulation prevents her conviction on that theory so that if we are wrong on our major argument here this Court would hold that we're wrong then we don't urge that her conviction could be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.563" offset="549595">We do however urge that if the Court were so to hold we should be free to retry the petitioner on that ground and we think that that's plainly within Bryan versus United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="127.297" offset="612603">Well, in other words, we think what that would be is that would be a failure, a really quite and accidental, I think failure of proof because of the construction of the -- because of the ambiguity of a stipulation as to a particular element of the offense which the Government did not believe it had to establish at the time this trial was conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.171" offset="696090">Now, we think that's what Bryan versus United States in 338 U.S. held when it construed 28 U.S.C. 2106 to authorize a remand for a retrial and that's in effect what this Court did as to a substantial number of the petitioners in the Yates case in 354 U.S. so that so far as the stipulation is concern as I say, we would -- we concede that her conviction could not just simply be affirmed if our major position is rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.814" offset="802670">On the other hand, we do think that we should be permitted to a retrial on this indictment which simply charges a violation of 1185 pretty much in its terms and to prove at such a retrial that she in fact had only a revoked passport and therefore if she did have only a revoked passport we submit she's no better off for having travelled to Cuba then if she had gone with the revoked passport to Paris or to London or any place else.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.705" offset="906219">The statute on its face plainly we think, prohibits that if it prohibits any.</text>

            <text syncTime="249.845" offset="1102764">Well, we think -- we -- definitely and that's why we concede Mr. Chief Justice that she couldn't be convicted on this stipulation if our principle line of argument is rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.154" offset="1151979">And we say that if it is then the most we're entitled to do is to go back and retry her and introduce that element of the offense which we did not as of the time the first trial believe we had to prove.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.354" offset="1328776">Because we think that's really what Bryan and what Yates say that if the Government is -- has proceeded under the wrong theory of law the first time and there's no reason to believe that it simply trying a second trial in order to introduce evidence that or in order to present it to another jury if you like.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.240" offset="1416338">Then fairness and justice which is what 28 U.S., the words in it, the standard incorporate in Section 2106 really entitles the Government's fell back for a retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.979" offset="1455313">I must say candidly Mr. Justice White, I don't know that this was intentionally so designed.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.080" offset="1475688">I think probably both parties at the time the Assistant United States Attorney who drafted the stipulation, Mr. McTernan believed that the issue was where the travel to Cuba was a violation of Section 1185.</text>

            <text syncTime="457.057" offset="1931577">And it's a very difficult burden that was established in this case and in Laub, the Government had such proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.608" offset="1977762">If I -- and then if I may just respond Mr. Chief Justice in Mr. McTernan's comment that 18 U.S.C. 1544 is noble and was not cited in response to the Senate Committee's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.910" offset="2038993">The answer at least so far as it appears in the hearings on page 59 specifically does cite 18 U.S.C. 44.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.535" offset="2069504">The Department of State responded that there are laws in which might well be violating the course of such travel, e.g. trading that the enemy act and treasury regulations there under, 18 U.S.C. 1544, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.989" offset="2115375">So, it was specifically cited at that time and it appeared in the passports.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.008" offset="2135437">So, I think it's quite clear that this other statute is not a noble creation of the Department of State just raised for purpose of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.162" offset="2187995">Turning to the Laub case, that case is here on direct appeal pursuant to the Criminal Appeals Act from a dismissal of a one count indictment charging nine appellees with conspiring to violate Section 1185 by inducing and recruiting a group of individuals to depart the United States for Cuba without bearing passports valid for travel to that destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.004" offset="2283395">In this case, unlike Travis the status of the traveler's passport is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.759" offset="2302412">It was made so by the Government's bill of particulars which alleged that all the persons referred to in the indictment, in other words those who were traveling posses during the relevant period unexpired and unrevoked United States passports which however had not been specifically validated by the Secretary of State to travel to Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.509" offset="2381406">So, this case does not involve the ambiguity presented in Travis.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.649" offset="2405961">Two of the appellees here, Laub and Luce (ph) were also named in a companion indictment which charged them and two others with having arranged an earlier similar trip to Cuba one year prior to the trip involved in this indictment in June 1963 and with having made trips to Cuba in violation of Section 215 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="595.448" offset="2485164">The defendants in that case except Luce were tried in the Eastern District of New York in a non-jury trial at the conclusion of which the District judge found them all not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.944" offset="2527169">His opinion in that case which contains extensive factual findings and an elaborate discussion of a law was incorporated by reference since the judgment of dismissal in this case because the grounds of this -- for dismissing the indictment here were identical to his grounds for entering a verdict of not guilty in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.055" offset="2603551">The judgments in both cases rested on the District judge's conclusion that Section 1185 (b) did not cover departures for destinations on which travel restrictions have been imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.664" offset="2650049">The judge in the present case in other words agree with the principle contention made by the petitioner in Travis that Section 215 (b) is only a "border control statute" ends the question of statutory construction squarely presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.790" offset="2710549">Now, I find and I'd like to continue along that line in discussing what really was the major thrust of the District judge's opinion, the District Court's opinion in this case and of the claimed made by the petitioners which is -- and this relates back to a question of Mr. Justice Harlan's yesterday, "What the administrative practice of the Department of State was?"</text>
            <text syncTime="672.862" offset="2794872">Now, the District Judge here found and petitioners have argued in Travis and the appellees have found -- have argued here that it was a Department of State's continuous position up until travel restriction were posed in Cuba that the restrictions put in to the passport as to the invalidity of the passport to travel to certain destinations were civil only and contemplated no criminal sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.606" offset="2897795">Now, as I try to explain in the earlier argument -- in the Travis case, the real difficulty here arises out of the fact that there are two criminal statutes which might apply to travel to restricted areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.843" offset="2958712">One is the one which prohibits use of a passport in violation of its terms and conditions and which would be violated therefore if the traveler in the foreign country used the passport to enter the country, showed it or in some other way exhibited it.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.819" offset="3018689">That's 18 U.S.C. 1544 and we submit that it's quite clear from the administrative practice that the Department of State had always viewed that statute which applies both in peace time and in war time as applicable when there is proof of use.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.763" offset="3094444">Now, petitioner or the -- and the -- petitioner in Travis and the appellees here and the District judge below relied on certain statements made by the Department of State in 1919 and 1952 and in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.284" offset="3168528">I think those really do not support the conclusion that the Department of State was in effect disavowing criminal sanctions for violations of area restrictions and I'll get to that in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.144" offset="3227982">But I would also like to call attention what is quite clear and what is not been cited out below and it was -- it's not cited and discussed in our brief either but it's quite -- what is quite clear is a press release for example issued or press release issued at the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 where the Department of State announced that passports which are therefore been issued would not be valid for use and travel from United States to any country in Europe unless it is submitted to the Department of State for validation.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.193" offset="3372178">Now, that announcement which appears at page 534 of Hackworth which is cited in our brief and in the volumes cited in our brief and in the briefs in Travis and Laub and by the District judge also says the same thing as the passports themselves said which is, should a person to whom a passport has been issued use it in violation of the conditions or restrictions contained therein the protection of the United States may likewise be withheld from him while he's abroad and he will be liable for prosecution under the provisions of Section 221 of Title 22 of the U.S. Code which reads in part and then it quotes that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.211" offset="3536227">In other words, the very press release that announced that there -- restrictions would be imposed prior to World War II specifically referred to what is now 18 U.S.C. 1544.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.556" offset="3585546">Now, it's true that the Department of State did not at that time refer to this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.901" offset="3606967">The very simple reason is that this statute was not on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.763" offset="3618461">Its predecessor was not on the books either.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.953" offset="3627133">This statute was enacted in 1914 to apply only in time of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.284" offset="3648554">It was reenacted in 1941 to apply in time of war and during the national emergency which have been declared by President Roosevelt in May of 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.090" offset="3687737">It was reenacted in 1952 to apply in time of war and during any national emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.889" offset="3710934">Well, the time that restrictions were imposed prior to World War II, Section 1185 or its predecessor which just not a viable statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.694" offset="3758164">Now, the District Court below or the petitioner in Travis and the appellees here point to really three statements, public release as issued by the Department of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.605" offset="3801840">One was the release issued in 1919 when hostilities were over and which did not refer to any criminal sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.145" offset="3827963">Well, that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.224" offset="3836217">I mean it certainly didn't refer to the predecessor of Section 1185 because 1185 apply only in time of war and it was very questionable whether it could've applied then.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.258" offset="3880417">They also rely on the press release issued in 1952 when restrictions were imposed on travel to iron curtain countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.763" offset="3910405">But 1952 was two years after President Truman had announced the -- a nation -- a new national emergency in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.407" offset="3944991">The Act passed in 1941 was no longer applicable at the time the new area restrictions were imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.412" offset="3969024">The Act passed in 1941 applied when the United States is at war or during the national emergency announced in May of 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.059" offset="4007581">By 1952, the United States was not technically at war and the national emergency announced in 1941 had been superseded by the national emergency announced in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.110" offset="4047809">So, obviously the restrictions imposed in 1952 could not have made any reference to the statute enacted in 1941 because it too was not a viable statute at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.631" offset="4093889">A month later after the imposition to travel restrictions then, the statute involved here was enacted in that provided that it was to apply that in times of war and in times of national emergency and of course that statute was applicable thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.018" offset="4171421">It was not specifically cited in the -- or specifically listed in the passports, the other statute was 18 U.S.C. 1544.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.191" offset="4204126">But the fact that the Department of State did not refer to this statute or its predecessors in the 1919 release, on the 1952 release we think doesn't establish anything because neither or it certainly quite arguable that neither of those statutes was applicable at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1180.243" offset="4824377">Well, we think that definitely a difference there but it -- we think that what it does show is that the legend on the passport that says not valid for travel to particular countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.370" offset="4876831">It was always supposed by the Department of State to be enforceable by criminal sanction and that if the passport indeed had not cited any statute at all but had merely said these restrictions are enforceable by criminal sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.802" offset="4942555">In other words, it left it quite ambiguous as to what the criminal sanctions were or what could permissibly be done then I think they -- would certainly be no basis for the argument that petitioners are making or the -- petitioner makes in Travis to the appellees here that they weren't put on notice that there was any criminal sanction attached to area restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.470" offset="5017266">We're saying in other words, that Congress really armed the Department of State or the executive in the enforcement of these kinds of restrictions with two strings to the bow that because most instances of area restrictions, first of all, area restrictions in peace time and area restrictions as to countries with whom we did have diplomatic relations and a substantial number of area restriction that go -- did involve countries with whom we had diplomatic relations and where a passport would be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.851" offset="5142758">So because the substantial number of violations of those would probably be covered by 18 U.S.C. 1544 the Department of State focused its attention on that statute but there was really another string which Congress have provided and we just don't think that the executive should be prohibited from using the second string simply because it's been given an addition to the first and its mainly when it provided warnings in the passports which referred to the first.</text>

            <text syncTime="1531.875" offset="6230915">And it -- indeed Mr. Chief Justice I think that also bears on the reasons why the mandatory legislation may very well consort that if a committee such as that thought that the Department of State in effect conceded that there were no criminal sanctions the Department of State then felt it was obligatory to seek a legislation and we could make that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.838" offset="6326732">Now, I would just like to go to one final point which is a point that the District judge here rely on and he said, "Well, why Congress really intended to make it a crime to violate area restrictions, why was that not specifically spelled out in the statute."</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.750" offset="6406353">And I think that there are really two possible -- we really have two answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.999" offset="6423385">First of all, specifically spelling out in this statute that area restrictions will cover and that would be a violation of this statute to travel in violation of an area restriction would by the rule of construction of exclusio unius exclusio alterius possibly lead to a court's ruling that any other restriction on the validity of a passport might not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.973" offset="6519306">And as I've tried to demonstrate the Secretary of State finds it necessary to impose other restrictions on validity such as the restriction in the official passport to its being restricted to official use only or even the restriction that a passport is not valid until it is signed, that its not valid if it's mutilated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1626.599" offset="6609795">But the -- but I think that that's just one possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.083" offset="6623692">I think Congress may have thought -- it wanted to give broad powers without presenting these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.731" offset="6650337">I think another problem really was that as of that time it may very well have been dubious as to whether Congress could constitutionally enact the statute that would make criminal a conduct which is engaged in totally without the jurisdiction of the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.132" offset="6719927">It wasn't until 1922 when United States versus Bowman in 260 U.S. that this Court first -- not even in a square holding met that contention had said that it would be permissible and it wasn't until 1932 in the contempt case of Blockburger versus United States in 284 U.S. that that was squarely decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.473" offset="6813236">So, I think there have may very well have been substantial doubts even back in the 1918 as to whether a statute could be enacted that said, if you travel the country "X" in violation of the Secretary of States -- in violation to Secretary of State's restrictions in his passport, in your passport, you've committed a crime because then just the mere act a crossing that boundary would've been the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.980" offset="6927339">We think that the Congress in 1918 which had the problem before it for the first time and which later Congress has adopted really knew of the Department of State's policy of restrictive endorsements as of war time and when they enacted a war time statute but they intended at that time to say was that such restrictions of the Secretary explicitly imposes in his passport are restrictions which if a traveler departs in violation of them with the intent to violate them, he is violating the criminal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1746.862" offset="7090866">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.573" offset="7105703">Before I begin my brief argument in chief, I do want to make reference to what counsel has just said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.842" offset="7138722">It appears here that a good part of his case depends upon the construction of Section 1544 with which none of us here have been prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.300" offset="7184593">And it appears also that the persons who have the greatest knowledge of the meaning of the statute presumably a correct knowledge that the statute is not applicable could avoid prosecution and that those who like the defendants in these cases who don't have the expertise as counsel has suggested should be subject to prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.859" offset="7274768">The fact is that everybody in authority in the State Department and I mean everybody that our briefs will show has agreed that Section 215 is not applicable to area restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.978" offset="7335267">And that the area restriction provision comes under a different heading of the State Department's power, the power of the Foreign Relation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.877" offset="7374869">And that this view which has been expressed by chiefs of the legal division of the passport office and we have cited by the Directors of the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs whom we have cited is uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.819" offset="7426696">And I may say has been subscribed to by another great Solicitor General, one who argued Kent against Dulles who said in talking about passport restrictions, and I'm from reading his brief which we have cited that this restriction, the power to impose area restrictions would carry no sanctions, I repeat, no sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.923" offset="7527111">Since the statute referring to Section 215 or 1188 makes it unlawful only to depart or enter the country without a lawful passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.970" offset="7575280">And I may say that -- some urge we cease the controversy, allow the controversy between the defendant and the Government is really a basic controversy between the State Department and the Internal Security Division of the Department of Justice because the State Department knowing of the 600 old law cases over the years has never suggested so far as the record show a single prosecution and it was only until the Cuba problem arose that a prosecution was decided upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.199" offset="7700146">Now, we are here for the third time in eight years arguing the meaning of 1185.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.533" offset="7729507">And the only difference between this case and the others is that we're here confronted with a criminal proceeding which the problems are the construction of a statute, a so much serious and so much more obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.831" offset="7778722">Although what Mr. Justice Douglas said in Kent against Dulles cast -- light upon this because he recognized the nature of the statute as one involving an impairment of civil liberties and also the fact that it was a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.631" offset="7837863">Now, bearing in mind that this is a criminal statute, how does the Government which has the burden of showing that this statute not 1544 is applicable to these clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.427" offset="7885093">How does the Government treat this important problem?</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.971" offset="7899303">It says with respect to the statute upon which it relies in this case, 215 (b), that's 1188 does not in so many words, I thought words were what governed that is not in so many words prohibit violations of area restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.908" offset="7979029">And it says in another place in his brief, I won't take the time to give the pages up since they're all in my brief and in the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.718" offset="8006196">Section 215 (b) was not as explicit in prohibiting violations of area restrictions as it might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.821" offset="8042663">It's not a diplomatic problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.990" offset="8051336">This is not a letter of introduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.912" offset="8059068">This is a criminal statute we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.537" offset="8069517">Well, let us suppose that the statute is not clear and let us assume although I think its not proper in a criminal statute that the Government can turn to legislative history thus rely upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.842" offset="8114761">How does it describe the legislative history which is voluminous I may say?</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.213" offset="8136182">It describes it at his brief at page 20 as amici.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.212" offset="8152168">Well, perhaps legislative history is missing, can the Government show a different purpose from other evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.926" offset="8183097">No, the Government says, the debates do not show and I quote, "Any awareness of the problem, the problem of area restrictions", has it ever occurred to the Government that the debates don't show any awareness because this is not the problem with which Congress was concerned in 1918 and in 1941 when this whole matter was debated fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.015" offset="8275466">Well, let us assume that all these tests are wrong and we must turn to the administrative interpretation of the statute though I would not of course agree that absent, legislative support, even the State Department could admit it to the statute in a way contrary to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.690" offset="8346102">As to Section 215 (b), what does the Government say?</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.135" offset="8363865">It says 215 (b), it says the Department has not called this application, this criminal application they're talking about, to public attention as much as it might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.755" offset="8410363">And State Department officials have occasionally, I say uniformly, have occasionally suggested that no criminal sanctions lie behind the Secretary's area restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.167" offset="8468041">And as to the press release of May 1952 which the Chief Justice adverted upon which the Bar Association made a comment and I may say that the Bar Association had a committee, had as a member Mr. Adrian Fisher who was legal adviser previously to the State Department and is a well-known scholar in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.827" offset="8550693">After this press release issued by the Department of State, the Government describes it as quote, "somewhat ambiguous".</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.230" offset="8584338">And by the way counsel is wrong when that press release was issued in 1952, there were in effect still the Act of 9 -- the provisions of the Act was 1941 as continued by Congress until the Immigration Act could be passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.190" offset="8648182">And as to the testimony which we have referred to in our brief of all of the Department officials testifying on the subject of area restrictions, what does the Department of Justice say about the Departmental officials from the State Department who were authorized to enforce and to implement and to administer this passport law plainly unsound.</text>

            <text syncTime="2186.868" offset="8850892">I suppose and since it's a criminal case I could rest upon what the admission, about the admissions made by the Government but the admissions are made because there is voluminous evidence to support us in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.396" offset="8908988">There is a language of the statute, a statute that talks about departing and entering, referring to the borders of the United States, not the borders of Cuba or China.</text>

            <text syncTime="2391.307" offset="9668629">The stuff that is now talked about these modern days when we try to rewrite a statute what President Wilson was concerned about and that Congress misspoke of 1918 and 1941 was to seal the borders of the United States against aliens, neutral aliens who may suspected by -- be crossing to commit sabotage and espionage and against American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.582" offset="9765700">And repeatedly in this meager legislative history as it was referred to we have references to espionage, subversive activity, ingress and egress not a word it said about area restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.663" offset="9825991">Not a word and this is again an example of a tail -- wagging the dog it was referred to but in another sentence by Mr. Justice Black yesterday when the Government refers to the instance of Canada as a sort of area restriction because another country has been named, it assumes as an area restriction, that was not a restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.368" offset="9900805">That was for the purpose of being sure that Canada could be treated that it was part of the United States, a non-restriction so that American could go across the border without having any passport not with having passport validated for travel for Canada, without having any passport at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.253" offset="9976351">Now, I've indicated in our brief, the absurd results that was followed from the Government's attempt to change this statute into an area control statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.979" offset="10023267">One example is this, a man leaves the United States intending to go to Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.621" offset="10045837">He commits the crime when he passes the border of the United States if you adopt their construction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.236" offset="10068302">The man however doesn't want to go to Cuba but he goes to France and while on France he decides to cause his great conflagration by going to Cuba himself and giving the Secretary of State all these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.339" offset="10112711">He goes to Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.260" offset="10116368">No problem at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.641" offset="10121906">Well, its -- this is only a little example of how absurd the whole situation is because you are attempting to take a statute intended for one purpose and put it into another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.447" offset="10173210">This whole question of the needing of term valid of course no matter what they -- we say or they say about what valid means we have to consider valid as to what.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.086" offset="10219708">Now a -- that a passport is valid within the extreme of cases going under 211 (a) or 22 U.S.C. valid in the sense that it is a letter of introductions then discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.230" offset="10268296">It was the old conception of the passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.338" offset="10276760">It's not dead, happens not to be practically as important as the exit and entry one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.365" offset="10296822">And from that point of view a passport is valid or invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.612" offset="10313853">But when we are talking about a valid passport within the meaning of a departure and entry statute we mean valid for the purpose of crossing the American border, that's what valid means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.324" offset="10368711">And as a matter of fact it is the construction given by the Department itself in the passport handbook which we have cited in our brief and which says that validity -- I'm paraphrasing, refers to the duration of the passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.090" offset="10443734">And Your Honors will recall that when before the Senate Committee on Security and Consular affairs, passport officials were asked what the meaning of the term "valid" was, what was their answer?</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.294" offset="10492531">Said the Chief-of-the-legal division as he then was, "Well, in effect that says this Government is not sponsoring the entry of the individual into those countries and does not response to the entry of the individual into those countries and does not give him permission to go in there under the protection of the United States".</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.682" offset="10558151">Not a word about criminal prosecutions that I must that the line that has been read here really does not represent in my view ascriptions as the departmental official, a fair reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.695" offset="10610186">I can find nothing in this volume or anything else supporting the Government's construction because it was not the construction of the State Department and never has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.008" offset="10651355">And as the present acting Bureau later Bureau Director of the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs pointed out from his point of view, we've cited it, it's in our brief, passport validity and restrictions all relate to this subject of Foreign Affairs under the 211 (a) problem not under the departing and entering concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.027" offset="10775489">Now, we come to the administrative implementation of a statute and as to that as we show Your Honors never under the Immigration and Nationality Act or its predecessor statutes of 1918 and 1941 was there ever a proclamation, an executive order, a State Departmental regulation referring to area restrictions authorizing area restrictions that of course we know taking the other side of the coin never when area restrictions were imposed by the Secretary of State where they impose except under the heading of an alleged injuring power or a passport act where there was a -- an Act of 1926 or a prior Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.823" offset="10962631">These are the two lines which have to be kept into consideration in analyzing what we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.691" offset="10994186">Now, I pass over the various statements that have been made by the Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.663" offset="11033997">I call the Court's attention to the fact that even in Zemel in the District Court as the record at -- record 63 will show Your Honors, the Government's position, the Department of Justice's position was that the area restrictions were under 211 (a) and not under 1185, the statute involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.857" offset="11134830">With respect to the need for a legislation let me say a word, of course a proposal that has been made by a governmental department doesn't prove, it doesn't have the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.999" offset="11187388">But what shall say here when there has been this avalanche of proposals made by the Department of State and by Congressmen, sympathetic with it or not sympathetic with it to give the Department of State this particular kind of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.841" offset="11258755">I don't understand the explanation as been given that perhaps somebody thought the Department had the power or perhaps they disagreed with the extent of the power that the Department wanted because the bills were sufficiently varied to take into consideration every possible contingency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.517" offset="11325419">The fact is and this is one of the interesting facts of life that despite the foreboding of the Department of Justice in Kent against Dulles, the Department never, the -- was able to get the authority to turn Kent against Dulles back although clearly the Department doesn't have the power to deny passports, the people on political grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.544" offset="11413504">And so here, the Department has not been able to persuade Congress to give it this power now sought for nine years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.206" offset="11456240">We think that what Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in the (Inaudible) case is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.050" offset="11475571">This practical construction of the Act by those entrusted with its administration is reinforced by the administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.334" offset="11508694">I'm paraphrasing one word, unsuccessful attempt to secure from Congress an expressed grant of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.620" offset="11541817">And that explains not inadequacy in writing a brief, that explains why we have the Government's brief in this case Mr. Chief Justice because this is all there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.986" offset="11579329">The Government is unable candidly to find anything in this statute which would justify its application and I think even in the civil statute talking about 1185.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.097" offset="11619767">Now, this construction the Government seeks is of course also, one, which would pose directly the questions put by Mr. Justice Black namely, "Is the statute a clear statute and where are the legislative standards?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.957" offset="11691238">I take from my authority if Your Honors who have seen throughout this argument the Department of State and I think that what Mr. Philip Heymann, the present Acting Director of the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs and a well-known scholar said very candidly that the Department isn't interested in problems of litigation but in getting things done and in stating the problems fairly to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.277" offset="11796459">What Mr. Heymann said in the hearings we have cited in our brief is we agree with the need to provide clear statutory authority for the imposition of necessary area restrictions and appropriate enforcement provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.636" offset="11873886">And he said, in the present view held either before or after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.345" offset="11896769">In other words, right now we have broadly worded authority to do whatever we want and very sloppy statutory authority to enforce what we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.169" offset="11960090">Well, I think it has been demonstrated by all of counsel here that the authority is so broadly worded as to be meaningless if we are to interpret 1185 as the Government suggest and Mr. Heymann never suggested 1185 to be used here and obviously to say that there are sloppy statutory authorities to enforce what we want here is equally appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.953" offset="12075133">And Mr. Heymann then addressed himself to the second problem that was discussed here by Mr. McTernan, the questions of standards because we are dealing here, if the Court pleases with an Act as I think Mr. Justice Black pointed out by an Undersecretary of State for Administration and I may say the new regulations that came down a short while ago that we referred yesterday by a deputy, Undersecretary of State for Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.223" offset="12180250">So we're moving down the ladder now as we regulate the conduct of citizens suppose to affect their criminal status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.332" offset="12216717">Mr. Heymann said on the subject, as you know the Secretary's authority to restrict travel has until now been exercised without any legislative enacted standards and required procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.943" offset="12287143">One of the important purposes of the proposed State Department bill is to provide congressional standards for the restriction of travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.087" offset="12327685">Well, I suggest that until we have carried out Mr. Heymann's proposal and have a statute that is precise and had one that has standards and until we have had a statute that is clear and there has some legislative history behind it to support the Government rather than this multiplicity of evidence against it that the prosecutions could wait.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.133" offset="12431862">Thank you Your Honor.</text>
