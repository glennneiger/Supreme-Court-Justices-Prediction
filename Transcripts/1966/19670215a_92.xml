            <text syncTime="39.037" offset="259532">This is a health inspector case and involves with the meaning of the Fourth Amendment which is the vexing an important problem which has been with us for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.768" offset="314493">The appellant in this case believes that the Fourth Amendment is more than written of mere words.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.528" offset="345527">It was written of the long experience of the colonists under the English rule in framing the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.720" offset="382203">It was written as its very word state to protect the security of the citizens and residents of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.549" offset="421595">It was not meant to be a nose of wax to be twisted to the convenience of petty government officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.136" offset="459943">This case arose when an official wish to inspect the apartment of the appellant because he had learned that the appellant was living in an apartment which he did not believe was covered by a certificate of occupancy in an apartment house.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.581" offset="533713">He went to the appellant, asked him whether he as living in this apartment, the appellant said, “Yes, he was”.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.740" offset="562343">The health inspector then said, “May I come in and inspect.”</text>
            <text syncTime="119.726" offset="582301">The answer was, “Do you have a warrant?</text>
            <text syncTime="122.176" offset="592123">Do you have a complaint?”</text>
            <text syncTime="125.265" offset="604453">The answers to both of those questions were, “No.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.215" offset="616260">This is a routine inspection.”</text>
            <text syncTime="130.697" offset="626186">And it was a routine inspection, permission was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.435" offset="645099">Again, the health inspector came back --</text>

            <text syncTime="153.275" offset="716466">But it was not done as it was in Frank versus Maryland, it's a relevant complaint by an individual?</text>

            <text syncTime="161.313" offset="748648">There was no complaint at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.176" offset="764113">The only reason which has ever been offered is that the apartment may not have been the covered by the certificate of occupancy but that was sufficiently answered when the appellant said, "Yes, I do live here".</text>
            <text syncTime="179.998" offset="823359">And then the inspector came back two more times and on the second -- third visit, November 22nd, 1963 in the afternoon, the inspector again required -- said that he wanted to enter the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.198" offset="896188">It was denied, permission under exactly the same circumstances and for this offense on November 22nd, the appellant was charged with a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.661" offset="937984">We attempted to prohibit that crime through California procedures in the California Courts but that prohibition proceeding did not succeed because the courts below relied on Frank versus Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.654" offset="997961">Now, the inspection was done under Section 503 of the San Francisco Municipal Code which provides that any city employee in the performance of his duties may inspect any premises at reasonable times as long as he is performing his duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.957" offset="1095241">You will note that the statute does not require any warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.506" offset="1109347">It does not require any probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.572" offset="1121677">It was -- it does not require any complaint and no appointment is necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.817" offset="1202657">It's not limited in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.622" offset="1209866">Although, it is a part of the Municipal Code the -- however, I would point out that the Municipal Code does contain criminal sections which punish certain acts as crimes.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.929" offset="1259081">Well, do you -- does it -- that wording it would seem to give blanket authority to the police department of the city to enter any house at anytime so long as he was looking for a criminal or looking for anything to do with the criminal offense without any warrant at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.011" offset="1331388">Is it -- as your -- has the State of California construed it to mean that?</text>

            <text syncTime="312.278" offset="1352495">In all fairness I should say, that I know of no instance where a policeman on his own in searching for some criminal evidence has used this statute as you say the wording of the statute as any city employee and certainly the policeman are city employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.364" offset="1424802">As of yet, no policeman has tried to use this section to my knowledge.</text>

            <text syncTime="358.386" offset="1536920">And we think that if this case should be affirmed that the welfare people would certainly take advantage of it as well as property tax people, urban development people, anyone who thought that they had a reasonable interest in coming into a home.</text>

            <text syncTime="3410.459" offset="13745194">And I think in some of the questions here one of the main differences was brought out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.110" offset="13775809">On a search warrant, you show probable cause to believe that contraband, to believe that the weapons of crime, to believe that smuggled goods or something are in a particular premises, a particular apartment, a particular home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.754" offset="13846340">And the magistrate can weigh that and decide whether or not you should be allowed to enter into that home and search and reduce those things to your possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.016" offset="13887404">These inspections and particularly the -- this are the annual inspection that we've been discussing and the planned area inspections where several blocks are carved out for inspection every -- so often.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.654" offset="13946023">The whole purpose of this is to determine what the situation is in respect to those buildings, not whether somebody has something tucked away in a trunk or a chest some place but to find out what's going on in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.239" offset="14000358">And I don't think a magi -- I think the magistrate would be reduced to the position of either rubber stamping whatever is presented to him of -- to say so with the Department of Public Health that they want to make an inspection of this 10-block area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.514" offset="14057409">Either that or he is going to turn himself into the Department of Public Health and the Planning Director and decide should we go to the Fillmore District.</text>

            <text syncTime="3497.816" offset="14094608">Should we go out in Hunters Point and make inspections in this area?</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.378" offset="14108923">And I don't think our magistrates are frankly equipped for that or that there is any requirement of law that they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.125" offset="14139852">That's certainly no requirement of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.373" offset="14152913">The magnitude of an effective inspection program is such that I think any requirement of a search warrant would be abs -- would in effect mean you couldn't conduct the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.149" offset="14204008">We have 145,000 inspections in 1964 by the Department of Public Works, as I said before, 50,000 inspection trips to 16,000 buildings in the fiscal year of 1964 and 14,500 dwelling units inspected under the urban renewal program.</text>
