            <label>Mr. S. Myron Klarfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="16.003" offset="167372">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.614" offset="181791">The question presented by the Lewis case is whether or not the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution is violated when a government agent gains entrance to the home of citizen without a search warrant and by disguise and deception for the purpose of soliciting a crime and obtaining evidence to be used against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.009" offset="271444">The facts briefly are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.681" offset="282102">On December 3, 1964, a man by the name of Jimmy the Pollack telephoned to the home of the petitioner telling him that a mutual friend had said that the petitioner had some marijuana and that he, Jimmy, wanted to buy some.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.075" offset="359633">The petitioner responded that the mutual friend had mentioned Jimmy and Jimmy thereby procured an invitation to the home of the petitioner for the purpose of obtaining some marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.105" offset="415744">Jimmy the Pollack arrived at the petitioner's home, went into the apartment, sat down, they discussed the price, made his purchase and prior to leaving, Jimmy the Pollack stated that if he was satisfied as to the quality of the marijuana that he would probably give Mr. Lewis a telephone call in a few weeks and return to get some additional marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.152" offset="515950">Several weeks later on December 17, 1964, Jimmy the Pollack again telephoned the home of the petitioner and stated that he wanted some additional marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.835" offset="562761">Again, he went to the home of the petitioner where he received his marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.797" offset="586585">Almost five months later, on April 26, 1965, Jimmy the Pollack again showed up at the petitioner's home, only this time, he came with a warrant for the arrest of Mr. Lewis.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.034" offset="651473">Prior to the trial, the petitioner had filed a motion to suppress the evidence used to convict Mr. Lewis at the trial and that motion was seeking to suppress the evidence, admissions, and conversations which the petitioner alleged were procured in violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.802" offset="734542">Jimmy the Pollack in reality was Mr. Edward Cass, an undercover agent for the Narcotics Bureau of the Treasury Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.249" offset="768397">He was -- he was called to the witness stand on the motion to suppress evidence and was asked the following questions and gave the following replies.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.610" offset="801834">Question: At some time during your investigation prior to the arrest of Mr. Lewis, did the defendant Mr. Lewis become a suspect?</text>
            <text syncTime="182.697" offset="834121">Answer: Yes, he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.613" offset="841853">Question: Can you tell us when it time that was Mr. Cass?</text>
            <text syncTime="188.672" offset="858049">Answer: Yes, sir, in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.080" offset="871737">I bring this respectively to the attention of the Court and remind the Court that the two purchases which were made were made in December of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.799" offset="910608">The defendant therefore was a suspect for over a year prior to a time when these two buys were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.994" offset="935372">Question: On or about Thursday, December 3, 1964, did you communicate by telephone with the defendant prior to going to his home?</text>
            <text syncTime="217.615" offset="973824">Answer: Yes sir, I did.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.602" offset="981765">Question: Was the purpose of your telephone call on this date sir to inquire about a purchase of about a quantity of marijuana?</text>
            <text syncTime="226.933" offset="1011127">Answer: It was.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.626" offset="1017919">Question: On said dates, December 3, and December 17, 1964, Mr. Cass, did you pose as someone other than the federal officer that you are?</text>
            <text syncTime="298.406" offset="1297011">Answer: I did.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.791" offset="1296906">Question: Whether or not you represented your self to the defendant on those occasions, that you were Jimmy the Pollack operating a bar and grill in Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.964" offset="1296802">Answer: That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.051" offset="1296697">Question: When you went to the defendant's home on December 3 and December 17, Mr. Cass, did you have a search warrant for that purpose?</text>
            <text syncTime="261.014" offset="1296593">Answer: I did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.880" offset="1296488">Question: At the time you went to the defendant's home on December 3, 1964, did you suspect from information you had received prior thereto or based on your own personal knowledge or otherwise that the transaction might take place at the home of the defendant so far as the transfer of marijuana is concerned?</text>
            <text syncTime="288.835" offset="1296384">Question: When you went to the home of the defendant on December 3 and December 17, Mr. Cass, did you not go there for the purpose of obtaining narcotics from him?</text>
            <text syncTime="300.479" offset="1305266">At page 31 of the record, the fact is disclosed that one, Richard Gold was the informer who had put the agent in touch with Mr. Lewis.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.827" offset="1350719">The petitioner waived a trial by jury as the facts were not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.286" offset="1376528">The petitioner was found guilty and sentenced according to law and the conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="369.494" offset="1581328">Now, the petitioner's argument for reversal is based on six brief grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.275" offset="1600449">First, the circuit court in confirming the convictions relied on the case of the United States versus Pasquinzo, 334 Federal 2d page 74.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.476" offset="1641305">This was a Ninth Circuit case where the agent was in disguise but the purchase of the narcotics took place in a drugstore which is a place in business open to the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="1382.419" offset="5633024">My fifth ground deals with the separation of powers doctrine as the safeguard to the police state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.871" offset="5662908">The Government has the right to use informers and this particular question is not an issue here now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.417" offset="5693001">But the Government has argued and urges that to outlaw what I have choose to call a sneaky peek method of getting into the home would immunize criminal activity in the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.145" offset="5743992">However, the McDonald case which had been relied upon by the Government at page 27 of their brief dispels any fears in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.413" offset="5777011">Here it was said that the presence of a search warrant serves a high function absent some grave emergency, the Fourth Amendment has interposed a magistrate between the citizen and the police and this was not done to shield criminals nor to make the home a safe haven for illegal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.277" offset="5856528">It was done so that an objective might waive a need to invade the privacy in order to enforce the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.247" offset="5884322">The right of privacy was deemed too precious to be entrusted to the discretion of those whose job is the detection of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.594" offset="5921729">And finally, my sixth ground deals with the result of legalizing this type of entry by deception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.395" offset="5952972">If the Government seriously contends that striking down this kind of intrusion will immunize crime in the home which you cannot and will not, we should hear the Government's response to what I am about to say next.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.387" offset="6008874">I am compelled to point out to this Honorable Court that if the police power is enlarge to permit this type of conduct on the part of the Government, then the people of this great land innocent or otherwise could never be certain that the postman, the priest, the rabbi or some repairman coming into the home was not a government agent bent on spying into the home or into the private affairs of its occupants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.203" offset="6108139">Just think of the great distrust of our Government this situation will create.</text>

            <text syncTime="1680.230" offset="6824312">Petitioner promptly indicated that he was disposed to deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.617" offset="6853883">There is not only that indication of his disposition to engage in the transaction but the fact later develops that he had the stock on hand, that he had marijuana in his home, confirmed the fact that he was a person who was already engaged in a course of criminal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.353" offset="6944789">So far as I know, no court has ever considered that an undercover agent, that is to say one who has concealed his identity as an agent is disabled by the Constitution or by any principle of law from testifying to criminal acts or admission which occur in his presence simple because he concealed his true identity and because the other party would not have done what he did if that identity have been disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.603" offset="7125765">Of course undercover agents and also accomplices who later turn state's evidence have been used in literally thousands of cases from the time that our courts first began to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.346" offset="7208730">Indeed the existence of informer statutes in this country goes back to the first Congress of the United States, the same Congress which enacted the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.447" offset="7277171">Although petitioner makes his argument primarily and perhaps almost exclusively in terms of the fact that in this instance, the transaction took place in the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.575" offset="7341641">I'd like first for a few minutes to examine the question quite apart from the home on the assumption for the moment that the transaction had taken place somewhere else say in the alley in back of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.006" offset="7423352">Now, it seems clear to us that the Fifth Amendment furnishes no guarantee and I speak of the Fifth as well as of the Fourth that a person to whom I voluntarily speak and make an incriminating admission or whose presence I commit an offense will respect the confidence that I place in him by performing that act or engaging in that conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.788" offset="7534529">The risk as the person to whom the words are spoken is an informer as Justice Brennan put it in his Lopez opinion is the kind of risk which is inherent in any human society, the kind of risk we take whenever we speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.769" offset="7634422">And by the same token, it seems to me that a thought or a spoken word is not seized in the sense of the Fourth Amendment when one of the positions of this petitioner voluntarily engages in a face to face conversation and engages in a criminal transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.786" offset="7722506">In such circumstances, there is no invasion of the person of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.787" offset="7746539">In such circumstances, what he chooses to say and what he chooses to do is simply a means of furthering the criminal enterprises in which he chooses to engage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.577" offset="7793664">In such circumstances, I would say he has parted with no secret for he acted in the agent's presence precisely as he would have in the presence of any customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.545" offset="7849566">Now, petitioner's argument seems to acknowledge implicitly what I've argued thus far but he says this case is different from the case which takes place in the -- a transaction which takes place in the alley or in the parking lot or in the restaurant or in the bar because it took place at petitioner's residence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2171.851" offset="8790810">Let me refer to a few of the cases which clearly place this on issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.145" offset="8815992">Let me begin with On Lee, in the On Lee case, the friend who was in fact an agent came on to the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.275" offset="8876492">That man was named Chin Poy and outside of course, there was another agent, unbeknownst to the owner of the premises who was listening in through a device.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.066" offset="8931662">This Court divided on the question whether the outside agent who had intruded through the electronic device could testify but no member of this Court had any doubt that Chin Poy, the government agent who entered the premises could have testified had he been called.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.420" offset="9017031">Reference was made the other day to Judge Frank's dissent in the Second Circuit in the On Lee case and to the fact that Judge Frank had emphasized the protection to which the person is entitled in his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.858" offset="9078784">Now what was not mentioned about the Judge Frank's dissent in the On Lee case was that Judge Frank was also quite clear that Chin Poy could have testified in this case and indeed he said that the Constitution provides no safeguard against errors in judgment as to the character of persons whom I admit into my home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.187" offset="9188080">This Court then a few years after had the Trupiano case before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.579" offset="9209710">There was a case in which a government agent secured employment as the so-called mash man and went to work in an illegal still which was located on a private farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.042" offset="9279509">The detailed information which that agent obtained was relayed to other agents on the basis of which they obtained a warrant for the arrest of those operating the still.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.533" offset="9341471">And though there was division in the Court on a point which is not relevant here, the Court had no doubt in that case, all of the members of the Court, that the valid -- that the arrest warrant had been validly obtained.</text>

            <text syncTime="2332.983" offset="9435303">The question on which the Court divided was whether the ancillary search was within proper confines or extended too far, the search incident to the arrest and finally I would mention the Lopez case itself which has been discussed several times in these three cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.178" offset="9540106">In the Lopez case, a separate argument was made that quite apart from the use of the electronic device.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.101" offset="9579813">There had been a deception when the agent went into the office of Mr. Lopez and the deception it was charged was that the agent had indicated a willingness to accept the bribe and had he not indicated that willingness, he wouldn't have been admitted and the man wouldn't have put some money on the table.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.072" offset="9679705">And the Court and I think this is true of all of the opinions of the Court refused to accept that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.748" offset="9706350">It was rejected as shortly in the dissenting opinion as in the Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.004" offset="9735398">As I indicated earlier, Mr. Justice Brennan emphasized in his dissent that there is no constitutional objection to the use of an undercover agent and that the risk that a person with whom I deal may be an informer or may turn out to be an informer later or is acting on behalf of the Government that he is not what he pretends to be is a risk-inherent in human society.</text>

            <text syncTime="2519.522" offset="10181465">I should mention the Gouled case upon which petitioner principally relies because it seems to me that that clearly points up an important distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.857" offset="10242800">Gouled as we see it is a quite different kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.410" offset="10269027">There the Government employed an agent who was a friend of Gouled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.640" offset="10301942">It was seeking information about Gouled on charges of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.991" offset="10327333">The agent went to Gouled's offices ostensibly to pay a friendly call upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.123" offset="10355858">The agent was admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.267" offset="10360456">He engaged in conversation with Gouled and thereafter Gouled absented himself from the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.112" offset="10395773">Unbeknownst to Gouled and without his consent, the agent then went through his desk drawers, took some papers out, incriminating papers and pirated them away these were subsequently offered in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.458" offset="10477171">Now, it was in that context the agent doing secretly and without the owner's knowledge something to which the owner of course did not consented that the Court concluded that there had been an invasion of the papers owned by the person who occupied those premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.500" offset="10581347">It was in that context that this Court said that regardless of the mode of entry the taking of the private papers was unconsented to and was unknown to the owner of the premises and constituted an invasion of his Fourth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.539" offset="10657520">Now, in this case of course, we have situation in which the agent did nothing which was not known to the owner of the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.444" offset="10709138">He was the intended listener when the statements were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.566" offset="10733589">He was the intended recipient when the marijuana was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.099" offset="10779773">In closing, I would like to emphasize the breadth and the sweep of the rule for which petitioner is here contending.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.075" offset="10831705">I've indicated earlier that it is a completely noble contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.997" offset="10859395">To my knowledge it has no support not only in a decision of the Court that has no support so far as I know in any opinion of the single justice or judge but not only is it a noble contention but I would like to stress what is I suppose already obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.343" offset="10948733">That if such a rule were accepted it would seem to me that for all practical purposes, no informant or accomplices or undercover agents could be used and that I think would indeed be a sweeping and unprecedented step, one which we think finds no justification either in the history of the Fourth Amendment or in the decisions of the Court.</text>
