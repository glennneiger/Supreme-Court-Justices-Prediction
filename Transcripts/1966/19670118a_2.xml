            <label>Mr. Jacob D. Zeldes</label>
            <text syncTime="9.287" offset="140518">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.293" offset="156505">One more block in the Kahriger-Lewis foundation I believe deserves mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.573" offset="181687">In the Kahriger case the Court said, the privilege has relation to past acts only and not to future acts that may or may not occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.145" offset="227976">This we think is basically unsound in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.473" offset="245217">First of all, it came solely from a citation in Wigmore and the background material in Wigmore demonstrates that it really has no application to this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.089" offset="291715">For what Wigmore was talking about were occupation such as -- and this are the examples he mentioned pawn brokers and drugers who had to refer to certain licensing and reporting obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.824" offset="346676">Nothing of the nature here involved where the activity is so fundamentally illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.736" offset="370291">I think another aspect to this that varies mentioned is that no court prior to this Court's decision in Kahriger in any way stood and upheld the principle that is born out in the Wigmore generalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.931" offset="435075">So the recent cases of this Court if Your Honor please, undercut the foundations of Kahriger and Lewis.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.970" offset="467257">The Government offers no basis to show how these rationales of Kahriger and Lewis are consistent with the doctrine of the Fifth Amendment as it's now known.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.007" offset="511352">I'm well aware of course that the members of the Court have been decided on certain issues relating to the Fifth Amendment divided on certain issues related to the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.689" offset="550118">But nothing in the recent disents in Garrity and Spevack or Malloy, suggest that there's any vitality left to the Kahriger and Lewis cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.338" offset="592750">From a common practical everyday point of view, what do we have with this tax?</text>
            <text syncTime="130.664" offset="625977">We have a wagering tax which the United States says, cannot pay for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.139" offset="655966">In other words, it cost more to enforce it than it nets the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.762" offset="674461">And we have it working as a squeezing device on the citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.333" offset="692746">The citizen has the choice to comply or to defy the wagering tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.072" offset="715630">If he complies with the wagering tax law, he puts himself in a state jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.634" offset="733915">If he defies the wagering tax law, he puts himself into a federal jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.965" offset="755231">It seems to me Your Honor this is fundamentally opposed to the whole concept of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.197" offset="780204">Almost as if in accord with that notion, the Government spends very little time attempting to bolster Kahriger and Lewis.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.761" offset="818448">What the Government does if Your Honors please, is offer to this Court as an alternative, the suggestion that there need not be invalidation of these tax statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.044" offset="871528">What does the Government say?</text>
            <text syncTime="193.440" offset="877171">The Government says assuming that these statutes are unconstitutionally violative of the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.700" offset="906219">There is no need here to uphold the traditional right to silence which is the backbone of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.256" offset="936417">Rather says the Government, “Leave the tax statute standing but exclude from evidence anything that comes from the tax laws so that there is no possibility of incrimination in the future.”</text>
            <text syncTime="222.260" offset="992423">What the Government then says is we must have an exclusionary rule, down with the concept of silence which is so fundamental with the Fifth Amendment right and up with the concept of an exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.908" offset="1055013">As a basis for this rule, the Government relies almost exclusively on Murphy versus the Waterfront.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.305" offset="1092629">And I think that that case must be put in context to show why the exclusionary rule that the Government relies upon has no real application.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.790" offset="1138500">In the Murphy case if Your Honor please, the concept of dual sovereignty was overturned by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.351" offset="1168802">After that was done, the Court then faced this problem and it said it quite specifically, we must now decide what effect our abandonment of dual sovereignty has on the state immunity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.718" offset="1234213">For in the Murphy case, unlike situation in the case at bar there were state immunity statutes involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.966" offset="1263261">The witnesses had been afforded immunity by the States of New Jersey and the State of New York which were there involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.693" offset="1294190">So the sole issue in the case involved in Murphy was how do we rule in connection with the immunity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.254" offset="1336404">The Court had two alternatives that faced it.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.984" offset="1363257">If the Court would have said, “Alright, we will uphold the traditional right to silence”, which is the basis of the Fifth Amendment, that would have in effect invalidated all state immunity statutes because it was fundamental that the states could not extend immunity from federal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.914" offset="1435042">On the other hand, if the Court would have expanded the doctrine of immunity, it would have run completely afoul with the supremacy clause since its fundamental where the states cannot extend to federal prosecution, immunity from prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.163" offset="1504005">So the result in that peculiar circumstances where immunity statutes were an issue was to fashion this exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.825" offset="1538696">But the exclusionary rule has no application here because of the lack of the immunity legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.647" offset="1569938">I think perhaps the case that most clearly demonstrates this is Malloy versus Hogan, decided the very day as Murphy.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.662" offset="1618004">In the Malloy case, there was no immunity statute and the Court upheld the traditional right to silence in reversing and they did not fashion an immunity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.959" offset="1659173">So for these reasons if Your Honor please, we think that the immunity alternative, immunity from use, that the Government proposes is not a meaningful one and that the traditional right to silence in this Fifth Amendment area should be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.223" offset="1724270">We think that Kahriger and Lewis were wrongly decided and that recent decisions of this Court clearly emphasize that.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.128" offset="1751855">And for these reasons, we respectfully request that this Court reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="468.810" offset="1978598">And there they're listed as I count them about 10 or 12 convictions.</text>

            <text syncTime="489.495" offset="2061354">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.440" offset="2077132">In the Government's view what this in the related cases really involved is whether gamblers can refuse to pay a tax because the business -- their engagement is illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.424" offset="2129063">Petitioner in this case as has been pointed out was convicted for failing to register as required under the federal wagering tax laws and also for failure to pay the special occupational tax, $50 tax, on those engaged in the business of accepting wagers.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.568" offset="2197608">On the companion Grosso case which we'll be argued subsequently, the petitioner was convicted for failure to pay the 10% excise tax on grocery receipts from wagering.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.796" offset="2250585">I don't think that I have to deal at length with the fact that professional gambling is one of the largest business enterprises in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.289" offset="2288515">And although gamblers gross many billions of dollars per year, it's common knowledge that they pay very little on taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.235" offset="2320280">Now, they're of course -- they are of course subject to income taxation but obviously collection is very difficult because of the nature of their operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.675" offset="2362075">Unlike many other businesses, gambling has been subjected by Congress to an excise tax, a wagering tax that's here at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.082" offset="2407737">This tax as the Court well knows was upheld by this Court over constitutional attack in the Kahriger and Lewis cases decided in 1953 and 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.391" offset="2456952">Certiorari was granted in this case, limited to the question whether in light of this Court's decision last term, in Albertson versus Subversive Activities Control Board, Kahriger and Lewis should be overruled.</text>

            <text syncTime="613.109" offset="2555800">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.819" offset="2566666">In our view, those cases properly considered and properly construed are still good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.769" offset="2594461">Should the Court disagree however and find merit in petitioner's Fifth Amendment contentions we suggest that the appropriate result here would be to uphold the wagering tax laws while adopting a rule prohibiting the use of any information disclosed as a result of compliance with those laws, in any subsequent criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.637" offset="2677948">Before discussing Kahriger and Lewis in the context of Albertson, which is of course the central issue here, I would like to touch briefly on our view of the substance of the constitutional claim asserted by petitioners in this -- in the related cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.924" offset="2739075">They don't deny that they're gamblers.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.480" offset="2745344">Indeed, that's essential to their constitutional contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.574" offset="2761644">They don't assert that the wagering tax is not a tax major, they slap at it occasionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.070" offset="2783692">Such a position, I think they recognize would fly squarely in the face of this Court's limited grant of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.808" offset="2814621">And they don't deny that under the wagering tax laws, they were required to register as being engaged in the business for accepting wagers and we're required to pay the prescribed taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.981" offset="2855267">What they say however is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.087" offset="2867702">They say that they're excused from compliance with the wagering tax laws because of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.767" offset="2894451">Since gambling is illegal under the laws of most states, compliance with the wagering tax laws they assert would require them to incriminate themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.295" offset="2932590">This they say they can't be compelled to do, since the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination is now under this Court's decision in Malloy versus Hogan fully applicable to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.998" offset="2983372">In petitioner's view in short, state law has the effect of limiting the federal tax problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.819" offset="3006673">Thus they conclude they cannot be prosecuted for failure to register, file a return to pay the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.857" offset="3034781">As against the statutory requirements, what they essentially assert is the right to remain silent or right to go on with their business in privacy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1882.618" offset="7633795">As the Court pointed out in those cases the registration requirement does not compel the individual to make incriminating disclosures in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1901.151" offset="7707982">Just like anyone else considering going into a business, he has to decide for himself whether he's going into the particular business and accept the conditions that are attached by Government to engaging them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.133" offset="7759914">The time that this choice has made he knows that if he decides to accept wagers, he will be required to comply with the federal wagering tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.324" offset="7792619">There was a grace period at the beginning of the statute when it was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.147" offset="7811950">And indeed a lot of people for a time get out of the waging business because of the thing, because of the federal tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1938.343" offset="7856776">So viewed, the requirements of those laws including registration and payment of the occupational tax are under Kahriger and Lewis, known conditions to the voluntary act of engaging in the business and this I should add was a construction given by Judge Friendly in the opinion below to this Court's decisions in Kahriger and Lewis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.258" offset="7936397">The Court stated in Kahriger, that a perspective gambler as merely informed by the statute, “That in order to engage in a business of wagering in the future, he must fulfill certain conditions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.010" offset="7979447">In Lewis, the Court said if petitioner desires to engage in an unlawful business, he does so only on his own volition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.557" offset="8009644">The fact that he may elect to pay the tax and make the prescribed disclosures required by the Act is a matter of choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.265" offset="8036394">There's nothing compulsory about it and consequently, there's nothing violative of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.408" offset="8056978">The only compulsion under the Act is that requiring a decision which would be gamblers must make at the threshold.</text>

            <text syncTime="2083.455" offset="8437217">What you're saying here is that in order to engage in this business, the person has to make a disclosure and then the disclosure is a disclosure that he's engaged in illegal activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2125.129" offset="8603878">Petitioner doesn't say that anyone forced into engaging in gambling and in our view is voluntary decision to do so results in his being required to register and pay the tax, whether in our view petitioner really seeks as a protective status for his business because of its illegality that in our view is not required by the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.472" offset="8689246">Now getting to Albertson, we feel that Albertson can be reconciled with this analysis that are stated here in Kahriger and Lewis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.690" offset="8718085">Now we realized that it could be said that Communist Party members had a period within which they could get out of the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.045" offset="8747551">And thus to that extent had a choice as to whether or not they would subject themselves to registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.545" offset="8777540">But under the facts of Albertson it's clear that the petitioners there had no choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.966" offset="8799274">Specific orders of the board required them to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.940" offset="8819127">In addition, Communist Party membership without knowledge of its unlawful purposes or intent to further them as constitutionally protected under the First Amendment so that the compelling registration might have the effect of deterring lawful association.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.870" offset="8874820">We can perceive no such countervailing constitutional interest involved whether disclosure pertains not to speech or association with engagement in gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.103" offset="8919751">Moreover here, the wagering tax registration requirement as we developed in our brief serves a valid governmental interest, incident to the exercise of a power separate and independent, power to tax, separate and independent for many specific interest in the underlying activity whether it's legal or illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.449" offset="8993207">Registration requirement in Kahriger is characterized as directly and intimately related to the collection of the tax and is obviously supportable in -- as an aid of a revenue purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.520" offset="9037406">It seems to us that that valid purpose serves to distinguish it from the registration provision involved in Albertson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.574" offset="9061648">That provision as the Court pointed out, particularly in light of the board's determination serve little purpose other than to require the revelation of incriminating information directly toward regulating the very activity which the registrants were required to admit activity in subversive organizations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2992.044" offset="12071581">Well, it's -- no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.580" offset="12073671">It seems to me (Voice Overlap) that there're really two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.454" offset="12085164">One has to do with the initiation of the thing, and the other it seems to me has to do with what the practice and development under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.268" offset="12124453">And it hasn't produced much revenue, and everybody knows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.481" offset="12149321">The point that I was making was addressed to the original purpose of Congress in enacting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.939" offset="12171160">It was a great bit of cynicism about it and I have the same cynicism I point -- as I said when I first came to this thing and I was kind of surprised with reading the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.855" offset="12210761">Now legislative history can say whatever anybody wants it to say, I understand that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.491" offset="12233331">But in the floor debates, either they hadn't thought about the thing or there are a lot of naïve people around because there are over and over indications that the purpose is to try to get some revenue from this massive business that's going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.290" offset="12304488">If you can't stop it at least we can get some money out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.530" offset="12317445">That was the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.966" offset="12323192">Now, I think you point out that the thing as Justice Black points out that the tax hasn't worked out to produce that much revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.521" offset="12361435">I don't know why it hasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.425" offset="12369063">One reason to that is because that people aren't registered but the -- pay the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.387" offset="12392887">One problem relates to enforcement of collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.244" offset="12408351">But it seems to me that's a different problem and the purpose of Congress initially in enacting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.771" offset="12446490">Another aspect of Albertson should be mentioned in passing as Justice Brennan pointed out, the Court in Albertson carefully distinguished the Sullivan situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.287" offset="12492570">An income taxation of income from illegal sources has been consistently upheld by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.859" offset="12514826">In our view, Sullivan is in some respects distinguishable here but it's not fully in apposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.865" offset="12538859">Just like the non-tax fare in Sullivan, the non-tax fares here seek to draw, find your circle around themselves and their activities by simply not registering and not paying the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.884" offset="12582954">The Court now which it noted in discussing Sullivan that to honor the claim of privilege not asserted at the time to return his due would make the tax pay rather than in a tribunal, the final arbiter of the merits of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.607" offset="12629765">In Albertson, the Court found such a consideration inapplicable since the board there had an opportunity to pass on petition self-incrimination claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.101" offset="12663724">Here on the other hand, assuming that petitioner's fail to comply with the wagering tax laws because of fear of incrimination they and they alone decided at the time that they fail to comply, that they had a constitutional right not to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.801" offset="12726627">Now we recognize that the Court would not agree to hear these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.503" offset="12745435">Had it not been concerned about the continuing liability of Kahriger and Lewis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.469" offset="12769259">And should the Court disagree with our analysis with those cases and find that the registration requirement at least, that the wagering tax laws would result in compelling incriminating information so as to bring in to play the protections of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.696" offset="12830177">Then we submit, it does not necessarily follow that the entire wagering tax scheme or even the registration plan must necessarily fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.312" offset="12868629">We suggest that rather than sanctioning a failure to register and pay the taxes, the result should be to place appropriate restrictions upon the use of the information obtained as a result to compliance with the wagering tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.552" offset="12925576">As long as the information of paying --</text>

            <text syncTime="3206.650" offset="12929964">You're suggestion is that it will be done in much the same way as the income tax is kept confidential, income tax return?</text>

            <text syncTime="3219.969" offset="12983254">The income tax return information is kept confidential pursuant to statute for use except -- to assist other states in enforcing their tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.664" offset="13038007">Such a rule would be somewhat similar to that approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.016" offset="13071444">Now, so long as the information of thing is confined or used the aid of collecting taxes, no problem of self-incrimination arises, because the privilege protects against the compulsion by the government of information which can be used to convict the person of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.769" offset="13134451">If any non-tax use of the information obtained in connection with registration is prescribed, used either by the states or by the Federal Government, privilege in our view would be accorded full protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.560" offset="13185651">Such an approach would -- picking up the footnote to Justice Goldberg as we point in our brief wrote in Murphy would focus upon the time and the attempted use of such information and not the time to attempt that compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.768" offset="13250435">In our view, similar exclusionary rules have been fashioned by the Court to effectuate Fifth Amendment rights in other context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.483" offset="13277288">Just such a rule as we point out is adopted in Murphy versus Waterfront Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.570" offset="13297664">The Court there recognized that such an approach was appropriate where a separate and an independent governmental interest, not just an interest in the underlying activity alone such as now which someone is involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="4063.236" offset="16356289">This is so, because the income tax return permits reporting of the income without specific identification of source.</text>

            <text syncTime="4194.461" offset="16881246">It may apply to a few other special taxes but it's in this Section, its 6107 of Title 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="4205.485" offset="16925341">If Your Honor please, that brings us to the related issue of this nonuse rule that Mr. Justice Fortas touched upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.058" offset="16967555">The Government would not quite say, at least if they did say it orally, they were modifying their position in the brief that they were advocating a nonuse rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4225.844" offset="17006738">Because by nonuse, I believe Mr. Justice Fortas had in mind an immunity situation and the Government will not concede that in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4234.514" offset="17041429">They're very strong to emphasize that they have no objection to Mr. Marchetti being prosecuted but when a state prosecutor introduces evidence A, we then object to the introduction of evidence A and we say the United States must have given you this information, that's where you got it and therefore it must be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="4256.835" offset="17130663">That's the only rule the Government would offer us now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4260.013" offset="17143411">I say Your Honor that is no substitute for the right to remain silent which is really the cornerstone of the Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="4268.621" offset="17177893">Before these reasons Your Honor, I should add one more thought on this point Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.533" offset="17197537">Even assuming arguendo that there were some adoption by this Court of the Murphy type rule, which as I said in my main argument, it has no application whatsoever when there's no state immunity statute at issue and there's none here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4287.110" offset="17251767">There would still be no basis to affirm these convictions because the Court just as it did in Murphy should afford an opportunity to have the petitioner know the rule that is now being enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4300.959" offset="17307251">In Murphy for example, the convictions were reversed as the Court announced the new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4307.339" offset="17332746">And the same if Murphy word to be applied to this situation, the same remedy must apply and the convictions under all circumstances must be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.171" offset="17372035">For all of these reasons therefore Your Honor I respectfully request that this Court reverse the Court of Appeals.</text>
