            <text syncTime="11.628" offset="149922">Yesterday afternoon, I had just concluded a brief description of the physical area known as Duffy Square, the narrow triangular concrete island in the middle of Times Square Manhattan.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.702" offset="210213">At about 4 PM on a Saturday afternoon in August, a group of people began to congregate in front of the statue erected to -- for the Duffy in response to some 10,000 leaflets which had been distributed announcing the meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.609" offset="289834">At that hour at 4:00 PM, Mr. Lao one of the petitioners ascended the steps in front of the statue and with the use of a hand amplification device known as a bullhorn or a battery powered megaphone began to address this group which has been variously estimated at between 60 and 300 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.017" offset="391398">The group was by all accounts orderly.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.980" offset="407280">There was no evidence of any disturbance, any violence, although there was a drum that was used at some point or another during this proceedings, there was no allegation by the prosecution of any disorder by that group.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.149" offset="480005">Mr. Lao announced that this was a meeting called by an organization called May 2nd Movement and he said what the purpose was and he stated his intention to introduce chairmen and speakers and made no statement really of any consequence on the purpose or content of the -- of the meeting.</text>

            <text syncTime="119.680" offset="582092">It entirely was a group that had been formed sometime before described by one of the petitioners as a radical piece movement and for the specific purpose of protesting the American involvement in the Vietnam conflict.</text>

            <text syncTime="142.792" offset="674565">I don't know what May 2nd refers to, but the organization was founded according to the testimony Mr. Justice in March, but it was entitled the May 2nd Movement.</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Richard Uviller</label>
            <text syncTime="159.937" offset="743111">Presumably, no testimony in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.616" offset="753873">There were a quite number of them as to where they all hailed from.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.753" offset="782399">But their background was not going into extensively in the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.241" offset="804342">In any event, Mr. Lao then turned the meeting over to the man who was designated as the chairman and who subsequently testified that he was one of the organizers of this meeting, Mr. Luce who was not arrested and is not a petitioner here but did testify at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.970" offset="879261">Mr. Luce likewise only got through some preliminary statements before a police captain approached and made his first statement to the speakers and leaders of this meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.430" offset="941119">Now, there was a question raised by Mr. Fraenkel as to why this statement by the police officer was not reproduced on the recording or tape that was played and which did quite clearly indicate at the trial what each of the speakers had said to the crowd.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.981" offset="1011336">And I think the reason for this is quite obvious, the speakers who were speaking through this amplification device whereas the police officer was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.358" offset="1040802">So, the recording device which was secreted on one of the police officers who was mingling with the crowd in civilian dress, that recording device reproduced what have been said on the amplification megaphone but not what the police officer said.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.943" offset="1111124">However, his statement has been variously testified to on his first approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.394" offset="1136933">It was according to the police officers who heard it, simply that they were interfering with traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.456" offset="1169220">By this time, a description of the crowd indicates that they had moved forward crowding toward the speaker as quite not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.286" offset="1200567">This is a noisy place at that hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.476" offset="1213315">And had overlapped the two sidewalk areas on either side of the statue, 12 feet in width each and indeed some of them had spilled over from the concrete island in to the traffic lanes of Broadway in 7th Avenue that bound this so-called square.</text>

            <text syncTime="337.383" offset="1452910">According to the defendant he said, “You are not permitted to have this meeting” or “Where did you get permission for this meeting?”</text>
            <text syncTime="344.318" offset="1480600">Or “We do not allow meetings at this point”.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.023" offset="1495437">And I think I should mention at this time that the petitioner here makes a statement in his brief that there is evidence in the record that the police officer announced that there was a ban on meetings of political dissent in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.800" offset="1550608">There is absolutely no shred of evidence in anywhere in this record that there was any ban on meetings on political dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.556" offset="1577566">Indeed, there is no indication that this was a response to the content of the meeting at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.248" offset="1604315">Although there is testimony that there were placards for example displayed during the course of this meeting, there is no testimony in this record as to what was on the placards, what they said or whether the police officers perceived them or reacted to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="608.056" offset="2535633">Now, and point of the fact this Duffy Square is technically a public park, however, there was no proof in this record to that effect and indeed they were not prosecuted for having use a public park without a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.297" offset="2588609">The permit requirement by the way in New York is an automatic one, the law requires that on application a permit shall issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.545" offset="2621524">So there is no discretionary issue there.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.665" offset="2634062">In any event, the crowd was completely orderly at this time with the exception of the fact that certain individuals had spilled over into street.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.153" offset="2668022">Now, the police officers tried to move them back and they tried to open a path along the sidewalk but found that they were unable to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.535" offset="2701563">At this point, there was a second approach and under -- the second approach apparently repeated the injunction that they were obstructing vehicular traffic, pedestrian traffic and in addition, the police officer said, “You'll have to disband the meeting”.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.349" offset="2776795">Now, the question of whether or not this was a reaction to the situation as it developed or the result of a predetermined plan by the police officer was raised and indeed, the counsel -- trial counsel tried to establish that there was some sort of ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.705" offset="2846177">They say the record is not altogether clear as to whether there was a ban and if there was a ban, who had directed it or what the nature of it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.234" offset="2880345">But on the record on which these individuals were convicted, there is only the faintest hint of any such ban and if indeed there was a ban, it was simply a ban on meetings of any sort in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.647" offset="2937919">Now, there was a question yesterday, I believe, directed to Mr. Fraenkel as to whether or not there hadn't been some evidence that a police officer had offered alternative site to these individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.485" offset="2977311">Now, Mr. Fraenkel, in answering in a negative overlooked the testimony of one of his own witnesses who testified that police officer when he first came up to the leader of the group said, “Why don't you hold your meeting South of 48th Street or North of 59th Street?”</text>

            <text syncTime="1212.683" offset="4954154">But each of the defendants who is arrested in this case was one who in someway or another refused to heed the police order which have been repeated not only by the police officer who first made the direction but by the individual officers who made the arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1256.650" offset="5130010">They were charged in this complaint with three -- aside from the administrative code violations for the use of the megaphone, with three -- violation of three subdivisions of the Disorderly Conduct Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.671" offset="5178075">This is set forth in the complaint, Subdivisions 2, 3, and 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.818" offset="5194689">3 as I've indicated is the one which is failure to move and I don't think that there is any serious dispute with the conviction there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1284.839" offset="5242755">That is to say this was not a disjunctive charge, and the conviction, the general verdict of the court guilty I think should be fairly construed and this distinguishes that case from Stromberg cited by my adversary as a conjunctive charges to say, if this conviction can be sustained under any one these subdivisions, then there is no need to reverse the conviction based on the general verdict of guilty as charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.232" offset="5368351">There was as I say no disorder until the order of the police to move on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.459" offset="5397191">Now, one of these subdivisions, Subdivision 2 charges the defendants with creating a disturbance, tending to breach the peace, annoying to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.115" offset="5431881">That is the language of Subdivision 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.179" offset="5444106">And indeed it is that conviction which is principally challenged by my adversary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.369" offset="5460825">He claims that the complaint does not charge that particular offense and consequently any conviction based upon evidence as to what -- of what occurred after the order to disperse in not fairly charged in the complaint and therefore violation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.239" offset="5528325">The complaint appears itself on page 1 of the record and I think in a fair reading of it and then by the way I do think that it should be read fairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.048" offset="5559568">It is a -- an affidavit by a police officer and should be construed in harmony with the Ventresco principle indicates that not only were each of the subdivisions specified in that complaint, but the language of the complaint has one phrase at least dealing with each of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.332" offset="5636681">For example, did unlawfully congregate and assemble in the area obstructing the area to the exclusion of those wishing to use the same would indicate the reasonableness of the police order to move on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.228" offset="5696240">As to the Subdivision 3, the last phrase says when ordered to move on, the defendants did fail to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.484" offset="5729259">That is the substance of Subdivision 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.954" offset="5739186">Subdivision 2, the one that my adversary claims was not properly charged, I think is implicit in the phrase, “did delay vehicular traffic while carrying placards and using loud and boisterous language”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.008" offset="5791431">And the only allegation of loud and boisterous language was the loud and boisterous language used by the defendants after the order to move on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.141" offset="5823927">So that I say that not -- these are not mutually dependent subsections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.206" offset="5840227">In other words, even as the police ordered to move on was not a reasonable order and of course the New York courts construed it as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.195" offset="5872201">The reaction of the defendants so far exceeded the proper resistance to such an unlawful order, that it in itself became a disorderly conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.473" offset="5917236">In other words, although you are entitled to resist an unlawful order under the New York law and not move on when told unreasonably to do so, you cannot resist it in such a loud and boisterous manner as to create a breach of the peace or disturbance and annoyance to others.</text>

            <text syncTime="1484.826" offset="6042728">The court -- the only court that wrote an opinion in this case was the appellate term, the court of first review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.562" offset="6069582">And that court in a long opinion found that implicit in this complaint was the charge of the actions occurring after the order to disperse because it was charged that the defendants failed to move on when directed to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.934" offset="6139068">That is really I think the principal point which is being made by my adversary, one of pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.360" offset="6168848">I do not think that he can seriously contend that there was in this instance any reaction so long condemned by this Court to the content of the speech or an attempt to break up the meeting because the views being expressed were unpopular with the police or with the society the police represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.433" offset="6261112">This is indeed, I think, a pure instance of the type of situation which this Court I believe has in an unbroken line of authority and virtually every member of the court who has written on this subject has agreed is a proper police function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.186" offset="6320149">And that is that the police have the right to regulate the manner of expression of speech consistent with the interests of society in maintaining free thoroughfare and the free use of the streets to those wishing to engage in ordinary commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.573" offset="6397680">I do not think there can be any doubt at this point that such regulation of the manner, time, and place are expression of ideas or assembling does not constitute any First Amendment infringement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1603.220" offset="6516276">Well, there is actually one division of Subdivision of 722 of Disorderly Conduct does Subdivision 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.220" offset="6552221">One of those that the defendants was convicted of states that anyone who by his actions, tending to breach the peace, causes the crowd to collect other than while lawfully addressing a crowd is guilty of disorderly conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.210" offset="6612198">Now, that Subdivision 4 may be still in this case and it may not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.126" offset="6627871">It was never considered by any of the lower courts writing on it -- on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.720" offset="6646262">And indeed it has not been construed by our highest court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.959" offset="6659218">So we have not relied on that statute nor has the defendant attacked the constitutionality of that statute on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.510" offset="6685445">That is the only statute that makes any specific reference to an address to a public assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.356" offset="6712822">In this instance, New York by -- by statute does leave to the police the discretion to decide when there has been an interference with vehicular traffic and that discretion is reviewable under the New York construction of 722 that his judgment must be reasonable under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.789" offset="6798503">Consequently, the statute on its face must be read in conjunction with the construing sections to limit this discretion to a reasonable order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.668" offset="6850017">And I submit to the Court that as applied in this instance, we have a clear example of a reasonable order in the interest of vehicular and pedestrian free passage of where the police simply tried to convey and contain the group and when they fail to do so, to disperse the group which was a traffic menace, and did so without any regard to the content or substance of abuse that were being expressed, unlike the Feiner case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.855" offset="6978748">I think that element is out of this case altogether.</text>

            <text syncTime="1725.066" offset="7003617">Just a few brief remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.382" offset="7008946">In the first place, I think that Mr. Uviller is incorrect when he states that when the police captain and the inspector for the first time approach the speakers, they did not order the meeting to disperse, that only police officer who testified clearly on that subject was Officer Bear and at page 9 of the record, he says, “Are you giving your best to the court?</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.777" offset="7114480">Are you giving your best recollection, the substance of what was said by the witness as correct?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.506" offset="7133393">And then an objection was overruled and then the witness continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.524" offset="7145514">That in view of this interference with pedestrian and the vehicular traffic, that the meeting would have to be terminated at this location at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.321" offset="7176652">So that was an order to terminate the meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.158" offset="7188041">Now, that happened about two minutes after the meeting started as the Court will see, as the Court reads to itself aloud the recording which is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.909" offset="7234957">Moreover, I think Mr. Uviller --</text>

            <text syncTime="1798.537" offset="7297546">But he didn't do that until he approach them the second time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1813.908" offset="7358986">Now according to the -- disinterested witness, Mr. Lutherfield he did not mentioned vehicular traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.454" offset="7381138">Now, it is also I think erroneous to say that the police had tried to get to people off -- the few people who were on the roadway off it, because two police officers were specifically questioned on that subject, whether they made any attempt to get to go back on the sidewalk and then both said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.891" offset="7466924">Now, one other thing, we are not claiming only that certain of these subdivisions should be disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.918" offset="7527006">We are claiming basically and that's my first -- my humble judgment, my main point in this case that this complaint did not indicate that there was any intention of charging these people with the acts which I can conceded yesterday were to some extent unlawful in resisting the order to disperse because the whole complaint proceeds on the basis that the police officers had told them to stop because the meeting was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.341" offset="7676740">And our contention basically is that the meeting up to that point was not unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.834" offset="7702758">And that if there was any desire to prosecute any of these individuals for the wrongful things they did afterward, they should have been separately prosecuted for those because that was not a joint venture or a joint effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.861" offset="7758764">It was the reaction of the separate individuals according to their own temperaments to the situation that existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.956" offset="7799202">So it is not merely a matter of pleading in technical sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.573" offset="7813622">It's a matter of the fair intendment of a complaint putting the people unnoticed of what they were being charged with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.395" offset="7840998">And here, we submit, they were charged in the holding on an unlawful meeting and there was at that time no unlawful meeting because we insist that there was no substantial evidence of interference with traffic up to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.887" offset="7898885">The real interference of this traffic came afterward when the meeting spread out, people ran all over, the cars stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.908" offset="7942980">Up to that point, all that happened was that a few people were in the roadway and that some cars had to move to avoid those few people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.380" offset="7980910">Now, that's something that happens in New York all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.243" offset="7992299">People cross the streets, cars have to swerve to avoid the people crossing the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.520" offset="8017481">That's not an interference with traffic in any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.936" offset="8031065">It justifies in my opinion the ending of a lawful meeting.</text>
