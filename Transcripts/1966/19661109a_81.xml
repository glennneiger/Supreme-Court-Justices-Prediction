            <text syncTime="85.304" offset="444583">The facts in the case are not -- I believe in any dispute whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.826" offset="470706">This petitioner was once tried for first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.837" offset="482722">He was convicted of second degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.693" offset="494111">That conviction was set aside by the Oregon Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.698" offset="514173">A new trial was had in which the event occurred which brings the case to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.986" offset="535280">That new trial again resulted in a conviction for second degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.285" offset="556492">Petitioner was sentenced to life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.941" offset="571120">That conviction was subsequently affirmed by the Oregon Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.741" offset="590346">After that affirmance petitioner instituted pursuant to Oregon Statute a post-conviction hearing in which he alleged a number of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.699" offset="626186">And in which he proved that in the words of the trial court and -- or the hearing court I should say, I'm reading page 197 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.839" offset="674774">That the bailiff of the State of Oregon said to three jurors, two or three jurors in effect, “Oh, that wicked fellow.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.321" offset="700688">He is guilty”, and also said to them, “If you find him guilty and there's anything wrong, the Supreme Court will correct it”.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.381" offset="736946">Now in spite of that odd language, there was the finding made by the hearing court that those things were in fact said -- that they were in fact said to two or three jurors.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.195" offset="800162">It is that that bailiff had the jury in charge for an eight-day trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.802" offset="818552">The hearing court went on to find, I think, he didn't have to but he went on to find that these facts in fact had prejudice to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.630" offset="849899">And consistently with that finding, he ordered that the conviction be set aside and a new trial be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.403" offset="876962">The Oregon Supreme Court reversed that finding by the hearing court and affirmed the conviction and reversed the new trial ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.320" offset="928684">At that appeal, the state's appeal on the -- on that hearing court's ruling, the federal question was explicitly raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.338" offset="960763">There's no contention made here that the petitioner did not raise the federal question in the Oregon Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.790" offset="986572">The Oregon Supreme Court decision cannot be read in my judgment in any way other than to say in effect that petitioner was afforded a Fourteenth Amendment trial in spite of the fact that an officer of the State of Oregon in effect went into the jury room and told two or three jurors the defendant was guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.218" offset="1064208">I don't see how the Supreme Court of Oregon decisions to be interpreted in any way and on that interpretation I submit that citations of authority of this Court's prior decisions is almost completely unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.994" offset="1119378">If citation is authority, I should like to call to Your Honors attention the case of Turner versus Louisiana which you decided two terms ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.719" offset="1154278">And in Turner, you may recall that was an 8 to 1 decision with only Justice Clark dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.404" offset="1176952">In Turner, two sheriffs who had custody of the jury also testified for the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.929" offset="1211120">And this Court held and on those facts and without more that that was the kind of situation which was so inherently prejudicial to the defendant that it was not consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment obligations on the states.</text>

            <label>Mr. John H. Schafer</label>
            <text syncTime="304.314" offset="1320626">That's correct Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.096" offset="1327731">Let me say however, in response to Mr. Chief Justice Warren's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.294" offset="1344554">In theory, you had only a three-day trial which those bailiffs or sheriffs were in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.044" offset="1363571">Here you have an eight-day trial and this bailiff was in constant and intimate contact with that jury for eight solid days.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.411" offset="1393037">The bailiff then said to the jurors “this defendant is guilty”.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.623" offset="1409860">Moreover, you have here flat proof of finding a fact made by the hearing court that prejudicial statements were made by the state officer and in turn you hadn't -- didn't have any evidence of that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.680" offset="1478092">And moreover I think I may fairly say that in this case the jurors deliberated for 26 hours and I think that can fairly be said to indicate some real questions about the ultimate question of guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.654" offset="1549981">Now, the state's arguments in support of this holding of the Oregon Supreme Court are I believe without any merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.102" offset="1587806">The state first suggests that finality ought to be accorded to jury verdicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.893" offset="1618944">But there isn't any rule in the State of Oregon which would enshrine jury verdicts to this extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.632" offset="1649873">The State versus Gardner decision of the Oregon Supreme Court a few terms ago very recently in Oregon, lays down the general rule that's been applied in most jurisdictions that that evidence of this kind is admissible to impeach a jury verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.000" offset="1723329">That evidence of the reasoning process, the thought process of jurors that's not admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.971" offset="1747257">But evidence of overt acts which can be proved or disproved by other witnesses, that kind of evidence is admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.702" offset="1774216">That's the law of Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.353" offset="1780799">Mr. Justice Brennan when he was on the New Jersey Supreme Court wrote a very detailed and considerate opinion in which basically he came to the same result to the State of New Jersey and that's the general rule and some of the rule of Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.219" offset="1836283">And there isn't the kind of rule of finality which the state would now have you believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.576" offset="1865644">And moreover mind you, in this case, the evidence of the bailiff statements did come from jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.878" offset="1894902">Three jurors testified to the effect these statements were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.897" offset="1910993">But the state never suggested that that evidence because it came from jurors was inadmissible that these jurors were impeaching their verdict and they could not be heard to impeach their verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.488" offset="1953311">That's not the State Rule in Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.174" offset="1964074">The hearing court didn't suggest that and the Oregon Supreme Court didn't suggest that.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.605" offset="1985808">And moreover, I would say that I think it's quite clear that if this were this rule of Oregon and if this rule were applied to foreclose proof and judicial actions thereon and it may -- suggested by the State, they will be unconstitutionally applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="541.827" offset="2270647">The State in its brief in a way I'm not quite sure I can definitely state to the Court is suggesting two lines of argument and seems to combine the two into an ultimate conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.095" offset="2315786">In other words, it's suggesting the argument of finality which I've just -- been suggesting myself to.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.677" offset="2334072">And there is also just saying in effect which I want to come to in a second, but anyway there wasn't any prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.211" offset="2356224">And then the State in his brief says, what the State -- the Court in Oregon did was to balance these two, and say, we ought to have finality and it really wasn't very much prejudice, so it's all okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.648" offset="2393945">And I'm just taking the two points made by the State in his brief and analyzing separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.329" offset="2412648">Now as they say, the finality argument I think this without a merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.543" offset="2425501">And the State as I have said goes on to say, “Well, anyway there wasn't any prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.227" offset="2444309">There wasn't any prejudice here to this defendant”.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.171" offset="2456012">And there are three things wrong with that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.567" offset="2469595">The first is as I've said the hearing court found as in fact there was prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.597" offset="2489762">And the second thing wrong with it is, there is a long line of decisions of this Court making it perfectly clear we submit that in circumstances such as this, it isn't necessary for a defendant to assume the burden of proving actual prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.508" offset="2549426">This Court's decision starting with Tumey versus Ohio running through Turner and Louisiana including Irvin v. Dowd, Estes, Sheppard; all those cases established the proposition that where the circumstances are as here so inherently prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.732" offset="2622255">It isn't necessary in order to establish a constitutional right that the defendant assumed the burden of proving actual prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.468" offset="2657259">And finally on this argument of prejudice, I would say simply that the State's argument proves too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.444" offset="2681187">It would have us prove that Mr. Parker was prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.462" offset="2693204">Where the only way left to prove it would be to have a juror come in and say, ”Yes, I was in fact influenced by what that bailiff told me about his guilt”.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.439" offset="2733119">Well, that's precisely the kind of testimony of course that almost everybody agrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.656" offset="2754017">The rules of -- uniform rules of evidence and everybody else agrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.885" offset="2766869">That kind of evidence is not admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.161" offset="2784005">So that for those reasons, I don't plan to talk any longer unless there are questions, for those reasons, we believe the State's arguments are without any merit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1227.945" offset="5015176">Mr. Parker was tried about eight years ago on the charge of first degree murder and the jury came back with a verdict of second degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.718" offset="5058226">Now, this was appealed, reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.386" offset="5072959">Second trial was held in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.907" offset="5091035">The trial began on Monday April 24th, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.146" offset="5107963">It recessed for the weekend on Saturday and Sunday and it came back the following week.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.416" offset="5145057">And the jury returned its verdict on May 3rd, 1961 which was a Wednesday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.817" offset="5178598">Now, the second trial was before a different judge, a different bailiff, and of course a different jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.921" offset="5215065">Now, he was convicted the second time of second degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.338" offset="5236694">He moved for a new trial on the basis of a failure of the prosecution who approved the venue in the county.</text>

            <text syncTime="1295.723" offset="5286222">He appealed again and the basis of the appeal was the failure of the trial court to bring in a new trial on the failure to approve venue again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.581" offset="5329690">And also a -- an objection to an opening statement of District Attorney alluding to a tape recording which are not later allowed in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.660" offset="5361977">Now, this time the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed the conviction on October 8th, 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.734" offset="5390294">Now at that time, Mr. Parker and his wife, the petitioner in this case, petitioner Mr. Parker embarked upon a campaign to get another trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.945" offset="5435120">Mr. Parker wrote letters to the jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.656" offset="5449958">He had his wife contact the jurors on the jury list and from the first juror call found the names of other jurors that were holdouts in this 26-hour deliberation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.850" offset="5514742">Now, Mr. Parker prepared a tape recording.</text>

            <text syncTime="1369.880" offset="5582869">They had a discussion of the matter and went down to see an attorney that was hred by the petitioner's wife and talk it over with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.032" offset="5615470">He prepared the affidavits and on that basis he submitted a post-conviction petition under the Oregon Post-Conviction Hearing Act in which they alleged a wide variety of misconduct on the part of the jurors, the other jurors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1404.940" offset="5723094">Now, the post-conviction hearing had all the jurors testified including the bailiffs and the two alternate jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.446" offset="5809194">Now the -- and there're still a little confusion here as to whether three jurors heard these two remarks, there were two remarks, one was, “Oh, that wicked fellow, he is surely guilty”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.734" offset="5854333">The other one was, “If there's anything wrong with your decision the Supreme Court of Oregon will correct it”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.352" offset="5884740">Now as to the remark by the bailiff that the petitioner was guilty, this was made to the alternate juror, a woman, and was overheard by a regular juror from the record indicates that she was the longest holdout.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.229" offset="5984319">The other remark was supposedly made to a man juror with all the men on the jury testified post-conviction, they didn't hear the other remark.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.968" offset="6023293">This remark supposedly was overheard by another woman juror and the other woman juror who had been the principal holdout.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.228" offset="6056312">Now the remarks were made during a walk that the jurors took on a Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.741" offset="6090376">They were out getting some fresh air and the woman alternate juror expressed concern that the petitioner's case, Mr. Parker is being rerouted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1548.756" offset="6298415">Now, the post-conviction trial court found also that if these remarks have been brought to the attention of the trial judge he would on his own motion have allowed a new trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1596.652" offset="6489945">Now, the Post-Conviction Hearing Act in Oregon requires a higher standard than the case law regarding motions for new trial that requires a substantial denial of constitutional right.</text>
