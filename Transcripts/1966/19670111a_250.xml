            <text syncTime="39.995" offset="263398">Mr. Chief Justice, this is a capital case that comes to this Court on habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.298" offset="336541">Relief was granted by the District Court of the Northern District of Illinois, Judge Perry, the state took an appeal and the Seventh Circuit reversed and this Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.718" offset="390248">There are four principal errors that we contend occurred in this trial and I'm going to try cover the four.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.577" offset="433716">The case is unique, Your Honors, and that the covenants on exonerating this petitioner of the crime was discovered even before the petitioner himself was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.990" offset="499336">The -- the petitioner was convicted of murder and on Saturday afternoon, November 26th, 1955 in Canton, Illinois at 4:00 in the afternoon and a little eight year old girl was found under a mining car severely injured but still living.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.919" offset="591078">She was rushed to a hospital where she dies at 5:47 P.M. that afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.943" offset="615111">At 6:20, while the body was still on the operating table, the coroner arrived and he performed an examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.005" offset="651368">Now, the coroner himself was a physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.364" offset="664848">In the course of that examination, he took a vaginal smear and there had been a sex attack on this child and he took the smear and the vaginal smear was sealed in a vial with a surgical tape and this smear together with a mass of other evidence was immediately taken to Springfield which was few miles away and it was taken to the state crime laboratory there.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.615" offset="801834">When it arrived there, the man in-charge, a man by the name of Forest literally, had found the vial and it was still sealed and it had on it Janice May, the name of the victim and the date of the crime November 26th, 1955 and the initials of the coroner.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.262" offset="900472">He opened the vial and inside was a tissue which he examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.113" offset="923773">And when he made a close examination, he found that there was a single strand of hair that was adhering to the tissue.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.170" offset="972048">The petitioner Lloyd Eldon Miller was arrested the following day on November the 29th, at about six o'clock -- no about eight o'clock in the evening, on a Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.344" offset="1024711">The crime took place on Saturday and he was arrested on Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.445" offset="1041115">He was immediately taken to Springfield which was the same place for the state crime laboratory was located and he -- they took him up to the crime laboratory and they took blood sample and this and that and other things and among -- there are other examinations, they took a sample of his pubic hairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.711" offset="1118229">And immediately after that, on the night of the November the 29th, they had an extensive period of interrogation which lasted I believe until one in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.040" offset="1159502">He was taken back to his cell on the following night, the night of the 30th, there was another extensive period of examination and he signed a confession shortly after midnight on Wednesday evening which was the second night of the examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.444" offset="1229197">Now, he was tried in Carthage Illinois, in September of 1956 and which was about eight months -- ten months afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.688" offset="1278098">And in May, which was several months before the -- before the trial, the -- his then defense attorneys, we were not representing him at the time, filed a motion on the trial court asking, I believe, to make a physical examination of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.274" offset="1356466">And the state came in and they resisted that, and the trial court denied the motion, and they preserved the error in the record and the Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed the denial of the right to make a physical examination of the evidence and the -- they affirmed the conviction.</text>
