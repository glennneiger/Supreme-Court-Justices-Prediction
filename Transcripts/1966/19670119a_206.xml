            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Let's get to the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2.250" offset="112410">Number 206, Houston Insulation Contractors Association, Petitioner, versus National Labor Relations Board, Number 413, National Labor Relations Board versus Houston Insulation Contractors Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.797" offset="190568">Mr. Deakins, you may proceed with your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_d_deakins_jr" startTime="25.352" stopTime="636.190">
            <label>Mr. W. D. Deakins, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="25.352" offset="204779">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.978" offset="219303">This is a case in 206, it's similar in many respect to the Frouge case.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.745" offset="246366">I think, however, this is a case that points up the fallacy in Mr. Manoli's argument this morning with reference to the determination of the dominant motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.890" offset="286908">You'll recall that he said in answer to questions by the Court, in discussing the evil sought to be cured by the passage of Section 8 (b) (4) that that was a case where products of a nonunion employer or an employer has a dispute with a union are sought to be boycotted and he said -- and that is Sand Door.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.701" offset="394219">Now the target, Mr. Manoli said, is the product of another dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.082" offset="423685">He said the employees of a union employer have no dispute with her own employer and seek to prevent the products of a nonunion employer from being installed and that is where Sand Door comes into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.286" offset="480528">I say that there -- it's not necessary that there'd be a dispute because the dominant motive according to the decisions of this Court, and as I read the statute does not control.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.887" offset="534967">In this case, the petitioner in 206 is a group of contractors who formed an association that have bargained with Local 22 affiliated with the International Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and Asbestos workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.240" offset="608319">They entered into a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.126" offset="619917">The contract contains two important provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.105" offset="639770">Article VI says that the employer agrees that he will not sublet or contract out any work described by Article XIII.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.383" offset="672893">In turn, Article XIII states that it covers rates of pay rule, working conditions of all mechanics and improvers in the preparation, distribution, and application of -- I will generalize this, insulation materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.000" offset="735378">Now in connection with the interpretation which the union has placed on this contract, they have picked the word preparation which they say is jobsite work that they're entitled to have and that when the two members of the association purchased materials from all jobsite, nonunion suppliers that the company violated that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.851" offset="858781">Now what occurred was that Johns-Manville, one of the members of the Association had a job at Texas City, Texas on a construction project.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.877" offset="894830">In fact, both of these are construction projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.923" offset="907055">They have purchased some precut metal bands that hold aluminum jacketing around piping in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.591" offset="937775">And when they were delivered of the jobsite, the union refused to apply them.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.541" offset="953553">Of course, they didn't have a decal or label attached to the box to show as I will adopt that they were union made.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.425" offset="993050">Armstrong was working in Victoria, Texas under the jurisdiction of Local 13 of the same union but the contract -- there was no contract in effect between Local 113 and the Association or Armstrong, either one.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.139" offset="1067969">When Armstrong purchased some pre-mitered asbestos fittings to be applied to joints of pipes, those fittings were not applied by the union because they were -- did not vary union labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.314" offset="1140590">Now, as soon as that occurred, of course charges were filed and a complaint was issued, and an injunction secured in the United States District Court of Houston.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.456" offset="1185207">At the hearing on the Board case, certain evidence was introduced which we think was mostly important in this case and which brings about our first point which lies under Universal Camera case but let me tell the Court first what occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.122" offset="1271829">The current examiner held that the refusal to handle the products of Techalloy and Thorpe, the two nonunion off jobsites suppliers was unlawful because the exemption of Section 8 (e) applied only to be worked -- to work to be done at the jobsite, and not the materials manufactured off the jobsite and ship there for installation.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.288" offset="1360541">He said also, even if this work and the application of the products had been jobsite construction work, they refuse to handle these products was unlawful under Sand Door.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.539" offset="1417488">So he held that the International Union was not involved in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.092" offset="1447790">The Board then reviewed this decision and held that the strike in each case was for work preservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.476" offset="1481226">And thus, the strikes were primary and not unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.347" offset="1500766">It did not deal with the implications of Section 8 (e) in this case and the court below speciically pointed that fact up.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.392" offset="1536920">So when we went to the court below, the Court agreed with the Board that the activity of Local 22, that was the Local with which there was a contract, was not unlawful because it engaged in work preservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.912" offset="1619048">It held that Local 113, that's the one at Corpus Christi, was not engaged in work preservation because it had no contract with the Association or Armstrong, and held that it was guilty of an 8 (b) (4) violation because it got an innocent third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.488" offset="1697311">And that's Thorpe who manufactured the pre-mitered fittings involved in a labor dispute not of its own making.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.396" offset="1732942">Now, we believe that this entire case is dependent to quite an extent on certain testimony that was given by an International vice president of the union who is also the Secretary of Local 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.280" offset="1816534">His name is Baker.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.553" offset="1825625">The International's attorney called him and put him on their stand as their witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.804" offset="1850598">And here was the questions in this very brief by Mr. (Inaudible), the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.943" offset="1867107">“Has your local instructed its members not to use the products of Thorpe?”</text>
            <text syncTime="445.129" offset="1883930">The answer is “yes”.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.468" offset="1889259">“Alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.055" offset="1891558">Under all circumstances?”</text>
            <text syncTime="448.694" offset="1898141">Answer, “Yes, as far as I know.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.219" offset="1908276">Question, “Is the same true of Techalloy?”</text>
            <text syncTime="453.394" offset="1916949">Answer, “Yes, as far as I know.”</text>
            <text syncTime="456.730" offset="1930324">Alright -- question, “Alright!</text>
            <text syncTime="458.605" offset="1937742">And why have you instructed your local members to take those positions?”</text>
            <text syncTime="463.689" offset="1958118">Answer, “We are not in agreement with Thorpe or Techalloy”.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.025" offset="1975463">Now his attorneys sensing that this was a bad statement interposed and said, “Well perhaps you misunderstood my question, Mr. Baker.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.420" offset="2009004">Let me rephrase it,” but the trial examiner interrupted and said, “You mean because you have no contract with them?”</text>
            <text syncTime="485.838" offset="2046725">Answer, “No contract, no.”</text>
            <text syncTime="488.632" offset="2057906">Now it's true that this same witness later stated that it would be a violation of the contract to apply these materials but I say this is what Mr. Manoli was talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.801" offset="2114539">Who's going to pick what unlawful object is the dominant unlawful object?</text>
            <text syncTime="509.827" offset="2142647">There wasn't any dispute that we know of with these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.073" offset="2163649">The off jobsite, nonunion suppliers which we think are covered by Section 8 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="523.042" offset="2195519">At least it wasn't an active dispute but that isn't required under Sand Door or the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.560" offset="2221641">As we view this case, Denver Building Trades really controls the question of what's the dominant, what's the non-dominant purpose?</text>
            <text syncTime="538.521" offset="2257481">In that case, this Court held that if there was one unlawful object, the entire strike was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.786" offset="2282559">And we think that's the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.096" offset="2291754">Now the Fifth Circuit considered this matter and the general counsel was hard put to explain away this testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.802" offset="2338565">I suspect because for the first time in their brief to the Court of Appeals, they said Mr. Baker's testimony was confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.550" offset="2369599">Well Mr. Baker never said it was confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.704" offset="2378167">He never said he misunderstood the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.338" offset="2388720">He never said that his answer was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.619" offset="2401886">He didn't deny this at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.134" offset="2411917">We think that is evidence of a motive which this Court should have considered below.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.259" offset="2440443">Now the Board suggests and they think from the text of Universal Camera, that part where this Court was admonishing the Courts of Appeals of the requirement for canvassing the record as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.102" offset="2495822">They took that part to court, it said the Court may not displace the Board's view between two fairly conflicting views even though the Court would justifiably have made a different choice, had the matter been before de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.277" offset="2556531">Now, I submit this witness doesn't have too fairly conflicting views.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.277" offset="2580459">He's a one man.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.022" offset="2587460">He's a high official with this union.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.907" offset="2594983">He stated two objectives of two objects, to motives of this refusal to handle these products, one unlawful or certain under Sand Door.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.741" offset="2638346">The other unlawful we think under the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1130.925" offset="4627101">It's bind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.408" offset="4637027">Now the central question in this case is similar to that which was argued by Mr. Mahin and that's whether the amendment date (b) (4) (b) which saves primary strikes and primary picketing from the prescriptions of the balance of the Section can be construed to permit a union to claim work preservation under a subcontracted clause and thus avoid that part of Section 8 (e) which limit subcontracting provisions to the work to be formed -- performed at the site of the construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.651" offset="4761997">The best indication that I think of the intent of Congress is seen from the plain language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.933" offset="4787075">Now, the plain language of the statute and of the exception limits that the work to be performed at the site of the construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.799" offset="4822601">That statute does not say, work which could be performed at the site of this construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.662" offset="4846007">And as a matter of fact, in the legislative history, the day when the Bill was sent to the President for signature, Senator McNamara entered a statement in which he claimed that in the plumbing and pipefitting trade, there was a situation where there was a lot of prefabricating, and that this statute was intended to cover prefabricating that was done off the jobsite but Representative Kearns who was on the House Report and we've discussed all of this extensively in our brief, answered that pretty well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.119" offset="5011832">He quoted from Senator John Kennedy who was really the principal author of this Bill, and Senator Kennedy said four things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.312" offset="5052583">He said 8 (e) was intended to preserve the present state of the law with reference to -- with respect to picketing at the site of the construction project and to the validity of agreements relating to work to be performed at the site of the construction project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.941" offset="5111097">That the law developed under Section 8 (b) (4) was unaffected and the Denver Building Trades and Sand Door remained enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.485" offset="5145266">He said third, the contracts not to subcontract work on a construction site are legal since the provision of Section 8 (e) does not relate to Section 8 (b) (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.766" offset="5186435">Strikes and picketing to enforce the contract accepted by the provisions will continue to be illegal under Section 8 (b) (4) whenever Sand Door is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.204" offset="5224155">He also said it should be particularly noted that this provides or relates only to the contracting or subcontracting of work to be done at the site of the construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.207" offset="5260204">This provides or does not cover boycotts of goods manufactured in an industrial plant for insulation at the jobsite or the supplier who do not work at the jobsite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.523" offset="5305448">Since the advent of this and fairly recently, a case which we cited on page 24 and 25 of our brief is the NLRB versus the Teamsters at 342 F. 2d 18, involved the contract containing a site work clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.272" offset="5384443">And they were hauling ready mixed concrete into this plant to be forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.611" offset="5417775">The Board held that this was off jobsite work and that the continuous mixing was still work that was part of delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.259" offset="5468453">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.189" offset="5472110">It seems to me a little suspicious to hold that because the mixing was continuing even when the concrete got to the jobsite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.011" offset="5511398">And if that was part of the delivery, it seems to be stretching a point quite a bit because the work was continued but they did hold that this was off jobsite work and I think that squares somewhat with our situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.167" offset="5580048">Now probably the strongest statement made in -- other than that of Senator Kennedy in support of our case was that by Senator Morris.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.478" offset="5629262">He was a better opponent to this Bill and here's what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.613" offset="5645876">It would prevent a union from protecting the installation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.680" offset="5662072">It would prevent a union from protecting the bargaining unit it represents by obtaining an agreement not to subcontract work normally performed by the employees of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.044" offset="5707525">If that is what the Congress intended, I think that has answered a lot of questions that have been asked here of Mr. Mahin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.537" offset="5753501">Now Sand Door, of course, involved a precise situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.262" offset="5772413">If the Court agrees with our first point here, because one of the stated objectives was to stop the handling of the goods of a Wisconsin fabricator, not because he was from Wisconsin but because they checked up and found that they weren't union made products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.854" offset="5846810">And I think that that, under this testimony that we have given here is exactly what our case is because that is not work that could be performed that's covered under Section 8 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.770" offset="5882441">That is work that was performed off the jobsite by what has been said by Mr. Kennedy and others to be a nonunion off jobsite supplier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.821" offset="5958614">The conference report as well, Representative Kearns says -- supports this view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.785" offset="5990484">He -- and to quote him, he said, -- he states at page 39 that the proviso in question relates only and exclusively to the contracting or subcontracting of work to be done at the site of the construction and that it does not exempt from Section 8 (e) agreement relating to supply the materials, ship to the site of the construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.521" offset="6069478">He also said that the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare in its section by section analysis statement with respect to the section in question that the prohibition against hot cargo agreement does not apply the construction industry relating to work to be done at the site of the construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1803.044" offset="7315519">At the threshold we have what is really a substantial evidence question as to whether or not, the substantial evidence to support the Board's finding that the union in the two instances were induced -- the refusals to handle the Thorpe and the Techalloy products had only a work preservation object to whether as Mr. Deakins is trying to suggest, they had a dual object.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.079" offset="7455640">Now the Board found and that -- and the relevant Board finding is on page 201 of the record that upon the entire record, we cannot agree with the general counsel that the respondent Locals were engaged in a boycott of nonunion products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.499" offset="7553337">And the Board indicates in a footnote that even the trial examiner so found even though he went on to find the violation on some other ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.645" offset="7589909">While Techalloy and Thorpe were nonunion employers, either Local 22 and on Local 113 had ever refused to apply their products before the incidents in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.793" offset="7646542">It did so only in the two instances where Johns-Manville and Armstrong had the products prefabricated thereby depriving the Armstrong and Johns-Manville employees of work that they would otherwise be doing so that the --</text>

            <text syncTime="1916.050" offset="7767542">The -- there are two products involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.950" offset="7791156">There's an aluminum band that would be fastened around insulation material to hold it on pipes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.032" offset="7847476">Now cut traditionally, Johns-Manville bought this aluminum tubing in a roll.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.419" offset="7901080">That tubing would then be cut into bands by the Johns-Manville employees in the Johns-Manville shop in Houston.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.650" offset="7969938">They would do that even though Techalloy from whom the tubing was purchased was a nonunion employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.200" offset="8024168">What would happen then after the Johns-Manville employee in the shop would do the work, he would put a label which is like a posted stamp on the pipe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.051" offset="8075577">And that label would have a serial number so that when the bands arrived at the jobsite, the Johns-Manville employees there by checking with the union business agent who had a list of the serial numbers, could determine whether or not that pipe had been finished in -- had been finished by Johns-Manville employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.660" offset="8230013">Now the Board found and the court below sustained the Board finding that this label or decal, although sometimes referred to as a union label, served only the purpose of enabling the union, Local 22 being the principal union here to police the no subcontracting provision of the contract which it had with Johns-Manville and Armstrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.853" offset="8378807">And this, no subcontracting provision as Mr. Deakins has indicated, flatly barred the contracting out of certain specified work including the preparation and application of pipe and boiler coverings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.429" offset="8469086">And the record shows that in the past where both Armstrong and Thorpe had consistently followed the practice of letting the Johns-Manville and Armstrong employees do the finishing work on the tubing, the other product happened to be insulation covering and the finishing work involved was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.300" offset="8620596">Customarily, Armstrong would buy that in links and its shop employees would miter it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.438" offset="8657168">In other words, they would cut some of it at angles and glue it together so that it could fit as I understand over the corners of certain -- of the pipes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.265" offset="8704397">In the past when this finishing work had been done by the Johns-Manville and Armstrong employees, the union had shop -- the site employees of Johns-Manville and Armstrong had installed these products even though as I've indicated, Thorpe and Techalloy were nonunion manufacturers</text>

            <text syncTime="2272.265" offset="9192469">There was a third instance where -- involving Armstrong, where it didn't come to the job with the decal but the union on checking found out that it had actually been finished in an arm -- in Armstrong shop and when it got a letter from Armstrong saying that it was finished, they didn't refuse -- I mean, they then proceeded to install it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.070" offset="9299675">So we're talking about two instances over a long period in time, the only two instances in which Armstrong and Johns-Manville got the products prefinished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.769" offset="9362474">Those two instances, the union induced Johns-Manville and Armstrong employees on the job not to handle them because they were in violation of the no subcontracting provision of the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="2993.238" offset="12076283">Of course, the most common example of that is the Teamsters who were involved in that kind of thing whereas other unions like those in the construction trades here, who when they lose work, it ends up in a product are powerless to protect themselves against it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3046.366" offset="12288815">But the point is -- the point that we're making is that this statute 8 -- that -- and that Congress neither in 1947 nor in 1959, undertook to resolve that problem into the secondary boycott provisions or the hot cargo provisions of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3546.052" offset="14287600">Secondly, Senator Kennedy and Representative Thompson were talking about the Bill which at the time it went to the conference did not have any proviso of protecting primary activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3681.373" offset="14828857">It's our position that what Congress was aiming at there was to preserve for the construction industry certain agreements that were secondary in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.779" offset="14878490">The most common form is the kind that you had in the Denver Building Trades case where the general contractor enters into the union, a contract that he shall employ only the union subcontractors on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.091" offset="14935751">Now, that agreement is a secondary agreement because the -- that this Court held in Denver that the subs are independent entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.359" offset="14964799">And now, under 8 (e) without the proviso, that kind of an agreement would be illegal in the construction industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.195" offset="15012133">Originally, they wanted to go further and permit not only that kind of an agreement, but a strike to enforce it, in other words, completely overruled Denver Building.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.214" offset="15048182">They weren't able to get that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.053" offset="15059571">They drew the line at continuing to permit the agreement of the illegal but not let the construction industry enforce it by strike pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.296" offset="15104606">And the significance of limiting it to onsite work is that they didn't want to permit the construction industry, however, to use that proviso for the purpose of unionizing suppliers who happen to deliver stuff to the jobsite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.476" offset="15181302">And -- but that is not this case because this product here or “these products” if you may call them as such, were not disfavored for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.592" offset="15221739">As I pointed out, the record is perfectly clear that the union handled them when the finishing work was left for their shop employees to perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.429" offset="15281089">Now, there's another issue in the case which I do not have time to deal with for the reasons that we've indicated in our brief, on that, a part of the case we submit that the Court here in finding that the activity by the sister union was secondary since it was confined to the primary employer who was not a neutral, that activity was likewise primary activity.</text>
