            <text syncTime="1274.790" offset="5202526">But for the vesting of their debtors' property, they would presumably have been able to pursue ordinary remedies against the debtors and they gave the debtors these opportunities and there is not one word, and I make this is very, very significant, there's not one word suggesing that they were giving up their sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.944" offset="5283192">And I respectfully suggest that they didn't give up their sovereign immunity because they didn't have it to start with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.665" offset="5306075">This was sovereign liability because this was property taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.093" offset="5327705">This was property taken from residents here who had -- who at that time were not able to be citizens as Your Honors suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.112" offset="5367829">Finally, I do not suggest that once a waiver -- I do not suggest that there's one way or another on the final question which is involved in yesterday's case, the Crown Coat case which finished this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.180" offset="5432090">We don't have to go that far but I don't see any reason why you don't have the -- why -- there should be a rule even in general principles that there isn't a tolling against the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.068" offset="5483604">I don't see any reason why the Government should suddenly get out of tolling just because it is the Government estoppel and tolling once Congress waives immunity, there's no evidence it wants to waive a little bit and not give them the full benefit of the tolling and the estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.730" offset="5562284">Now, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time and simply suggest that we have here made an overwhelming case on the equitable and estoppel and tolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.592" offset="5621739">The only question that arises whether the Government gets special treatment of getting out of that and I see no reason where a constitutional issue arises or where Congress makes no slightest indication that it wants to bar tolling and indeed itself indicates that we want to do the fair thing and allows tolling in two instances as they're set forth on page 24 of our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1479.485" offset="6021308">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.564" offset="6041579">We asked for affirmance here on two independent grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.626" offset="6061850">First, we invoked the settled rule that the Government may not be a estopped by the conduct of its officials to plead limitations as a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.874" offset="6106885">This is because in a suit against the sovereign, the statute of limitations is jurisdictional and a warrant of jurisdiction may not be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.358" offset="6144815">Now, there's no constitutional issue in this case, there is no taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.846" offset="6162787">There was a seizure of some of the assets of the debtor, the Yokohama Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.018" offset="6195493">The Yokohama Bank or its successor bank remained in existence, remained amenable to sue and as Mr. Rauh pointed out, many of these claimants had in fact sought recovery against the bank rather than against the vested property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.576" offset="6265710">And now, I will leave further discussion of that broader principle on which we rely to our brief and turn to the narrower ground and that is that even where there's a suit between private parties to which the doctrine of estoppel could properly be applied, there's no factual basis for its invocation here for there was no arbitrariness and no injustice or unfairness in the manner in which the Government process these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.250" offset="6412413">And before I review the various events which lead up to this suit, I would mention one issue, one fact which seems to us extraneous to the legal issues here although it is -- has been stressed heavily in petitioner's briefs and that is the nationality of these claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.753" offset="6498408">This suit does not arise from any measure taken by the Government against Japanese-Americans in World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.963" offset="6539264">Section 34, the trading with the Enemy Act which is the statute in suit here is not a law which relates to any particular national group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.664" offset="6582000">It is simply a provision for American creditors, whatever their national background -- of enemy concerns whose property was vested.</text>

            <text syncTime="1770.351" offset="7184802">Well one point is this, in order to bring this class action on behalf of these 4100 claimants, all one needed was a single representative of the class, a single individual and a number of individuals, how many I don't know but at least the named plaintiffs here did have counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.044" offset="7291591">Now as I will go on to show that even with respect to individuals who didn't have counsel, we believe that the notice that was given by the Government here was all that the statute or that fairness they require, and I'll try to explain that at greater length.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.374" offset="7380825">Now, I begin with the letter which Mr. Rauh mentioned, which the Alien Property Office sent to all claimants including the petitioners here and where they had counsel -- of record their counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.293" offset="7440593">In 1959, notify me -- that was the amount that the office was prepared to allow and outlining the procedures of four payment and the judicial remedies that they would have and this letter is printed at pages 6 and at 29 of the record, and the letter made four points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.909" offset="7539022">First of all, it reported the ruling of the office that the claims could not be allowed in full because of the post war decline in the value of the Yen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.240" offset="7592312">I stressed the letter -- stated what the Department of Justice had decided on this legal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.705" offset="7626167">It did not say that -- it did not represent that in fact a payment could only be made at that rate because it went on to explain that there were judicial remedies for -- of individuals who were not satisfied with the Department's ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.416" offset="7721044">Now, in this -- the rule in question has been described by petitioners as an arbitrary one in which the Government later repudiated and I -- it maybe helpful to explain briefly what this issue was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.526" offset="7789484">These claimants had deposited dollars in the American branches of the Yokohama Bank and had received in exchange certificates, interest bearing, certificates of deposits, six months certificates deposit which recited and recited only that the bank was making a deposit of Yen in its home office in Japan and that the certificate could be repay -- would be repaid in Japan in Yen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.958" offset="7931173">Now of course, when these depositors asked for their money back from the Alien Property Office, they were asking for dollars and it was necessary to translate this yen obligation into dollars.</text>

            <text syncTime="1984.874" offset="8042872">Now -- and it was because the certificate was unequivocal on its face that the Government relied upon the rule of the Deutsche Bank case, opinion by Mr. Justice Holmes which holds that obligations -- which held incidentally in the context of an Alien Property Bank Deposit case arising from World War I, that an obligation payable in foreign currency in a foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.680" offset="8166066">In that case, the creditor takes the risk of currency fluctuation right to the day of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.683" offset="8194069">Now, it's true that there was a practice of these Japanese banks on the West Coast of repurchasing certificates in dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.763" offset="8242448">Now, it's a question, a difficult question, whether what the banks were doing was simply accommodating customers or whether in fact the banks practice a very -- the obligation on this certificate and made it an obligation to repay in dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.266" offset="8328443">This is a closed question -- it has never been authoritatively resolved that I stressed that it's a genuine question, and when the Alien Property Office resolved it in favor of the post war rate, it was not acting arbitrarily, it had a reasonable legal basis for its action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.922" offset="8419035">Now, this matter in 1959 went on to inform each claimant that if he desired payment of his claim in the amount allowed, he should submit his original certificates of deposit to the Alien Property Office or if he'd lost or mislead them, an affidavit stating that he had not received payment elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.784" offset="8522480">This also was not an arbitrary requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.864" offset="8534810">It was not a mere barrier placed in the path of people trying to collect their money because, the area -- the office knew that many of these claimants had sought a recovery directly from the bank in Japan and the office felt that it ought not pay claims that had already been satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.888" offset="8634911">Now thirdly, the letter informed each claimant that actual payment of the claim would have to await the compilation of a final schedule which listed all claims and hereto, for -- this is incidentally expressly required by the statute and this toois not an arbitrary requirement far --</text>
