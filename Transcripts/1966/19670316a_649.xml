            <text syncTime="15.640" offset="165909">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.316" offset="180642">On the occasion of adjournment yesterday, there was a discussion going on concerning the parallel I was drawing between a statute which prohibits lunatics, and idiots, drunkards, from testifying in the statute in this instance which prohibits a codefendant from testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.186" offset="272071">In order to give you the example of why I think parallel was well drawn Your Honor, I would like to review briefly some of the facts in this case although I dont think they're entirely necessary to a determination question.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.832" offset="322748">Nevertheless counsel yesterday in his argument indicated that if the codefendant had been allowed to testify that he would exonerate the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.358" offset="352841">The petitioner, a young man who went around and gathered up a gang, he was searching for a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.709" offset="410206">He placed it in the hands of his drunken codefendant, placed the rest of his gang around the house to throw rocks at the house to bring someone to the front door.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.258" offset="452420">And apparently at that time he lost his courage.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.484" offset="469347">And according to his testimony and according to the affidavit of the codefendant, the last minute, he turned and ran.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.830" offset="502680">I'd like to point out to the Court that he'd be perfectly guilty as a principle even though he did lose his courage and ran at the last minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.487" offset="533295">He started the whole thing going.</text>
