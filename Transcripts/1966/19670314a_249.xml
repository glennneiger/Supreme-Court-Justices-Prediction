            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">Your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="2.602" stopTime="304.321">
            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="2.602" offset="114792">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.923" offset="124092">In the ten minutes remaining to me, I would like to respond to some of the questions asked yesterday by Mr. Justice Fortas and Mr. Justice Harlan principally where they go to the very core of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.901" offset="171948">And they relate to the Mine Workers issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.434" offset="182084">To its significance to this case and to the position, we are asking the Court to take with regard to the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.594" offset="210819">Mr. Justice Harlan asked whether it was not the threshold issue and it is in the sense that the Court faces the problem of whether it can reach the validity of the injunction on review of the judgment of content.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.724" offset="271318">But it is not the issue in the sense that the Court must reach the constitutional question of whether a state can invoke the Mine Workers issue as a bar to entertaining First Amendment defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.509" offset="322414">The Court can reach the Mine Workers issue but it doesn't have to as it did not for example in Thomas versus Collins in which under state law, the state courts could have and did pass upon the validity of the injunction in the action for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.043" offset="380615">And that, Mr. Justice Fortas, is the difference between our position and the Government's.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.936" offset="396184">The Government argues Mine Workers exclusively and we come here sensitive to a concern that the Court may think it inappropriate to decide a constitutional question of such great importance if that question is not inescapable.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.889" offset="455952">And therefore, the major thrust of our argument is to demonstrate that that maybe done while the Court can reverse without reaching Mine Workers we submit however it cannot affirm without reaching it.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.629" offset="510913">And I should like to mention several grounds on which the Court may reverse without reaching the Mine Workers issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.762" offset="535468">Now the Alabama State Supreme Court gave what purported to be an adequate state ground for affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.144" offset="569010">But we submit that heretofore; state law did not embody Mine Workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.767" offset="591475">The Alabama State Courts gave its reason for refusal to review the judgment of contempt as two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.530" offset="622508">One, the court below was a court of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.108" offset="632853">And two, they would service upon the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.499" offset="642361">However in no case heretofore has Alabama law embodied this as the sole grounds in reviewing a judgment of contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.290" offset="677575">For example, in Fields against City of Fairfield, as I tried to point out yesterday, there was at issue almost precisely the issues that are here in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.318" offset="713624">There was the question of the validity of a permit ordinance which was alleged to give discretion far too broad and vague to administrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.217" offset="757300">There was the validity of the injunction embodying that ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.885" offset="771929">The petitioners in that case went to the State Supreme Court, and the State Supreme Court examined the injunction on a number of grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.681" offset="807142">Disjunctively, it looked that jurisdiction and whether the order was void.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.840" offset="827726">In determining whether the order was void, the State Supreme Court examined the permit ordinance and examined the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.484" offset="854371">And then it said that they -- the permit ordinance and the injunction are valid and it proceeded to affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.856" offset="879867">This Court then reversed it on other grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.741" offset="887390">In our case, they did not examine whether the order was void in the same sense that they did examine whether it was void in the Fields case.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.627" offset="914871">And we submit that Alabama law having heretofore quite clearly embodied that type of review, we were entitled to that kind of view in the State Supreme Court and consequently, there was not an adequate state ground for refusal to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.379" offset="969937">Now the Fields case is not a mutation or a sport in Alabama Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.263" offset="989477">Alabama courts have consistently gone beyond the two narrow grounds that they've given in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.971" offset="1012255">In a case involving indeed another party to this case, Commissioner Connor, In re Connor which is cited in our brief of the Alabama courts looked at whether or not the injunctive order was too vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.651" offset="1067008">And they stated that that would be an adequate ground for reviewing the validity of the injunction in a contempt action.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.244" offset="1097415">And in a very early Alabama case also set forth and discussed at some length in our brief the Alabama -- Merrill -- Board of Review versus Merrill, the Alabama courts looked at whether or not the court of equity had jurisdiction in the sense that they were proper substantive allegations in the complaint of fraud, corruption, and bad faith dealing with the Board of Review -- Board of Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.315" offset="1193650">And it said there was no jurisdiction in a review of the contempt action.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.344" offset="1209741">There was no jurisdiction issue, the injunction and consequently have reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.628" offset="1222907">Now this, we submit, is something that the Alabama courts could have done here under settled Alabama law.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.936" offset="1252164">And therefore this ground is available to this Court because as this Court has done in Thomas versus Collins, and Da -- Donovan versus Dallas, and other cases in which it has reviewed the validity of the injunction and the contempt action if that ground was available in state law that should have been available to us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.703" offset="1319246">Now --</text>

            <text syncTime="322.726" offset="1395315">Well but the question of whether or not, the federal question is properly here, I think it's a question properly for this Court as in -- let us say in NAACP versus Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.862" offset="1427811">One might have said that the state could have changed its law as of that point but these Courts had petitioners who were entitled to rely upon the preexisting law in raising the federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.099" offset="1464801">And indeed we did in the trial court and the trial court did pass upon the validity of the injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="344.234" offset="1481310">Because they were entitled to raise it in the -- in this Court to raise the federal question but here the State Supreme Court has already said that this is the rule of Alabama.</text>

          <turn speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="354.380" stopTime="404.085">
            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="354.380" offset="1521957">Well, but we would submit -- I believe Mr. Justice White that in numerous cases in this Court that when a procedural rule is changed for the first time as a bar to raising a federal question this Court does not consider it a bar to review of that question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.857" offset="1583815">There was the -- the petitioners had good reasons to believe that they could've raised that question and presented that issue in the Alabama courts and indeed the trial court to some extent gave it -- its holding was perhaps an alternative ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.349" offset="1633761">They did pass upon the validity of injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.135" offset="1640970">They cited Cox against New Hampshire saying, this ordinance is okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.415" offset="1654032">See Cox against New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.049" offset="1660615">And the Alabama State Supreme Court did nothing and say we've got a court of equity and we serve the parties and that's the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.034" offset="1680572">Now we submit that we are not therefore barred from bringing this question here via that route.</text>

            <text syncTime="408.393" offset="1737937">You have to say that the petitioners here cannot be held accountable for the violation of an injunction on the basis of Mine Workers if their action viewed in light of the law prior to the law in this case was justified -- arguably justified because of Alabama law.</text>

            <text syncTime="446.747" offset="1891432">But clearly, we would submit that it does not take very much argument in this Court to establish that we did have here an unconstitutional ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.670" offset="1923093">And it was embodied in an injunction which was perhaps more unconstitutional than the ordinance if that were possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="485.639" offset="2046913">And that brings us to another ground while we submit the Court need not reach the Mine Workers question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.941" offset="2072200">Though if the Court were to reach the Mine Workers question, we would submit that the Court ought to there -- go directly to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.148" offset="2096964">But we're aware of many decisions of this Court in which this is something that the Court does -- not likely and we're trying to in argument offer to the Court certain considerations why it doesn't have to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.570" offset="2150672">If it did, we would say the Court ought to reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.183" offset="2161121">And we were precluded from making a record which would demonstrate just what remitting us to Bull Connor would mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.708" offset="2195184">And we would say that before the Court should make a decision on a question like that of rather far reaching constitutional importance to what extent can a first -- can First Amendment rights be frustrated by the issuance of an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.013" offset="2252445">We would say that the Court ought to understand the full implications of doing something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.879" offset="2275955">Constitutional decisions frequently avoid a non -- if the record is not complete, their case -- it say then, if the case comes up in a demurrer and so forth and we here would have wanted too and try to make a complete record showing just what an injunction meant which embodies an ordinance which says, “Go work it out with Bull Connor", and we will prevent it from doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.191" offset="2357144">And we would submit that as an additional ground why the Court -- on which the Court may decide this case without reaching Mine Workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.996" offset="2384415">The Court would have a full record before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.678" offset="2391103">But if it does reach Mine Workers, we would submit that it ought to go to the merits and reverse.</text>

            <text syncTime="672.844" offset="2795792">Now without meaning in the least to quarrel with but a question, the Mine Workers doctrine properly applied in circumstances which clearly called for its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.585" offset="2854724">We do think it's important to point out at the outset what a remarkable extraordinary rule it is in some respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.413" offset="2898087">It does allow the imposition of criminal penalties for the violation of a Court order which by definition is contrary to law or contrary to constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.440" offset="2962139">Now that's a principle rather unique in our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.531" offset="2978544">It does not apply to the commands of the legislature or of the commands of the executive officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.757" offset="3003413">A policeman tells someone to remain or to move on and that order is improper or unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.303" offset="3033610">This Court has repeatedly held that there can be no penalty for violating it.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.211" offset="3053255">Likewise, there can be no penalty through violating a void statutory law nor can there be any penalty for violating the order of a legislative committee when it directs a witness to answer and he has a constitutional privilege to refuse to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.330" offset="3121695">Now in saying all that, we're not as they say trying to disparage the rule, we're trying to find the reason which is special to court decrees which justifies to somewhat harsh absolute principle that the Mine Workers doctrine embodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.131" offset="3216886">Now why should there be such a special rule applicable only to court orders?</text>
            <text syncTime="782.946" offset="3236216">It seems to us that there can only be two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.350" offset="3249800">The first is that judicial orders oriented in a particular case directed against the particular defendant they can find as to time and place and in this respect, they're different from general laws or general executive regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.010" offset="3324406">For the same reason, they're less likely to be vulnerable to such defenses as inapplicability are overbreadth.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.566" offset="3366619">Demanding obedience to court orders is less likely to cause widespread injury than blind obedience to more generalized laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.180" offset="3413117">But even that rational doesn't carry us all the way because there is the same specificity in a policeman's specific directive to a suspect to stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.577" offset="3454704">And there is the same specificity in the order of a legislative committee to witness to answer a particular question.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.577" offset="3482708">So there must be another reason why court orders are especially immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.623" offset="3502874">It seems to us that that reason is that in our system, courts are the final authority with respect to litigable issues to concrete controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.343" offset="3557731">The considered judgments of Courts must be respected since they are the final authority unless we're to altogether abandon the rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.373" offset="3601930">And because of the way the judicial process works, because Courts need time to decide cases, there are temporary stay orders to preserve the case, to preserve the status quo must also be respected.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.158" offset="3677059">Now, applying those rationales to this case, it seems to us that in important respects, they don't fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.491" offset="3730348">This is not a case like the Shipp case for instance in which this Court had issued a stay order pending an appeal here in a capital conviction from a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.215" offset="3785206">This Court, in order to give itself time to decide whether it had jurisdiction of the appeal, stay the execution of the defendant who had been convicted and not withstanding that order, the prisoner was lynched allegedly as it was ultimately found with the connivance of his custodian, the local sheriff.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.657" offset="3883008">That action wholly mooted the case and prevented the judicial process from working.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.474" offset="3910280">Here it seems to us we have rather the reverse of that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.950" offset="3928148">The issuance of the injunction, if it must be obeyed, mooted the legal controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.398" offset="3974019">Because for all practical purposes, this parade, this march or these marches, could not be postponed indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.824" offset="4023651">Their timing was important in the context of Birmingham in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.328" offset="4049669">It could not -- this protest could not serve its purpose several months or several years later when this injunction was ultimately vacated on appeal perhaps even in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2897.434" offset="11694143">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.621" offset="11714832">The first suggestion I would like to make is that the doctrine of Alabama that is the principles decided by the Supreme Court of Alabama relating to the Mine Workers doctrine relates back to the very date that this Court decided that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.470" offset="11786303">In that particular -- at that particular time there was then pending in the Alabama courts the case of Hecker, Greenwood versus Hecker, Hecker versus Greenwood, and there was also pending in that at that time the Hotel Restaurant Employees Association versus Greenwood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.175" offset="11861117">In that case, the Hecker had -- and others had been convicted of several contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.361" offset="11897793">The Supreme Court of Alabama held that since the picketing and the actual strike was no manners for a lawful purpose and was legally conducted, that it did involve First Amendment freedoms of assembly and speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.818" offset="11979713">And that therefore, the Court, the lower court was erroneous in reading the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.568" offset="12006672">They dissolved the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.154" offset="12017016">They then, using the United Mine Workers case as the background, determined that the several contempt convictions were required to fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.354" offset="12073859">But however, the closing paragraph of the opinion was that in view of the United Mine Workers case, the right of the Greenwoods or the state to proceed in criminal contempt was not in anyway impaired by that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.308" offset="12141672">We have read since the -- a matter of the City of Fairfield case has been brought up, we have read that case again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.755" offset="12171452">And we do not find that that case in anyway militates against the doctrine that we have said in our briefs as applied by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.898" offset="12215965">As a matter of fact, we are more convinced and we would invite the Court to read the case, nor that we might be certain that our construction is not biased but as we read that case, the Court in that case said that they were not going to consider the question of the unconstitutionality of the ordinance in the Fields case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.696" offset="12311155">And that by the way was a pure speech question involving the holding of a meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.912" offset="12332053">The requirement of the ordinance was that the -- before a meeting could be held in the City of Fairfield, permit from the mayor must be procured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.149" offset="12373013">Fields was holding a meeting, was planned to hold a meeting, he did not procure a permit.A temporary injunction was issued on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.178" offset="12409062">The Court said that they would not go into the question of the ordinance or the validity of the ordinance either on space or otherwise because they couldn't reach it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.095" offset="12452739">And they took the NAACP case and referred to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.583" offset="12474681">They cited the Mine Workers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.579" offset="12486698">They cite Howat versus Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.817" offset="12495684">And they concluded that as a general rule they said unconstitutional statute is that -- is an absolute nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.704" offset="12531210">It may not be the basis of an illegal right or legal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.075" offset="12544690">But however though, when an injunction has been issued and without taking the normal means of attacking that injunction by a motion to dissolve a discharge, the defendant may not in criminal contempt in -- in a con -- appeal or certiorari from criminal contempt raise the question of its unconstitutionality and collateral proceedings on appeal, from a judgment of conviction in the contempt case or on that case read as habeas corpus or for certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="3309.082" offset="13340693">Now as I read In re Green, the fault or the vice of that case was that this lawyer was convicted of criminal contempt that is constructive contempt, without being afford a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.423" offset="13402133">He tried to defend his case but was deprived of that privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.926" offset="13424076">As I understand the opinion which was written reasonably by Mr. Justice Douglas, comment was made about the Mine Workers case but the question though, the primitive question was that there was no hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.806" offset="13479664">And I believe that Mr. Justice Douglas said that, that that illustrated the device of the whole thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.846" offset="13507772">That is the preemption doctrine because you couldn't tell whether it's in the preemption doctrine involved or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.192" offset="13529192">In as much as they never did reached that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.320" offset="13541627">They never did give a chance for the Court to determine that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.415" offset="13558032">Now, Mr. Justice Harlan I believe in the -- in a concurring opinion in that case, did say that he did not feel that that case will take against the Mine Workers doctrine and there I believed conclude that the Mine Workers doctrine holds that even if the federal courts were barred by the acts of Congress from issuing the injunction in that case, that nevertheless, it is the duty of the defendants to abide and perform the injunction at least while it was in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.890" offset="13695958">And until it was dissolved or discharged or some other method used to dislodge it and it should be obeyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.090" offset="13720722">And that failure to do so would constitute criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.683" offset="13739112">That we say is -- we feel is the holding of that case clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.252" offset="13773385">Now, there has been much said about the vagueness of the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.014" offset="13800448">Actually, the injunction does say very specifically that the action above designated I've read to in the appellate complaint or the Acts that are related to and are enjoined and specifically referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.312" offset="13893653">Among those Acts related to in connection with mass picketing and mass street parades, mass processions or like demonstrations without a permit we have again foresee of the bill of complaint a situation very similar to those that which developed on April 8, 12, and April the 14th, that is to say the Good Friday and the Easter parades.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.233" offset="13985290">We say that those particular demonstrations, the forerunner of those particular demonstrations were set forth in the bill of complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="6559.519" offset="26342463">Mr. Justice Fortas asked about Fields versus City of Fairfield and I would like to say the language he quoted is on page 52 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6567.893" offset="26376004">But in addition to that language, the Supreme Court of Alabama did pass upon the merits of the injunction and did pass upon the merits of the ordinance and treated with the Mine Workers question as going to jurisdiction in the disjunctive.</text>
            <text syncTime="6582.272" offset="26433473">And therefore we claim that the merits of the injunction and the ordinance were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6587.099" offset="26452804">Justice Black asked, whether or not, Mr. Claiborne and I assume the same question applied to us would agree that the municipality can regulate the streets and perhaps under some circumstances prohibit use of the streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="6600.305" offset="26505571">And certainly we would concede that that is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6602.390" offset="26513930">No one denies that but, we think the law is clear that it must be done under precise standards, and it must be done on the basis of equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="6609.800" offset="26543606">The quality is to all and I think that is our position in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6612.672" offset="26555099">There has been some mention, Mr. Justice Black of the facts of the demonstrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6617.502" offset="26574430">That however was never an issue below.</text>
            <text syncTime="6619.675" offset="26583103">The only thing was in issue was, was there a permit?</text>
            <text syncTime="6622.042" offset="26592611">And in fact, the police testified that the marchers and the onlookers were separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6629.203" offset="26621241">The police had cleared out the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6630.953" offset="26628242">There was no vehicular traffic in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6633.110" offset="26636810">There were no White people in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6634.953" offset="26644229">Any disorder that occurred with the three or four arrest were not in the marchers, there were other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="6639.893" offset="26663978">The police testified that they could have obtained assistance if they needed it from a sheriff's office or the state police but they did not need it and did not seek to get it.</text>
