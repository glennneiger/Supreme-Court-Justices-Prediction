            <label>Mr. David W. Belin</label>
            <text syncTime="19.570" offset="181687">Honorable Chief Justice and Associate Justices, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.006" offset="203421">The basic issue in this case is what constitutes effective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.817" offset="234663">The case is on appeal from the Supreme Court of Iowa, and involves the issues of due process and equal protection of the laws and effective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.181" offset="276146">The petitioner Harvey Entsminger was arrested without warrant on June the 12th, 1964 on a traffic violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.933" offset="315120">At the time of his arrest the Des Moines Police Apartment were looking for Mr. Entsminger on an alleged bad check charge and he was taken to the police station and arrested and asked to leave his personal effects with the jailer for safekeeping as was customary at the Des Moines police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.347" offset="392756">Included in these personal effects which were placed in a locker in a safe were two handwritten personal letters written by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.353" offset="436746">Two-and-a-half weeks after his arrest, Lieutenant Dawson of the Identification Bureau of the Des Moines police department asked the petitioner to submit a sample of his handwriting and the petitioner refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.038" offset="491499">Lieutenant Dawson had been present at the arrest two-and-a-half weeks earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.593" offset="509785">He remembered that there were two letters that have been placed in the safe and although of these were not instrumentalities of any crime or evidence of any crime, he removed these letters from the safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.806" offset="558582">Now there's a dispute in the record as to whether or not this was voluntary or not voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.481" offset="581256">In any event, several months later, in October with court-appointed counsel, the indigent Harvey Enstminger was tried for the bad check charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.387" offset="624933">These letters were used as an important part of the chain of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.264" offset="640397">Mr. Entsminger was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.088" offset="651682">He was sentenced to a term not to exceed 10 years and he is now incarcerated in the Fort Madison Penitentiary in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.156" offset="679999">Mr. Enstminger asked the court to appoint a new lawyer to represent him to file a motion for a new trial and to file an appeal to the Iowa Supreme Court and in the State of Iowa appeal as a matter of right, a new counsel was appointed, a man by the name of Henry Warnley.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.471" offset="745305">He filed a motion for a new trial, and the motion was overruled and the sentence imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.306" offset="772577">Then Mr. Warnley had 60 days to file on behalf of the petitioner a notice of appeal, and within this 60-day period, a notice was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.925" offset="807058">And that gave Mr. Warnley 90 days to file what we call a printed record on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.299" offset="836524">Unfortunately, at the end of February, the 90-day period expired, there was no record on appeal filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="296.973" offset="1291264">That the Attorney -- the Attorney General as a matter of fact in this particular case, the appointed counsel Mr. Warnley finally did serve, after the expiration of this 90-day period, Mr. Warnley did served a notice on the Attorney General specifying his intent to file a record and a brief and although the Iowa Supreme Court had ordered that the case be submitted on a clerk's transcript which is not a transcript of the record at all, that the Iowa Supreme Court set aside that order without prejudice to the Attorney General's office to file a motion to dismiss and I think it's indicative of the Attorney General's office that they did not elect to stand on the technicality of a motion to dismiss, but rather wanted to have the appeal heard in substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.636" offset="1477883">And in this particular case, they are not arguing about sending it down to the Iowa Supreme Court although I think there might be some disagreement between us as to whether or not on the one hand, we argue, at least I argue, that the clerk's transcript system itself is either per se unconstitutional because it permits this very thing happening that happened here, and by the way, I personally have taken a survey of the clerk's transcript cases over the past 15 years in Iowa and out of several hundred cases, there has never been a reversal, at least to the best of my knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.510" offset="1613406">And so, I argue that either the clerk's transcript system itself is per se unconstitutional or in the alternative it cannot be used under Douglas, and as reaffirmed this recently as your decision on Mundy, the Missouri case that it cannot be used without some protection of the right for indigent defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="879.789" offset="3622536">I'm going to be very brief this morning because as Mr. Justice Fortas has already pointed out, we more or less conceded the case insofar as a remand being necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="922.129" offset="3791914">And he had brought me in to handle criminal -- criminal appeals and I recall that the first conference we had was about editorials that were being written regarding the clerk's transcript system.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.192" offset="3848129">The writer of these editorials is a resident of Des Moines and writes for the Des Moines registrant tribunal and he had been suggesting that the clerk's transcript appeal system was used by some attorneys to -- some attorneys to give the appearance of their appointed or the client for which they were appointed actually getting appeal and the client not getting such an appeal and there was some evidence to this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.442" offset="3961187">But anyway, the Attorney General asked me if I would do some research into it and try to come up with some conclusions and some recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.433" offset="4001102">As things worked out, I never had the time to do that research because of the pressing number of appeals and never got into the problem until this Court granted certiorari in the Enstminger case and it's obvious that in the instant case, the petitioner did desire an appeal as was expressed in the record and as you will find in our brief, and I don't think we can say we will relinquish the desire to have plenary review the merits of the proceedings culminating any his conviction and he didn't receive it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.657" offset="4137984">I concede to you in all candor that clerk's transcript does not present an adequate record upon which an individual can obtain meaningful review.</text>
