            <text syncTime="35.514" offset="245426">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.931" offset="263084">The complaint here alleged two causes of action, one based upon Title 42, Section 1983 of the 18 -- based upon the 1871 Civil Rights Act and the second cause of action was a common law action for false imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.947" offset="335182">The defendants in each -- of each of these causes of action were the police officers and the convicting magistrate who had incarcerated the petitioners herein, the petitioners being one of Negro and three white Episcopal ministers who were arrested in the bus station in Jackson, Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.879" offset="442911">At the trial, before on the damage question which is present before this Court before Judge Mize of the Southern District of Mississippi, before him in a jury, there was a verdict for the defendant that is the respondents here.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.779" offset="514487">The petitioners appeal to the Fifth Circuit and the Fifth Circuit reversed because of errors made by Judge Mize with regard to the admission of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.209" offset="560253">However, in reversing the Fifth Circuit dismissed the case against the magistrate respondents Pierson here and in so far of damages was concerned set forth a rule on the new trial which indicated that if there was a finding, that there was a plan and purpose to be arrested then the petitioners here could not recover in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.470" offset="685223">It was on those two issues purely.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.722" offset="694209">On those two issues mainly that we came to this Court and upon our petition certiorari was granted by this Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carl Rachlin</label>
            <text syncTime="162.829" offset="754709">They are raised in the cross-petition Your Honor by my colleague but they are not raised by us.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.868" offset="790862">Now, very briefly and I will try to be very brief because there are the forth questions of law and noble to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.820" offset="822627">Very briefly, the facts are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.822" offset="834644">The general convention of the Episcopal Church, the trial in general convention of Episcopal Church was to be held in September 1961 in Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.266" offset="876440">The petitioners here particularly petitioner Reverend John Morris who was the Director of the Episcopal Society for Cultural and Racial Unity, thought it would be great witness for that church to hold a prayer pilgrimage beginning in New Orleans and ending in Detroit and on the way bearing Christian witness to factors in various communities going up generally to Mississippi Valley on the way to Detroit with intention of stopping to places like Suwanee, Dearborn, Michigan as well as Jackson, Mississippi and they set out by bus from New Orleans and arrived in Jackson and spent the night on the day before the arrest were made here at Tougaloo College.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.338" offset="1092733">There had been of course some publicity in the papers and the news, in the radio about their activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.721" offset="1118229">But the next morning when they went with tickets for the -- for Continental Railway bus to Chattanooga and they had not given any publicity, there's nothing in the record which indicates that anyone knew when they were arriving at the bus station.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.812" offset="1182595">And the fact of the matter is that the record reflects that when they did arrive at the bus station no one was waiting for them, the police testimony was very clear on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.393" offset="1224913">They arrived quietly in taxi cabs.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.812" offset="1234631">There were two police waiting on the back ramp of the bus station.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.219" offset="1248214">The police went around the back way and met the priest as they walked through the main entrance of the bus station passed a police expansion right in front of the entrance to the bus station which said "White only by order of the police."</text>
            <text syncTime="302.651" offset="1313938">As they went into the door of the bus station, Father Jones, one of the petitioners here heard one of the officer say, "Shall we get them now or shall we wait until later.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.949" offset="1371199">In any event, the -- there were 15 priests on this group, four of whom are petitioners here walked through the entrance and started towards the coffee shop a few feet inside the bus station.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.417" offset="1429086">A few of them of the 15 did actually get into the coffee shop but at that point, one of the two officers, either officer Nichols and Griffith, two of the respondents here halted them and made them come -- those who are in the bus station come back and they halt at the whole group and were told to move on.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.965" offset="1511215">At this point, one of the priests said, "We're on our way to Chattanooga.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.839" offset="1530755">We have tickets and we wanted to have -- it will be a long trip, we wanted to have coffee or sandwich or something before we take off on our trip."</text>
            <text syncTime="365.355" offset="1564818">No coffee, the police officer said, "Move on."</text>
            <text syncTime="367.529" offset="1573491">With no moving on they were arrested and not being told, the record doesn't reflect why they were they were being arrested at that point or what they were being arrested for or why they were told to move on.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.611" offset="1617795">But in any event, a few moments later the respondent Ray, the deputy chief of police of Jackson, Mississippi at that time the captain of the police came in the station and immediately went up to these people and told him to move on not seeking information from the other police officer who are already under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.877" offset="1698879">In any event, they went on and he told to move on.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.131" offset="1711940">They repeated the same thing, they wanted to have a sandwich before they took off to Chattanooga and he at that point not moving on, he also arrested them and they were then taken off in the traditional Jackson paddy wagon to the jail and whether they stay two days later where the case was then tried before the Magistrate Spencer who convicted them and sentenced them him to the maximum sentence of four months in jail for the offense that they committed as well as a fine which was put upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.696" offset="1862196">All the petitioners here remained in jail for at least seven and Father Jones I think something like 17 or 18 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.532" offset="1897514">The reason being that Bell was coming from various communities to help them out and took at least seven days to get there and more for Father Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.994" offset="1939310">In any event, after they all were released, they went on to the convention, they appealed the case and in Mississippi, the first appellate procedure is this de novo trial and after de novo trial of Father Jones, the first one tried, after the prosecution's case was in, motion was made to dismiss and the judge presiding at that level dismissed the case on the grounds there was no showing of a violation of the statute was there and all the other cases were accordingly now crossed.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.006" offset="2067414">At that point, shortly thereafter, the complaints served and the case before us and was tried as I said for Judge Mize, defendant's verdict we appealed to the Fifth Circuit as indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.725" offset="2122271">Now, the first issue that I would like to spend some time is the one -- in which the Fifth Circuit dismissed the action against the convicting magistrate Spencer, one of the respondents herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.178" offset="2188100">Now, it is our position that this was an error for many reasons and I would like to go into that somewhat.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.275" offset="2220492">The statute of course 1983 the opening words are every person so that on its face anyone who violates 1983 who violates 1983, whoever, whatever his position in life may be is liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.802" offset="2278588">But question then is, are there any limitations in this broad language which should be a guide to any court considering the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.408" offset="2321011">Prior to the well known case decided by this Court in 1951 of Tenney against Brandhove, there had only been one case interpreting this point to the best of our knowledge and that was the case entitled Picking against the Pennsylvania Railroad, a Third Circuit case which held in the manner that we are requesting this Court to hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.083" offset="2399692">That is there was not an immunity for a judge who violated the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.040" offset="2427486">However, Tenney against Brandhove set off a whole line of cases which I referred to in both of the opinion of the court below and are referred to in my worthy opponent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.624" offset="2481821">And in fact, I think this Court has either accepted or is considering certiorari in two related cases involving Dombrowski case and a Bauers against Heisel case on related questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.745" offset="2546395">Every circuit deciding the case since Tenney has decided in a manner which we consider in error in interpreting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.634" offset="2589863">Now, Tenney involves --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="623.217" offset="2596237">To -- has to judicial immunity?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carl_rachlin" startTime="625.433" stopTime="626.941">
            <label>Mr. Carl Rachlin</label>
            <text syncTime="625.433" offset="2605119">There's a judicial, yes, Your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="626.941" stopTime="629.913">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="626.941" offset="2611179">You are referring now only to this judicial defendant.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carl_rachlin" startTime="629.913" stopTime="970.033">
            <label>Mr. Carl Rachlin</label>
            <text syncTime="629.913" offset="2622986">I am not concerned with any other questions, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.368" offset="2632808">Now, Tenney involves of course a state legislature -- legislator of the State of California who was sued under 1983 by someone claiming that he Tenney have violated his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.541" offset="2681501">Now, under Tenney, the majority decision was based upon was considered to be the ancient immunity of the legislators and there is no other basis for that decision as set forth in the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.481" offset="2753285">Oddly enough, this, of course, reason is irrelevant because if the 1871 Congress wanted to specifically include state legislators the fact that there may have been an ancient history exempting legislators would be of no consequence whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.773" offset="2822457">However, the majority decision in Tenney is decided solely on the basis of the ancient history of immunity to state legislators.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.398" offset="2861014">Now, there were at least two other ways in which the case could have been decided in the same -- coming to the same conclusion which would have however been more accurately a reflection of the law and I would like to dwell on those for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.388" offset="2932903">The first one of course concerns the legislative history of 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.659" offset="2966026">When Congressman Shielbagga (ph) of Ohio introduced the legislation we are concerned with in the House of Representative in 1871, he made the following comments and I read from the congressional law appendix of March 28, 1871 42nd Congress First Session, he said as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.088" offset="3063724">"My first inquiry is as to the warrant which we have for enacting such as section as this.The model forth will be found in the second section of the Act of 89 -- 1866."</text>
            <text syncTime="753.042" offset="3115551">If I may interpolate, those are the sections of Title 18 241 and 242 which have been considered by this Court in Price for example -- U.S. against Price for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.404" offset="3157034">That section provides a criminal proceeding in identically the same case as this one provides a civil remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.505" offset="3197367">Now, that being so if the majority opinion in Tenney had followed that forth along and would have turn to Senator Trumbull's explanation in the Congressional Globe of April 4, 1866 when he replied to the veto by the then President Johnson of the 1866 Act Title, that is what now titled 18241 and 242.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.372" offset="3328815">President Johnson referred specifically to the point that came up in Tenney against Brandhove and what does he say?</text>
            <text syncTime="813.177" offset="3356087">Who is to be -- and I quote from page 1758 of the Act of the Congressional Globe of April 4, 1866, "Who is to be punished?"</text>
            <text syncTime="826.591" offset="3409690">Is the law to be punished?</text>
            <text syncTime="828.609" offset="3417840">Are the men who make the law to be punished?</text>
            <text syncTime="831.725" offset="3430275">Is that the language of the Bill?"</text>
            <text syncTime="833.619" offset="3437798">Not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.276" offset="3444485">If any person on the color of any law shall subject another to the deprivation of a right to which he is entitled, he is to be punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.005" offset="3483355">The person who is under the color of the law, does the act not the man who made the law" and goes on in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.330" offset="3520658">In other words, what he is saying very specifically is that both from the point of view of the intent of the Congress of that period and from the point of view of the analysis of the words of the statute, state legislators were immune under both Title 18240, what is now Title 182141 and of course under Title 42 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.119" offset="3631835">In other words, state legislators are to be immune but what does he say about judges?</text>
            <text syncTime="887.856" offset="3654823">In other words, he makes the very distinction that we are trying to make in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.820" offset="3682617">And because I might interpolate again, President Johnson when he vetoed this 1866 Act two of the reasons specifically given by him for his veto concerned the immunity of legislators and that the alleged denials of the legislators and the alleged denial of immunity of judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.448" offset="3785122">Now we have seen Senator Trumbull who replied to President Johnson as to what he said about legislators.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.154" offset="3815946">Now this is what he said about judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.823" offset="3826709">When it is said that under this provisions, judges of the Court and ministry of offices who are engaged in the execution of sub-statutes may be punished and that is made in objection to this bill referring to this president's veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.082" offset="3879685">I admit that a ministry of officers or a judge if the acts corruptly or viciously in the execution or under power of any illegal act may be and ought to be punished but if he acted innocently the judge would not be punished, and further on a judge who acted innocently and not viciously or oppressively would never be convicted under this Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.784" offset="7846536">And my position is that that's what opposing counsel has done, they have argued their own testimony or their own complaint of allegations in that complaint without any record whatsoever to prove on the other side on what was a jury issue or issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.080" offset="7939741">This is a suit in tort of money damages in two counts, based on the common law for false arrest and second on the 1983.</text>

            <text syncTime="1997.007" offset="8091355">The issues in this case of whether or not there is any judicial immunity as a matter of law when there was no proof whatsoever of any corruption or any wrong intent and whether or not there is a partial or limited immunity to police officers who act in good faith with reasonable grounds to believe that it was a question of fact, with reasonable grounds to prove, to believe that the statute was being violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.480" offset="8245269">That they were -- that they had probably cause which as I state is a question of fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="2060.960" offset="8347251">And in doing so, I hope the Court will recall and keep in mind that this could in 1961, we would look at the facts of the case in view of the times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.424" offset="8409109">We must look at the facts in the case in the view of the mood of the people, of the tenseness of the people in the City of Jackson.</text>

            <text syncTime="2955.666" offset="11926026">I would not purport to attempt to go into the history of that congressional act in 1871 to the extent that Tenney versus Brandhove did but the basis or the end of that testimony, of their position as to the legislative history was that there was no intent to change common law tort liability.</text>
