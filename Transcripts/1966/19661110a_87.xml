            <text syncTime="22.473" offset="193285">This is an appeal from the United States District Court, the Northern District of Georgia dismissing the complaint and action brought to compel the House of Representatives of the General Assembly of Georgia to admit an elective representative, Julian Bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.891" offset="254934">The plaintiffs were not on in Mr. Bond, but Dr. Martin Luther King, a constituent and resident, Mrs. (Inaudible), a resident and registered voter, each suing as members of their respective classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.112" offset="311777">The plaintiffs sought an injunction against the enforcement of a special House resolution excluding Mr. Bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.582" offset="341661">The plaintiffs also sought injunction against the state constitutional provisions upon which the House relied to exclude him.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.784" offset="370500">The appellees are James 'Sloppy' Floyd, an elder state official who is acting in concert with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.454" offset="417207">A general election was held in Georgia on June 15, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.255" offset="440404">That election was conducted pursuant to legislation enacted in the weight of the decision in Toombs against Fortson as a result, House District 136 was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.536" offset="485543">Mr. Bond was opposed in that election by Malcolm J.Dean, who was a Dean of Men at Atlanta University in Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.089" offset="515741">In that election, Bond polled 2320 votes to 487 votes for Dean.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.228" offset="544266">More persons voted in Bond's District, in District 136 then in any other district within the entire state.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.181" offset="584077">There are 6500 voters in House District 136, 6000 of them are Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.954" offset="619186">About two weeks before, Mr. Bond was scheduled to have been sworn in as a member of the House of Representatives.</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard Moore, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="142.711" offset="674252">A worker sir with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee known variously and popularly as SNCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.544" offset="701524">Young was a navy veteran.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.123" offset="707897">He was shot and killed near a gasoline service station in Tuskegee, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.589" offset="729736">Young had lost one of his kidneys in the ill-fated Bay of Pig -- the Bay of Pigs invasion off the coast of Cuba in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.001" offset="759411">He was approaching the service station to use the restroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.312" offset="772577">Samuel Young was very well liked within SNCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.192" offset="788146">Three days after Young's funeral on January 6, 1966, SNCC issued the statement to the press, critical of American policy in Vietnam and of his pass for respecting equal rights for Negroes in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.022" offset="851466">The entire statement is set forth at pages 135 to 137 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.537" offset="873514">The statement plays responsibility for the murder of Samuel Young upon the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.927" offset="899114">The statement equated, the failure of the administration to protect Samuel Young with the death of Vietnamese peasants resulting from the aggressive foreign policy conductive in the violation of international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.492" offset="949373">The following four paragraphs are perhaps the most relevant paragraphs to these procedures and I shall read from the record at page 137.</text>

            <text syncTime="225.215" offset="1004231">Those paragraphs recite as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.804" offset="1018546">We are in sympathy with and support the men in this country who are unwilling to respond to a military draft, which would compel them to contribute their lives to United States' aggression in Vietnam in the name of the freedom we find so close in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.649" offset="1090017">We recoil with horror at the inconsistency of a supposedly free society where responsibility to freedom is equated with responsibility to men -- oneself to military aggression.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.021" offset="1139440">We take note to the fact that 16% of the draftees from this country are Negroes called on to stay for liberation in Vietnam to preserve a democracy which does not exist with them at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.993" offset="1191372">We ask, where is the draft for the freedom fight of the United States?</text>
            <text syncTime="277.305" offset="1212583">We therefore encourage those Americans who prefer to use their energy in building democratic forums within this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.558" offset="1241631">We believe that work in the civil rights movement and with other human relations organizations is a valid alternative to the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.202" offset="1276217">We urge all Americans to seek this alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.675" offset="1290115">Going full well, it may cost their lives as painfully as in Vietnam.</text>

            <text syncTime="321.108" offset="1387813">A following release of the statement later in the afternoon, a newsman employed by a state-owned radio station, WGST in Atlanta caused union buying at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.932" offset="1435146">And I have to repeat, Mr. Bond was at home at that time he received this particular call.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.589" offset="1457716">The newsman asked by who did not, as we said earlier, participate in drafting the statement whether he endorsed the SNCC statement by replied he did and added, as a pacifist he was opposed to all laws and was eager and anxious to encourage people not to participate in it for any reason that they chose.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.147" offset="1535979">The newsman pressed Bond to specify his reasons for endorsing the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.181" offset="1556146">And Bond said, "I agree of the statement because of the reasons set forth in it, because I think it's sort of hypocritical for us to maintain that we are fighting for liberty in other places and were not guaranteeing liberty to citizens inside the communal of United States".</text>
            <text syncTime="380.454" offset="1625213">He was further pressed by the newsman and he reiterated his pacifist beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.174" offset="1644022">And he indicated that he was opposed to either side killing in Vietnam.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.603" offset="1661785">That is to the United States killing in Vietnam and to the Vietcong killing in Vietnam.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.548" offset="1681533">And that his temperament was such that he was opposed to abrupt changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.612" offset="1697834">This may be found in the record of page 114.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.372" offset="1720822">On the morning of January 10, 1966, Mr. Bond arrived in the House of Representatives to take his oath as a representative elect from the 136 House District.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.767" offset="1766484">Now this was not the first time that Mr. Bond had gone to the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.249" offset="1784351">He'd gone there earlier in -- about two years earlier to observe a proceeding and he was forcefully ejected from the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.146" offset="1819982">The clerk on this occasion in January 10th, 1966, ordered him to stand aside as the oath was administered to other representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.650" offset="1861987">Challenges were filed to Mr. Bond's right to be sworn and seated.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.812" offset="1878601">The challenges were signed by at least 75 white members of the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.715" offset="1898245">They were based upon Mr. Bond's statement to the press, the petitions charged among other things that Bond's actions and statements gave aid and comfort to the enemies of the United States, violated the Selective Service law, tended to bring discredit and disrespect to the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.811" offset="1966582">The challenges are set out in the record at pages 13th and 15th.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.099" offset="1983718">Also said that Mr. Bond's statements indicated that he could not take the oath, they were repugnant to the oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.693" offset="2018095">A special committee then was composed for the rules committee and three additional members, including two Negro members.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.194" offset="2048188">I should say they were approximately eight Negroes who were in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.608" offset="2061772">This was the first time that a Negro had sat in the House since 1907 and this was due to reapportionment and one other White representative from Fulton County.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.823" offset="2106702">A hearing was held on the challenge petitions for the expressed privilege of deciding the substance of what Mr. Bond said and the intentions behind what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.001" offset="2155395">For evidence, they introduced the tape of a phone interview on January 6,1966, a tape of an interview with Mr. Bond in the hall of the state capital immediately after the clerk refused to administer the oath to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.991" offset="2211297">And they call Mr. Bond as a witness apparently against himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.307" offset="2228642">There is note of this tape are on file and available to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.593" offset="2245778">At the hearing, Mr. Bond was asked whether he admired the courage of people who burnt their draft cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.811" offset="2270647">And his reply was, "I admire people who take who take an action and admire people who feel strongly enough about their convictions to take an action knowing the consequences they will face.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.313" offset="2328639">And that was my original statement when asked a question".</text>
            <text syncTime="559.644" offset="2341909">Mr. Bond called four witnesses who urged proceeding and stated that he deserved the right to be seated.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.764" offset="2366464">One of those witnesses was his opponent in the democratic primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.957" offset="2383182">The other was his opponent in the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.871" offset="2394885">The other two witnesses were the two Negro members of the Georgia State Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.374" offset="2412857">The special committee then recommended that Mr. Bond not to be seated.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.067" offset="2427591">A two-Negro member dissented along a white legislator from Fulton County.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.377" offset="2448906">The House then adopted House Resolution 19 not to seat Mr. Bond in accordance with the majority recommendation from the special committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.017" offset="2483388">Mr. Bond and his constituents then brought this action for injunctive relief and declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.091" offset="2511705">On February 14, 1966, the special three-judge court rendered -- filed a judgment against the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.729" offset="2538245">It unanimously held that it had jurisdiction because the plaintiffs had a series -- substantial First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.973" offset="2567293">The Court -- Chief Judge Tuttle dissenting struck from the complaint the names of the appellants other than Mr. Bond on the grounds that they like such a direct interest in the litigation which would give them standing to bring the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.247" offset="2620374">On the merits, the Court was also divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.700" offset="2630196">The majority agreed that the substantial issue in the case rests on the guarantee of freedom of speech or to dissent under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.004" offset="2667395">Nevertheless, it held that Mr. Bond's statements, an affirmation of the SNCC statement as they go on the functioning of the Selective Service system could reasonably be said to be inconsistent with and repugnant to the oath which he would be required to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.069" offset="2739597">Since the exclusion and while this case has been pending on appeal, Mr. Bond has been twice reelected to office.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.700" offset="2774183">The first reelection occurred in February of 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.498" offset="2789334">He was unopposed in that election, he won it by 682 vote to none.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.972" offset="2811277">He was again reelected on November 8, 1966, justice Tuesday, by a vote of 2136 to 948.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.990" offset="2851297">That can be very little doubt that Mr. Bond is the choice of the voters in House District 136.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.328" offset="2884733">But with respect to the legal issues presented or raised by these set of facts, Mr. Boudin will develop them in detail.</text>

            <text syncTime="707.303" offset="2932590">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.294" offset="2948577">The central issue in this case, I see -- as I think Your Honors conceive from the development by Mr. Moore is whether a state legislative body's refusal to sit an elected representative whether refusal is based upon his public expressions of opinion on national issues, whether such a refusal violates the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment incorporated in the Fourteenth, whether it deprives him since it is a national issue that was under discussion of a privilege in immunity under the Fourteenth Amendment and whether it unconstitutionally deprive those who elected Mr. Bond of their right of franchise in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, possibly the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.862" offset="3178872">Now the court below recognized that there was a very substantial issue of freedom of speech involved here, as it indicated at page 142 of the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.137" offset="3231953">But it held that an elected rep -- legislator had less right than an individual citizen to express his views on public issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="861.768" offset="3550438">Now, the difficulty with the Court's reasoning in holding that a legislator elect has less right to express himself on public issues, is that it assumed the voice contrary to what this Court has said in Lemont and in Martin against Travis and a number lot of cases that it is solely for the of the speaker that the First Amendment was written and is to be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.705" offset="3654196">On the contrary, there is at least a greater right in the public to hear the speaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.656" offset="3673945">And so the status of the speaker should not derogate from the right of the public to hear his statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.771" offset="3698500">As a matter of fact this Court explicitly in Wood against Georgia in a quotation which is set forth at page 30 of our brief held that an elected sheriff had a right to issue a press relief challenging a charge to a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.565" offset="3773628">And the Court said that the petitioner was an elected official and had the right to enter the field of political controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.498" offset="3805393">The role that elected official playing our society and he makes it all the more imperative, that they'd be allowed freely to express themselves on matters of current public importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.356" offset="3848756">But our position here is not nearly that there was a right on the part of Mr. Bond to make the statement, that he had a duty to express himself if those were his views on these public issues or at least three interrelated reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.602" offset="3913749">The first is that, as a presumed leader, we now see he's been elected three times, leader of his people in the 136th District.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.191" offset="3960142">He has the right to exercise his influence upon them to attempt to persuade them to his point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.037" offset="3987519">The second is, it can be presumed, I think fairly, that he states it for a substantial number of them, they having elected him several times in the course of this controversy and he as their spokesman and if that is their view, why cannot it be expressed through him.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.202" offset="4060139">And the third reason, is the reason suggested by this Court's statement in Garrison against Louisiana and in New York Times against Sullivan, namely that the public has a right to know anything that affects the qualifications of the individual whom they have elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.557" offset="4137566">And what could be a better way of assessing the qualifications of the man but in having him express his views in this way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1917.703" offset="7774229">Now tending for the moment for the question of the Georgia constitution and the oath of office, the court below recognized that there was no qualification set forth in the Georgia constitution which was not met by Mr. Bond, and that he was disqualified under any of the specific provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.077" offset="7867643">What it said however was that there was a rational basis for -- the belief by the legislative body that Mr. Bond could not conscientiously take the oath to support the constitution of the United States and of Georgia.</text>

            <text syncTime="3450.714" offset="13906213">As has been safely apparent from the discussion of the problem before this Court today is a great historical significance not because the Georgia legislature is the only legislative body which has ever refused to seat a member in judging his qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.829" offset="13986670">But because this is the first time insofar as we have been able to ascertain that the issues presented in this case have ever been before the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.182" offset="14040064">Indeed historically, there seems to be a lack of precedent for this case to be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.657" offset="14074023">But I should concede in candor that in view of recent decisions of this Court, history alone does not control nor indeed should it control and without waiting or conceding any of the arguments raised in our brief, I will consign our argument to the basic constitutional questions raised and the basic constitutional rights of Mr. Bond which this Court may find it necessary to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.078" offset="14215711">When the Julian Bond's story broke the New York Times interviewed Louie Loreman who was one of the five socialist who were expelled by the New York Legislature in 1919.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.709" offset="14270255">It inquired why no court action had been taken by them at that time, said Mr. Loreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.127" offset="14295855">We regard the concept of separation of powers as far more important than own case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3575.766" offset="14406405">So I think it will be readily agreed therefore that this is a first impression case before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.255" offset="14444440">And that is it may for the first time construe the power of a legislative body in determining qualification of its selected membership, it is of paramount importance.</text>
