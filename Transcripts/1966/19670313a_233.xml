            <text syncTime="15.511" offset="165386">May it please the Mr. Chief Justice and the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.224" offset="180224">This maritime action arises in grant a certiorari from the Second Circuit following a trial in the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.265" offset="220453">During the course of which or at the close of which, after all the evidence was in, the trial court determined to dismiss a portion of the seaman's claim and to refuse to permit the jury to pass upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.665" offset="281997">And that specific claim is what is before the Court now, and that is whether the fact as was demonstrated by fact testimony and expert testimony that there were an insufficient number of men provided for a particular test aboard the ship at the particular time and place the job function was to be carried out was within the reach and doctrine scope of the concept of unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.310" offset="404564">The Second Circuit divided two to one on the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.424" offset="417102">Indeed, the trial court had himself change his mind during the course of the case, having first decided it in favor of the seaman and this Court of course has granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.978" offset="463287">Now the issue as presented might be deemed noble in the sense that this Court has not specifically passed upon it in the sense of manpower insufficiency creating unseaworthiness or at least a jury question for resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.781" offset="534444">But this Court has of course on numerous occasions stated quite clearly that any insufficiency of equipment, the pertinences or appliances for a particular task at the time and place the task is performed aboard the ship gives rise to a condition of unseaworthiness, at the very least, creates a question for jury resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.685" offset="634128">And of course, this Court's historic and landmark position in Mitchell v. Trawler Racer enunciated more clearly than ever before that the doctrines and concepts and concerns of negligence law were to be completely eliminated from any determination of unseaworthiness liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.891" offset="726915">Of course, that was again reiterated in the Gutierrez opinion and in the Reed opinion of some three terms ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="447.360" offset="1892812">It is only if the action which gave basis to the civil court federal jurisdiction has been found to be without color and merely presented for the purposes of obtaining the jurisdiction that the pending case lose its all -- loses all its status to be decided as it would be if the other actions didn't fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.008" offset="1967417">That I submit is my understanding of that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.030" offset="1983509">In any case, if I may turn to the specific question of unseaworthiness, whether it gives rise to a question for jury resolution or I might argue and certainly willing to argue that it gives rise to an issue of law that unquestionably, the facts were found as we submit them, unseaworthiness did exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.041" offset="2055502">Now I can see that here there was a dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.937" offset="2067101">An expert testimony -- tried, others testified and said -- we said that there was unseaworthiness that there was a regular custom and practice and need for three to four men to perform this job.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.857" offset="2114748">That fact issue was disputed by the defendants who said, every right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.592" offset="2137736">But we submit that that fact issue had to be submitted to the jury and had the jury found that three or four men were required to the performance of this particular task, then the jury should have been struck -- instructed and on those grounds they could return a verdict to the indigent seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.431" offset="2201057">Now the defendant's position was that we prove that the shipowner that there were a sufficient number of men overall aboard the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.969" offset="2243271">We prove that the Coast Guard had issued a certificate of inspection that required a certain number of able bodied seamen and ordinary seamen to be aboard the ship, some 12 or 15 as the -- that portion of the deck crew, and that we had now those number of men aboard the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.954" offset="2311189">Therefore, regardless of the proof and fact that at a particular time and place, at 1:30 in the afternoon on May 8, 1960 as the ship was docking at this Brooklyn pier, only two men were assigned for a particular task, and regardless of the facts that there was adequate proof that two men were not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.493" offset="2393318">When I say adequate, I mean adequate at least to go to jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.446" offset="2409200">Then, the matter must be dismissed as a matter of law because we had these other 13 to 15 men aboard the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.237" offset="2440338">And I submit that that is totally contrary to the clear position that this Court stated in the Mahnich decision, Mahnich v. Southern Steamship Companies, from 1944, where it said explicitly, that the fact that there were sufficient equipment aboard the vessel, sufficient and proper, does not mean that the ship cannot be found unseaworthy if at the particular time and place that the job function is carried out there is a defect or inadequacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.551" offset="2569592">In the Mahnich case, there was some rope lying in the bin, the officer just as here, there was a mate, the mate reached into the bin and pulled out some rope and its -- was set up for staging to hold a certain weight, certain staging.It turned out that that rope had a latent defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.648" offset="2649945">The mate was is no way negligent in selecting that rope.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.211" offset="2660185">He could not know that it had a latent defect hidden within it.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.945" offset="2675127">The staging collapsed and the seaman was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.834" offset="2686725">It was clearly stated by this case -- by this Court that although there was no negligence on the part of the mate and although there need be found no negligence on the part of the mate, and although the defect was completely latent and hidden, the fact that there was this insufficiency of the rope gave rise to condition of unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.500" offset="2765406">And further, this Court stated that although the -- there was proven to be a sufficient amount of safe and proper and non-defective rope aboard this very ship and so that the shipowner had indeed equipped the ship with sufficient proper rope, had sent it out on the seas with sufficient and proper rope, in no way but the claim of unseaworthiness because at the particular time and place the job function was carried out, improper, insufficient, inadequate rope was in fact used giving rise to the injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="739.849" offset="3062784">So manpower in a primitive way because no machinery could here do that job were being used where men were used in Mahnich and that was the -- that that's the difference, but other than that that, there is no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.730" offset="3114297">Now, there are enumerable occasions aboard ship and not on board ship when men must simply do the work.</text>

            <text syncTime="772.523" offset="3193501">Does Mahnich not reached where men's back instead of manufactured equipment are being used?</text>
            <text syncTime="779.875" offset="3222862">And I submit that there is no basis in law or logic or sense of justice for any such line to be drawn and there is no indicated case by this Court that suggests any such arbitrary cutoff of the beneficial doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.224" offset="3296319">This Court has frequently pointed out that the reason for this doctrine is that men go out on the seas and are exposed to certain kinds of routine hazards that do occur aboard ship.</text>

            <text syncTime="826.131" offset="3407914">There maybe occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.433" offset="3413138">But this is not such an unusual or particularly a strange circumstance, the fact that men will have to hold ropes or lines or weights aboard a ship is one of the most common occurrences aboard the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.448" offset="3465174">The ship is that -- I'm sure this Court is familiar, has many narrow areas, many stairways, many places and times when men's backs must do the physical labor and be exposed to certain hazards that can occur.</text>

            <text syncTime="1340.675" offset="5466049">This was a premature judicial dismissal of a claim that should've been submitted to a jury under a host of cases that had been decided by this Court particularly dealing with seamen's claims injured during their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.632" offset="5517876">Now, I want to refer very respectfully and very briefly to the Coast Guard Manning Regulations that are referred to by my adversary's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.626" offset="5561866">There was -- I think I referred to it before Coast Guard certificate, I think I've already indicated that these Coast Guard certificates do not pretend to lay down the number of men that have to be employed on a particular job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.327" offset="5612648">There are -- one certificate that are posted somewhere a mid-ship to say the ship shall have 12 able-bodied seamen and eight ordinary seamen, period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.440" offset="5645145">How many men should be on the rear gang and how many men should be mid-ship and how many men shall deal with a particular rope, the Coast Guard doesn't begin to attempt to deal with and obviously, if the mere fact that the Coast Guard certificate has been met, you could split all the men on vacation, have one man do all the jobs and say that there could be no unseaworthiness for insufficient manning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.624" offset="5725915">The insufficient manning per se is unquestionably been recognized as the grounds for unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.590" offset="5749739">We have only to this -- to reach the question in this Court I respectfully submit, as to whether the insufficient manning where the ship to leave the port without sufficient number of men is also to be found as imposing liability when the condition arises temporarily during the course of the work while the ship was on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.901" offset="5826957">And again, I submit, this Court held in Mitchell and is held time and time again that the fact that the condition is a temporary one and arises only during the course of the trip rather than at the inception when the ship leaves the port certainly does not excuse or exonerate the shipowner from liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.188" offset="5900100">Indeed I may say because, Mr. Justice Medina's -- excuse Judge Medina's opinion in the Second Circuit gave some passing reference to Mr. Justice Harlan's decision in the Dickson against United States written on the Second Circuit, in which as I recall it, the opinion raises the question as to whether the fact that the ship's unseaworthiness condition arises while the ship is on the high seas as distinct when the ship leaves the port might therefore not give rise to unseaworthiness liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.785" offset="6030503">And I think that the opinion below attempts to give continued application to that distinction when I think this Court in Mitchell very explicitly stated that the facts and the conditions is temporary and the fact that the condition arises when the ship is on the high seas as distinct from before it leaves the port does not exonerate and excuse the shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.572" offset="6125693">And so I think that what happened below was that an application of the doctrine that has already in Mitchell been laid to rest by this Court was sought to be imposed on one fragmentary area, where the insufficiency of manpower as distinct from equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.416" offset="6189014">And I think I've already spoke into that point as to the facts that there is an absolute equivalence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.227" offset="6212315">This Court has pointed out there's an absolute equivalence in the Boudoin and other cases between insufficiency of personnel and insufficiency equipment obviously in the regular course of work aboard the ship, men are sometimes called upon to do that which machinery cannot do and there should be no sharp or strange or unsupported division between the liabilities that should be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.987" offset="6307297">And I would respectfully with the Court's permission like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1590.807" offset="6466644">Soon after this Court granted certiorari in this case, Mr. Bamberger of the New York Times wrote sources on admiralty law expressed the view last week that the Supreme Court would establish a precedent of far reaching importance to shipowners if it upheld Mr. Waldron.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.147" offset="6567999">Such a decision may said, might upset current manning scales if damage awards were such as to make it advisable for a shipowner to assign a larger crew than is now normal to ship port tasks.</text>

            <text syncTime="1777.401" offset="7213014">Only in that there was testimony by plaintiff's witnesses who were experienced ship personnel that never before in the docking of this vessel had there been any order which required the use of this particular chuck which was some 56 feet away from the place where the aft mooring lines were coiled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.663" offset="7309981">It was slightly unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.454" offset="7325236">But to attempt to face up to Your Honor's question, I think the answer must or should be that if a vessel has aboard the number required by the Coast Guard for her safe navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.746" offset="7398379">And some incident, some not unusual incident occurs aboard vessel which requires assignment of some of those personnel then, the only way, the only theory upon which the plaintiff could recover would be that the mate or whoever it was who issued the order was negligent in not assigning more or conceivably less of the available ship's complement to perform a particular task.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.183" offset="7552084">Now, under the regulations pursuant to statute, the officer in charge of marine inspection is required to take into consideration many factors in determining the number of personnel required to safely navigate a ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.349" offset="7628779">The regulations attempt to list some of those many factors and then they run out of gas and use and et cetera to indicate the extensiveness of the factors which are and must be considered in determining the number of personnel required to safely man a vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.238" offset="7708296">During the course of the trial, there was evidence and an admission by plaintiff's expert that there are at least 25 common factors which must be taken into consideration, weighed, balanced and harmonized in determining how many men should be assigned to do any particular tasks during the course of a normal docking operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.556" offset="7821563">But notwithstanding all of these factors and considerations, plaintiff's expert testified in vacuo that “safe and prudent seamanship” required that three or four men be assigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.944" offset="7895124">Be assigned to do what?</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.244" offset="7904319">Be assigned to carry or drag 56-feet of brand new 8-inch manila line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.664" offset="7949981">But the record is perfectly clear, if Your Honors please, that even if that expert testimony were valid and sufficient to raise some jury question, plaintiff wasn't doing anything of that nature either before or at the time he was hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.906" offset="8030960">Plaintiff wasn't dragging or lifting 56-feet of line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.659" offset="8049977">What plaintiff was doing according to his own testimony which appears at page 10 of the record was, he was standing 10 feet away from a coil of line and he was attempting to flake out of that coil some additional line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.274" offset="8132420">And so at most, the plaintiff was attempting to partially support 10 feet and not 56 feet of new 8-inch manila line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.955" offset="8187173">There isn't any testimony or evidence in this case of any unsafe operation which is a phrase frequently employed in the briefs by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.786" offset="8234506">There wasn't any testimony of any custom to use any additional personnel as is implied by the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.107" offset="8267839">Indeed, the testimony is that the plaintiff with one other had put out two other mooring lines before he was ordered to put out this additional line.</text>

            <text syncTime="2180.160" offset="8824038">Now there of course is no evidence or reasonable inference in this case that this new 8-inch manila mooring line was unseaworthy or more particularly that it was unseaworthy unless three or four men used it, carried or dragged it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.118" offset="8935842">That I believe was what Redfern -- APL, American President Lines v. Redfern was all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.111" offset="8971786">There was involved a stuck valve which could only be “broken” by two men or by one man using a particular sort of a wrench, spanner wrench.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.614" offset="9045870">One man without wrench was sent down to break the stuck valve and in attempting to do so, he was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.183" offset="9092054">In other words, as I read Redfern and as Judge Medina obviously read it, that involved the case of equipment which was unseaworthy unless the additive of extra manpower or special equipment was furnished to sure, rectify, break the unseaworthy condition and thereby make this valve reasonably fit for its intended purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.558" offset="9237608">Now, were agreed that if the question presented is the one that I first stated, it has never been directly dealt with by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.150" offset="9284002">In addition to the decisions below, there are three other lower court cases which have dealt with the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.609" offset="9317857">They're cited on page 7 of my brief and all of them were decided in favor of the shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.661" offset="9350040">Judge Medina said and I believe quite correctly so, after obviously and exhaustive review of the applicable case law, that there are quote -- there is “no authority to the contrary” of the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.492" offset="9429347">Now to get back to Mr. Bamberger's observations, I believe he's wrong in suggesting that the decision in this case might impose upon shipowners an obligation to engage two or three times as many men to perform routine chores aboard ship as are now engaged pursuant to Coast Guard requirements, because that wouldn't do any good if Your Honors please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.552" offset="9569573">If they had a 150 men on a vessel which is now normally manned by 20, and for some reason, while 149 of them were standing around admiring the scenery, it became necessary to pick up a bucket or a tool and the mate assigned one of 150 potentially available crew members to do the job, that wouldn't permit the shipowner to escape liability if there were reversal in this case because some expert could always come along and would come along and testified that two or three or five men were needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.647" offset="9745951">So the mere addition by the shipowner of vast hordes of unneeded crewmembers aboard vessel wouldn't escape the consequences of reversal in this decision or conversely, if he had a 150 crewmembers aboard a 20-crew ship and out of extreme concern for the results of a -- this decision, the mate assigned 15 men to picked up the wrench, then of course that decision would run head on into what I believe Mr. Justice Harlan suggested with the expert testifying that this was a job which only one of the 150 men should have been assigned to do, and the vessel became unseaworthy because five men were assigned to do a one-man job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.612" offset="9969768">In other words, I suggest Your Honors that reversal in this case would make it incumbent upon the shipowner to attempt, which would be impossible, to see that in every instance the dozens or perhaps hundreds of orders which are issued aboard ship each day, in every case, the person giving the order would have to steer the perfect line between assigning too few and too many, and if he didn't, then the vessel regardless of how many people were aboard or available or how competent they might be, the shipowner would subjected to possible liability for unseaworthiness based upon high insight testimony of an expert in quotes who I suggest Your Honors, there isn't any deficiency or shortage of these people would always be found to testify that either more or less men should have been assigned to do every job.</text>

            <text syncTime="3043.559" offset="12277635">But to try to answer Your Honor's question of why, I believe it's because of the great number of quite technical factors which must be taken into consideration in determining how many men should and have to be as a matter of law assigned to navigate a particular vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.179" offset="12412113">In other words, their concepts of their construction concepts, their propulsion concepts, their concepts of the trade in which the vessel is in, their concepts of her age, her deadweight, the type of cargoes that she carries and as I say a great many other factors which result in the use of an etcetera in the regulations which the officer-in-charge, marine inspection must assemble, consider, weigh, before he decides how many should be required aboard various classes of vessels engaged in various trades and carrying various types of cargoes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3376.949" offset="13611133">With the Courts permission, I would like to speak directly to the question of the Coast Guard regulations that have been so heavily relied upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.836" offset="13650735">In the first place, I would like to point out that the record contains testimony on page 8, by the petitioner seaman himself that the job as a matter of regular custom, this particular job involved a minimum of three men.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.696" offset="13718131">And one man had to be at the chuck.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.112" offset="13727848">Now, Your Honor, the spring line, the line is going out, there's a tremendous amount of tension and pressure on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.227" offset="13748328">It is a heavy line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.516" offset="13753448">One man would be at the chuck letting the line out in controlling it otherwise it can become literally a snake aboard the vessel and cause all kinds of injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.910" offset="13790960">And two men must slog it and that is right on page 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.035" offset="13811545">Now, I advert to that particularly because there is this reference that it was -- and this without regard, it will happen to be an unusual chuck to use anywhere that such a spring line is being led out, be it a chuck a little farther forward or a little farther back, it involves those number of men, so testified by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.160" offset="13892002">Now, there is adversion to the fact that they were -- it was conceded that five men was the usual aft gang docking crew and five men were there provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.936" offset="13927111">That's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.101" offset="13931813">But it was also testified if you want to split it down, that usually three men at least will provide it before we even got to the expert testimony for this particular kind of operation and that was not met according to the petitioner's testimony in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.478" offset="13997328">My learned friend says, all of this is irrelevant provided there were 15 ABs and 12 OSs aboard the ship if that what the Coast Guard certificate posted in mid ships required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.050" offset="14047587">And I respectfully submit that he has not been able to and I've not been able to find a single iota of authority that suggest that that type of compliance with the overall Coast Guard regulations will suffice to deal with a job as it is performed at the particular time and place.</text>

            <text syncTime="3508.758" offset="14138389">What in -- suppose you had a jury, what instruction to the jury would you consider called for now on your theory of the case?</text>

            <text syncTime="3519.336" offset="14180707">The instruction would be that in the event the jury believed that the safe performance of this work required the use of three to four men because of the load and the tension and the manner in which this rope and line had to be handled, and in fact they find that less than three men were used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.322" offset="14276629">And they find that such failure to provide three men and the use of only two men contributed to causing the injuries complained of that they may find that the vessel, the shipowner is responsible in damages to the seaman injured during the course of his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.299" offset="14344547">And that Your Honor is precisely as I see it what seaworthiness liability is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.530" offset="14365445">The risks and the hazards of the maritime employment ought to be protected and accepted and compensated by the shipowner because of the standard concepts of risk sharing and risk distribution that have been enunciated and described by this Court in Seas Shipping Co. v.
