            <label>Mr. A. L. Wirin</label>
            <text syncTime="10.282" offset="144488">Chief Justice, may it please Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.246" offset="160371">I address myself first to answer an inquiry put to Mr. Pruitt by the Chief Justice and by Justice Fortas as to whether or not the provision which we are challenging that we challenged below, Section 26 of the California Constitution, includes or encompasses persons who determine to discriminate in the sale or rental of housing because of race based upon agreement with others, particularly agreements in the nature of restrictive covenants.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.437" offset="309164">My answer to the question of Your Honors is different from that given to you by Mr. Pruitt.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.556" offset="333615">The text of Section 26 appears as an appendix to the brief for the petitioners as do the valid arguments which were submitted to the voters in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.191" offset="392129">The first sheet or page in the appendix, right after the blue sheet from the brief for the petitioners contains the text of Section 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.597" offset="437791">Your Honors will find that the brief for the petitioners and the brief for respondents may carry the similar colors but they're quite different in thrust and in import so far as the arguments presented are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.413" offset="485021">This is called brief for petitioners and it has an appendix following a little blue sheet and the critical or significant provisions of this -- of this entire section is in the first paragraph and I merely refer to the last sentence in the first paragraph and to the phrase, “In his absolute discretion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="121.493" offset="589302">And it seems to me that a reading of that phrase stated as broadly as I think the English language permits in his absolute discretion, would certainly include an individual who in his own absolute discretion undertakes voluntarily to arrive in the -- to arrive an agreement with others.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.922" offset="679058">All of whom voluntarily agree to discriminate in housing because of race and thus the restrictive covenant.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.639" offset="709883">So, it seems to me that a reading of a provision on its face, moreover Your Honors, we challenged below and the court below was of the view that Section 26 is unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.661" offset="762023">Therefore, it seems to me what the provision says on its face is -- it is the first consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.830" offset="790653">Additionally Your Honors, this section, Section 26 in the fourth paragraph which is the last paragraph on the same sheet, undertakes with precision to carve out certain exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.512" offset="857422">These exemptions are with respect to the obtaining of property by eminent domain and with respect to accommodations for transients.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.111" offset="891800">So, when the writers of this provision intended to make exemptions, they were able to and succeeded in setting forth those exemptions with precision, no exemption so far as the unlimited, unrestrained, uncontrolled by the courts, authority of the individual to exercise his absolute discretion no matter the circumstances or the considerations which entered into his -- his own discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.257" offset="1016351">No such limitation appears on the face of the -- of the section.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.249" offset="1032338">Moreover Your Honors, I've stated Your Honors that the valid arguments are contained in this -- in this appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.860" offset="1066820">Your Honors will find nothing in the valid -- valid arguments which suggest any such exemption for persons who determine to discriminate in their absolute discretion based upon such agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.843" offset="1114781">And finally as to this narrow point, narrow or broad, in addition to the formal arguments which were submitted to the voters on -- to the voters, valid arguments and distributed by the Secretary of State which are attached as part of the appendix to the brief for the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.066" offset="1203597">There is an extended brief by one of amici, namely the United Auto Workers Union and I -- I state simply quickly for Your Honors' guidance, if it is, that attached as appendices to that brief, it is the gray brief, motion for -- by the United Auto Workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.164" offset="1276008">There are arguments made to the voters perhaps informally, but nonetheless circulated by the California Real Estate Association and its subordinate organizations, distributed and circulated by that organization to the voters stating the purpose and the meaning of Section 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.216" offset="1364198">And nowhere in any of the arguments presented to the voters, even informally is there any suggestion that the limitation suggested by Mr. Pruitt maybe -- maybe read into this section.</text>

            <text syncTime="505.750" offset="2126346">But if he decides to adhere to the provisions of the agreement, it seems to me because Section 26 broadsidedly prohibits any agency of the State of California which includes a judge thereon from inquiring into the nature of or the basis for the exercise of absolute discretion by the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.678" offset="2214118">It seems to me that in such a circumstance, a court under this -- this provision is foreclosed from inquiring into the existence of an agreement or the nature of the agreement or whether or not the individual discriminates because of the agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="550.615" offset="2305860">Yes, yes, and of course my -- my complaint is that it is foreclosed in the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.550" offset="2337520">Now in additionally Your Honors, Mr. Pruitt stated to you to the Court yesterday that it was his view that this provision applies to what he called individual action, the exercise of discretion by the individual and does not apply to action in -- by individuals acting in concert, kind of a corollary to the problem of persons agreeing in connection to -- to have restrictive covenants.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.162" offset="2464057">Now here again Your Honors, there is nothing on the face of Section 26 since on the face of it, it provides that an individual may exercise his absolute discretion in determining whether or not to discriminate because of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.344" offset="2516720">There is nothing in that section which bars an individual from cooperating with others, in concert or otherwise, in effectuating racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.547" offset="2561546">And there is not -- there is no such exception in the -- in the Section 26 and no such exception is suggested in the valid arguments and no such exception is suggested by the California Real Estate Association to sponsor for this proposal in the arguments made which were distributed to the voters which as I have indicated are next to the brief of the Auto Workers Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.507" offset="2653393">Now moreover, if I may say so to Your Honors, if it is true, if Mr. Pruitt is correct in his statement to this Court, that this provision, Section 26, does not affect persons engaging in discrimination or -- as a result of acting in concert, then Your Honors are confronted with the following situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.317" offset="2764675">The judgment of the Supreme Court of California and Your Honor, this Court reviews judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.066" offset="2791633">That judgment merely ordered reverse the judgment of the Superior Court of Orange County.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.656" offset="2817964">That judgment barred the plaintiff from having a trial on his complaint on the ground that the courts of California by Section 26 were barred from -- from permitting any relief in connection with alleged racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.446" offset="2893197">Now Your Honors will find in the record at page 4, the complaint which the trial court ruled, stated no cause of action and accorded no right to power, the Court to grant relief and particularly paragraph 8 of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.436" offset="2969161">And Your Honors will find that in paragraph 8 at page 4 of the Reitman, of the multi-complaint against Reitman.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.433" offset="3009076">He alleges not only acts of discrimination by the owners and by the -- by the Reitman.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.047" offset="3043558">He alleges that the discrimination which the defendants participated in is also practiced by other real estate brokers and home and landowners and so forth and owners -- in Orange County and throughout California.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.331" offset="3108655">Now it may be this complaint does -- certainly this complaint doesn't use the word concert, but it certainly undertakes to allege the actions of others as constituting a practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.029" offset="3155466">That means that a practice often is engaged in -- when persons act in concert.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.651" offset="3182007">So, therefore, if Your Honors accept the view of counsel for the petitioners that Section 26 does not apply to action in concert and since the cases here merely as a result of a sustaining of a motion to dismiss as it were by the trial court, minimally, it is my argument, this Court should affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of California or dismiss the petition as -- as a -- I guess the phrase is improvidently granted or whatever it is.</text>

            <text syncTime="811.857" offset="3350758">Mr. Pruitt has gone off the record.I make no criticism on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.915" offset="3367058">That the apartment building involved in the Reitman case had 10 units.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.062" offset="3399659">In fact I have checked on it and he is correct, but moreover, the complaint alleges that the Reitmans owned -- well, he didn't say this exactly -- virtually says it, have owned other apartment buildings and I am informed and I say this for what it is worth in the Court that the Reitmans, the petitioners here and defendants below are a large institution owning and managing numerous apartment houses in Orange County and constitute one of the largest apartment house owners and operators in Orange County.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.629" offset="3569873">Now I say this to you Your Honors simply to say that if Your Honors were to follow my argument and affirm the judgment of the -- of the Supreme Court of California, the effect would be merely to permit the plaintiffs to proceed with proof of their complaint including paragraph 8 in the complaint and maybe they can prove what I have just said to Your Honors, I believe are the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.426" offset="3669034">Now I turn however to what I think is the critical issue in this case and that is whether or not Section 26, both on its face and in terms of its legislative history is no more than a repeal of earlier provisions of state law, whether or not in adopting Section 26, California played the role of neutrality, I think the phrase this Court has used, Mr Justice White has used is the role of strict neutrality.</text>

            <text syncTime="1785.602" offset="7245824">Had this been an initiative which was written into a statute of California, they still would be required another initiative in order to get rid of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.694" offset="7290128">Why then Your Honors and I ask this in parallel to the questions, was this provision written into the Constitution of California?</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.966" offset="7323251">Why was it put into Article 1 of the Constitution of California which is the Declaration of Rights of California?</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.422" offset="7357106">Because it was intended by those who wanted it to elevate the right of discrimination into a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.277" offset="7392528">Now when a matter becomes one of constitutional right as for example when the right of freedom of speech is provided for in a constitution, it is intended and expected that it will encourage persons to exercise freedom of speech.And when a provision is enshrined in a state constitution, it is intended and in my opinion has the inevitably effect of encouraging persons to engage in the discrimination which is affirmatively sanctioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1861.067" offset="7547591">Well by this -- excuse me Mr. Wirin, but by this action the people of California, I suppose it's arguable, have removed from the ordinary legislative process, this subject of legislation in the field of discrimination with respect to rental, lease, or sale of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.345" offset="7640795">And they have similarly, if I understand the argument, have removed that subject from the jurisdiction of their courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.017" offset="7679457">Now the question is, whether that removal of this subject from the ordinary state processes is state action within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1915.552" offset="7765556">Now, perhaps similarly I suppose that if the Federal Government passed a statute on this subject with respect to discrimination in housing and the area of this section that the effect of this constitutional provision would mean that regardless of what the legislature of California might want to do, that California could not -- the California courts could not cooperate in the enforcement of the federal statute by virtue of their jurisdiction without saying that the resolution is pro tanto and valid as in conflict with the federal law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="2177.612" offset="8813798">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.We appeared today as amicus in these cases because we believe that the two of them represents serious and far-reaching questions regarding the extent to which states may by indirect means substantially contribute to invidious discrimination of a kind which if practiced directly would certainly clearly violate the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.548" offset="8941589">Now, the subject matter of the state constitutional provision involved here against the discrimination in the sales and rental of housing is an addition of subsequent concern to the executive branch of our government as is indicated by present proposals for legislation on the federal level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.272" offset="9028420">These cases concerned the validity of formal legal action taken by the State of California with respect to discrimination in housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.202" offset="9076172">And in our view, the action so taken goes beyond constitutional bounds.The provision of the state constitution which I would prefer to just call “Proposition 14” because that's the way it's commonly accepted and designated throughout the State of California, is we believe demonstrably an exercise of state power in support of racial discrimination as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.148" offset="9199992">In support of this conclusion, we have urged three lines of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.323" offset="9220681">One I proposed to deal very briefly because it's already been discussed by -- a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.957" offset="9251192">The rest is essentially on the principle set forth in Mr. Justice Stewart's concurring opinion in the Burton case -- the Wilmington case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.651" offset="9289958">And although they had believed he and Mr. Justice Frankfurter and Mr. Justice Harlan believed it was not applicable to the facts of the case they still agreed with this principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.029" offset="9339486">And that principle, as I understand it is that a state may not solemnly enact into law an explicit official authorization of racial exclusion or racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.055" offset="9395597">That is true because such an enactment by its very nature puts the state on the side of racial distinctions and racial discriminations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.095" offset="9443767">Aside to which the state simply may not, under the Fourteenth Amendment tip the scales even by a hair's breadth, that's what Burton tells me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.135" offset="9495907">The proposition that a state must maintain the strictest neutrality with respect to private racial discrimination has of course been firmly established and is recently in Anderson against Martin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.080" offset="9555675">And in light of its history, this history of pro -- Proposition 14 which was so fully discussed in the opinion of the Supreme Court of California, and the briefs here, there can be little doubt that it actually enshrines as it carefully secured and preferred right of California citizens, a preferred right because it was deliberately put in the section with rights of free speech, free exercise of religion, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.410" offset="9689004">And for that reason, we come to the second line in this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.862" offset="9714813">And that emphasizes that Proposition 14 is not merely a state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.264" offset="9740413">It's not a statute which is subject to the ordinary interplay of political pressures within the jurisdiction of what remains the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.879" offset="9778866">And I say in the question as to the difference between this being a constitutional provision or a statute, the important point is it can only be removed by a vote of the people of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.914" offset="9846993">And the people we are arguing about here are the underprivileged people in the State of California and I don't think anybody denied that you don't get referendum by any place without hard earned cash and plenty of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.431" offset="9929122">The whole level of political acumen in California as in any other places makes it possible that a minority group may have some political strength in an area here or an area there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.568" offset="10001638">But in no state that I know of do the minority groups have statewide power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.328" offset="10032671">And that's the reason it's important to recognize that this provision was deliberately put into the constitution, it was no accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.165" offset="10076035">And I agree that if it just had been a repeal, we would not be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.983" offset="10099336">The permanence it has as a constitutional provision and the sweeping effect which it must be given its all inclusive prohibition by local governmental agencies distinguishes it from a simple statute, declaring the state's neutrality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.829" offset="10162657">I -- I don't understand this argument that all it does is to say, “Well, everybody's free.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.995" offset="10191391">But incorporating Proposition 14 in the constitution, California said that legislation of governmental action of any sort may not be taken to eliminate or reduce private racial discrimination in housing unless one, either two-thirds of the legislature move or the issue is put up to vote by the majority of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.096" offset="10287731">Racial and other minorities and classes which are the likely victims of discrimination in housing are virtue -- by virtue of their minority status itself, placed in an obvious disadvantage.</text>
