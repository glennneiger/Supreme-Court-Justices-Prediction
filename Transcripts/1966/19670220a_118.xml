            <text syncTime="37.810" offset="254621">This case brings back to this Court questions arising out of the factual context of the illegal raids, arrests and seizures of the records and membership lists of our Southern Civil Rights Organization which was the background for this Court's decision in Dombrowski against Pfister in the October '64 term.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.174" offset="344064">The complaint in this case charge the conspiracy between these respondents, Senator James Eastland, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Internal Security of the Senate and J.G. Sourwine, the committee counsel, and several Louisiana state officials including Mr. Pfister, the Chairman of Un-American Activities committee of the Louisiana -- joint committee of the Louisiana Legislature and several Louisiana police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.297" offset="476557">To -- under the cover of Louisiana anti-subversive laws, this is a law struck down as unconstitutional by this Court in Dombrowski, to utilize illegal police raids, arrests and seizures, all in violation of the Fourth Amendment in order of the complaint charges to seize records and lists of names of members and supporters of this civil rights organization which records and lists of names would have been impossible or extremely difficult for these legislative co-conspirators to obtain lawfully under this Court's own decisions in NAACP against Alabama to recently in Gibson against Florida as the Court is of course aware.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.667" offset="686059">Since NAACP against Alabama, the Court has stressed constantly the chilling effect upon constitutional rights of citizen of a demand for list of names of supporters of Southern Negro Movements for Equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.331" offset="752724">Now, the complaint charges that the plan and conspiracy was all for the purpose of harassing these plaintiffs and discouraging them and their supporters from asserting and attempting to vindicate the rights of Negro citizens of Louisiana in the Deep South.</text>

            <text syncTime="277.471" offset="1213210">Those very specific facts of their participation in the initiation of the conspiracy emerged in respondents' own motion for summary judgment, their own affidavits and the testimony of respondents Sourwine on deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.077" offset="1271724">Very specific facts emerged as to their participation in what this Court called in the General Motors case, a joint collaboration in the initiation of the original conspiracy.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.357" offset="1352808">Certainly, the facts which emerged from the affidavits and from their own respondent, Sourwine's testimony were these following facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.480" offset="1401292">In the summer 1963, certain private discussions took place between respondent Sourwine and one of the co-conspirators, Rogers who was the -- one of the counsels to the alleged Louisiana Joint Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.177" offset="1468061">During this private correspondence -- private discussions the question of the availability of the records and membership list of the civil rights organization were discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.174" offset="1520097">That's July '63, fact one, uncontested by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.928" offset="1539114">Secondly, the plan not to use the legislative subpoena but to use the police raids instead to seize the records emerged in late August or early September according to their own testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.688" offset="1614137">And there's a very interesting affidavit which emerged in the Louisiana branch of this litigation which is an appendix to our brief, an affidavit from one of Louisiana co-conspirators which pinpoints the plan at a meeting in late August in ‘63 which they developed what they called operation cheap talk to see the --</text>

            <text syncTime="405.178" offset="1724061">The next fact which emerges from the record is after the plan had gelled, another private discussion took place in the middle of September between Sourwine and between Rogers.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.652" offset="1789994">This is after the plan had gelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.214" offset="1800234">A private discussion took place in which they further discussed the civil rights organization's records.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.306" offset="1832626">Shortly thereafter, the record shows, shortly thereafter, the plan was put into operation and Sourwine in his own testimony -- I'm sorry, Rogers in his own testimony describes the development of the plan, the seizures then took place shortly thereafter on October 4th.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="454.330" offset="1920711">Do you say that if allowed to go to trial, you'll be able to prove that the defendant, Sourwine at that conference participated in a plan to use the police power and search warrants rather than subpoenas?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arthur_kinoy" startTime="469.647" stopTime="708.372">
            <label>Mr. Arthur Kinoy</label>
            <text syncTime="469.647" offset="1981942">Absolutely, Justice Fortas.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.364" offset="1988838">And I would say that the measurements, the yardstick for the type of evidence required to go to trial on this issue and the conspiracy question which the Court discussed last term in General Motors per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.056" offset="2043591">We are not required, as the government was not required in General Motors to prove explicit agreements in the conspiracy, and as the Court pointed out in the CBS case in Poller against CBS.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.817" offset="2090611">Now in the summary judgment question, it is impossible when a conspiracy, where the evidence is securely in the hands of the co-conspirators and hostile witnesses to show explicit agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.353" offset="2132825">I would suggest that on these facts, the Court has never had a sharper case in which there was evidence at least requiring ads.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.346" offset="2172740">I would like to point out to you Justice Fortas that this -- the Circuit Court here, the District of Columbia found that on this issue of whether or not these respondents were participants in the plan on the conspiracy, that Circuit Court here found that there were disputed issues of facts which would require resolution by trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.166" offset="2276080">It's very interesting in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.693" offset="2286111">The Circuit Court disagreed with the respondents on their major thrust to the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.248" offset="2308368">The main thrust of the argument of the respondents below was they had an alternative position, a) that we had not put forward a serious claim that these respondents as Justice Fortas asked the question were participants in the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.747" offset="2374405">That was their main argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.024" offset="2379421">And summary judgment should be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.263" offset="2388407">They had an alternative argument that even if they were participants in the conspiracy, even if they had participated in the illegal police seizures and raids, nevertheless the doctrine of legislative immunity protected them.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.868" offset="2450892">It was an alternative argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.738" offset="2458311">Now, in the court below, in the per curiam opinion what is so interesting here, the posture of the case now before this Court is that the court below rejected their main contention and said, “Were that the only issue in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="605.855" offset="2526751">Then we would be constraint to have great difficulty to find that there were not disputed issues of facts upon involving their participation in the conspiracy which would require exploration by a trial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="622.077" offset="2591640">So that the respondents are here before this Court in effect asking this Court to reject the conclusion of the lower court that as to the Court and Justice Fortas asked, there are sufficient disputed issues to require retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.369" offset="2652871">Now, if I can give another example Justice Fortas which led the District -- the Circuit Court to the conclusion that there had to be a trial to resolve these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.612" offset="2697801">Take the formulations in the General Motors case, not only in respect to the initiation of the conspiracy in respect to its execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.545" offset="2733537">I would suggest that there is more than adequate evidence here to show the joint collaboration of the co-conspirators to execute it.Now, what does this record show?</text>
            <text syncTime="670.039" offset="2783483">It shows the most extraordinary maneuver which took place on October 4th in New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.082" offset="2811695">In 24 hours, the following things happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.407" offset="2829040">As a result of the plan, operation cheap talk, as a result of the plan to use police machinery to seize these records, the police came in and as this Court knows in Dombrowski, Pfister where the description of the raids are set forth, grabbed all of the records, everything in the offices of the organization and Mr. Smith is watching the lawyers.</text>

            <text syncTime="734.890" offset="3042931">Now, the immediate effect of the police seizures was to deprive the civil rights organization of any opportunity to defend against a legislative subpoena of these records by doing the conventional thing of coming in to quash the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.055" offset="3131643">They couldn't do it because the police grabbed it immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.539" offset="3145540">But then look what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.080" offset="3151705">Instantaneously, the records were then turned over to the Louisiana Committee with the subpoena all prepared for forthwith production of everything seized and then that night, the record shows, and this I think Justice Fortas goes to your question again.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.708" offset="3242193">That night, the record shows that Rogers got on the telephone to Sourwine, said, “Alright, we've got the records, come on down to Louisiana.”</text>
            <text syncTime="796.047" offset="3287542">The next morning, Sourwine arrives in Louisiana with blank subpoenas signed by the Chairman but completely in blank.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.060" offset="3327561">Subpoenas incidentally as the argument will later show, totally unauthorized by the Senate Committee itself and these subpoenas are then copied verbatim from the Louisiana subpoena which in turn was copied verbatim from the warrant of arrest later declared of course totally illegal and violative of the Fourth Amendment, in other words, they wrote out general warrants, warrants of assistance right then and there.</text>

            <text syncTime="836.343" offset="3448769">Rogers was the counsel to the Louisiana Legislative Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.119" offset="3475832">I asked the Court to consider what happened in that 24 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.047" offset="3487535">On the one hand, the organization and the plaintiffs were deprived of the right, the ability to defend against the legislative subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.193" offset="3528182">At the end of the 24 hours, they were deprived of their opportunity to use the criminal processes to go in and move to quash and vacate the warrant and to ask for a return of the books and records because at the end of the 24 hours from the police they were then in the hands of a legislative committee and that is in effect what happened because incidentally this was all secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.712" offset="3654196">Nobody knew anything about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.724" offset="3662242">It all came out two weeks later, when we went into the Louisiana State Court and we moved to vacate the warrants of arrest and this motion was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.691" offset="3722115">The grant there was not probable cause for the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.174" offset="3732041">We then got up and we said, alright, we ask the state court to order that the books and records and membership lists be returned to the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.791" offset="3774568">At that moment, for the first time, we learned about this 24-hour maneuver.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.306" offset="3796616">Because at that moment the state officials got up and said, “We're very sorry, we cannot return these books and records because they are, although physically here in Louisiana, they are in the custody of Senator Eastland, and we cannot return them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="942.588" offset="3873729">The state court said, “I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do about it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="946.293" offset="3888567">And the books and records were not returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.040" offset="3899538">Then the third phase of the conspiracy unquoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.757" offset="3914376">That was the first time anybody, ourselves or the pubic, knew about the activities of these respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.519" offset="3941439">It's very significant I think that it was a secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.488" offset="3953351">Normally, a senate committee when it subpoenaed something, normally, it's in the newspapers, they'll issue a press release, this was very secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.585" offset="3985742">We didn't know about it until that state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.324" offset="3996714">So what did we do?</text>
            <text syncTime="975.299" offset="4004551">We then went into the Federal District Court that was on Friday, the state decision came down Saturday.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.821" offset="4034644">We went into the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.616" offset="4041853">We instituted the first what I would call, the Louisiana branch of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.919" offset="4067035">We instituted an action identical to this action in the Federal District Court in Louisiana asking for damages, the illegal searches and seizures, and for the return of the books and records injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.075" offset="4123669">Saturday, the complaint was filed in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.825" offset="4138715">Sunday morning, we appeared before Federal District Judge then Federal District Judge Ainsworth and ask for a temporary restraining order to issue against the turning over of these records physically because they were still in the State of Louisiana to these respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.739" offset="4214366">The judge then asked the Louisiana officials who were in that court, “Can I have your assurances that these records are in Louisiana?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.555" offset="4257625">And they said, “Yes, they're in Baton Rouge.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1042.599" offset="4273716">All in the record they come out of the testimony of Mr. Sourwine and affidavits and I believe they are uncontested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.470" offset="4309243">At that point, the judge told us, “Send a telegram to the respondents including Senator Eastland.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.033" offset="4339545">A telegram which says, “I'm sending down this TRO for a hearing tomorrow morning, Monday morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.461" offset="4369220">And the TRO will involve an injunction to restrain turning these records claimed to be illegally seized over to you and I request your presence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.294" offset="4424600">The telegram went to Senator Eastland that in Sourwine's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.783" offset="4442467">That was Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.629" offset="4449886">At 10 O'clock Sunday night, Senator Eastland, respondent here, got that telegram.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.494" offset="4473396">He then got on the telephone to respondent Sourwine and these are Sourwine's words, not ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.513" offset="4509445">Senator Eastland then told Sourwine, “Get those records out of Louisiana.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.923" offset="4531075">Sourwine protested, “It was hard to do it that night.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.659" offset="4546017">He said, “Well, take them across the state line to Mississippi, to Woodville, Mississippi.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.878" offset="4574856">Sourwine then called one of the Louisiana state officials also a co-defe -- codefendant in the actions and said, “Get those records out of Louisiana.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.552" offset="4641625">At 12 O'clock that night, a van arrived in Baton Rouge, took all of the records, membership lists and everything else out of Louisiana across, I think the Court can take notice that Woodville, Mississippi is across the state boundary, took those records into Woodville, Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.208" offset="4724172">The next morning we appeared in Federal Judge Ainsworth's courtroom in response to the TRO.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.800" offset="4746533">And when the judge called the matter to be heard, the state officials got up and said, “We're very sorry Your Honor, the books and records are no longer in the jurisdiction of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.681" offset="4802121">They are out of the jurisdiction of the Federal District of Louisiana,” where I ask this Court what possible inferences can be drawn from that conduct?</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.210" offset="4840260">Surely on a motion for summary judgment, we are entitled to draw on inference of a) guilty knowledge on the part of these respondents, that the books and records were illegally seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.441" offset="4889161">Surely, we are entitled to draw an inference that in addition to that, these respondents were attempting to pursue the objectives of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.464" offset="4929181">I would suggest that short of actual confessions in the record, it would be difficult to conceive of further evidence which would -- would require to withstand a motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.006" offset="4979440">Now, there has never been an explanation for this extraordinary conduct of that Sunday evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.546" offset="5005563">One explanation Sourwine suggested on his deposition that the Federal District Court didn't have jurisdiction anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.246" offset="5040358">Well, I would suggest to the Court that we don't have to explore very fully that response, perfectly easy for an attorney to go into the Federal District Judge's chambers the next morning and say “Your Honor, you can issue any temporary restraining order but you have no jurisdiction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.556" offset="5105560">I would suggest that perhaps the real motivations emerged from respondents Sourwine, the admission in the testimony that he did it because he thought and these were his words, he would be in an awkward situation, if the records were not removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.652" offset="5193958">Now, I suggest to the Court that there was more than -- that this was the reason why the District Court -- the circuit court below rejected out of their hand the respondent's contention that there was not sufficient evidence to go to trial and the issue with their participation of the conspiracy --</text>

            <text syncTime="1348.101" offset="5495724">At the luncheon recess, I had remarked that in this Court, the respondents have seem to shift the main thrust of their position back to in effect urging the Court to reject the conclusion on the factual record of the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.964" offset="5575241">Now, this shift may in certain respects be due to the intervening impact of a series of decisions in the Fifth Circuit in the parallel Louisiana litigation which I would suggest to the Court may throw considerable light on the problems presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.736" offset="5654340">In that parallel litigation instituted in the Federal District Court in Louisiana, defendant Pfister who is the Chairman of the Un-American Activities Committee of the Louisiana legislature moved for summary judgment on the -- in an identical complaint, on the ground that he was protected by doctrine of legislative immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.758" offset="5754441">Judge Ainsworth rejected the motion for summary judgment on the ground that there was a disputed fact as to Pfister's participation in the plan and the raids, that these disputed fact as to its participation in the raids, raised a question as to whether Judge Ainsworth said, his activity, which he is charged in the complaint, was legitimate legislative activity within the meaning of this Court's decision in Tenney-Brandhove.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.033" offset="5919535">Then a very curious thing happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.807" offset="5930611">Pfister interpleaded as third party defendants, all of the members of the Louisiana legislative committee saying that he was responsible, so were they.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.642" offset="5985991">They came in before Judge Ainsworth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.452" offset="5997171">They move to for summary judgment also on the ground they were protected by the doctrine of legislative immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.175" offset="6032071">Judge Ainsworth granted their motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.907" offset="6047013">Pfister then appealed that decision to the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.256" offset="6072404">And this November, November 1966, the Fifth Circuit in an opinion by Circuit Judge Wisdom, reversed the granting of summary judgment as to the members of the legislative committee in an opinion which I would suggest puts its finger upon the conceptual confusion which I think is present in the Circuit Court's opinion in the District of Columbia in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.144" offset="6219943">Judge Wisdom pointed out in Arceneaux against Pfister, we have included for the Court's convenience Judge Wisdom's written opinion as an appendix to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.358" offset="6264769">Judge Wisdom made the following analysis, and he said, “There are disputed issues of facts as to whether these third party defendants had any knowledge of the plan to use police raids, or participated in any way in the planning and initiation and carrying out of this conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.725" offset="6386291">There is a disputed issue of fact as to that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.174" offset="6400084">That in turn, Judge Wisdom pointed out, not only precludes a motion for summary judgment as to their participation in the conspiracy but precludes a motion for summary judgment as to their defense of legislative immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.485" offset="6485347">Because Judge Wisdom then pointed out that the issue of their participation in the conspiracy undisputed issue raises he said an issue as to whether or not this is legitimate legislative activity within the meaning of this Court's decision in Tenney and to drive this point home, Judge Wisdom italicized in the opinion the word ‘legitimate' in the quotation from the Court's opinion in Tenney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.860" offset="6638843">Accordingly, the Fifth Circuit reversed ordered that these defendants also must stand trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.512" offset="6673429">Now, what is the situation therefore in the parallel Louisiana litigation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.815" offset="6694640">These cases are on the ready-jury calendar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.434" offset="6709060">To make it perfectly clear that the cases must go to trial, Judge Ainsworth granted a permissive appeal to Pfister from the denial of his motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.188" offset="6764126">That went to the Fifth Circuit, and the Fifth Circuit dismissed the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.161" offset="6783979">All of the Louisiana officials including the legislative officials will stand trial in Federal District Court in Louisiana, in the cases on the ready-jury calendar.</text>

            <text syncTime="1814.913" offset="7363062">There are two factual situations here and I wonder if you make a distinction between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.839" offset="7398693">First is the alleged participation in the unlawful search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.408" offset="7428995">The second is the alleged unlawful improper or whatever, how do you style it, action with respect to the picking of the documents while a proceeding was pending in the Court of Judge Ainsworth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.365" offset="7492838">Now, my question to you is whether for purposes of the legislative immunity problem, you make a distinction between those two.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur Kinoy</label>
            <text syncTime="1857.207" offset="7532231">Oh!</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.357" offset="7532753">Justice Fortas, no, I would make no distinction because for the purposes of the immunity doctrine, neither of the two phases which you described would be sufficient to invoke the doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.103" offset="7583744">The respondents suggest that the latter phase, the use of the unauthorized subpoena in some way is sufficient to invoke the doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.399" offset="7632959">My suggestion to that is that the short answer to that is Kilbourn-Thompson, and every subsequent decision of this Court on the immunity question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.833" offset="7674755">In Kilbourn which this Court in the Gojack decision just last term, so a reason to describe as the leading case on the subject, in Kilbourn, the warrant of arrest did not serve to immunize the sergeant at arms from tort liability for the wrongful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.492" offset="7773288">Similarly here, the subpoenas are insufficient to immunize the respondents from tort liability for the illegal searches and seizures for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.239" offset="7852283">First, a search and seizure itself, in violation of the Fourth Amendment is as the Court described in the Stanford case, the same term that Dombrowski-Pfister was decided, search and seizure of this nature, Stanford very interesting case because it involved a raid identical to this raid, a raid under the anti-subversive laws of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.226" offset="7952280">And this Court described that raid, the same thing happened, they took all the books and records, everything from the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.348" offset="7976730">The Court described this raid as a constitutionally impermissible act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.509" offset="8009435">Now, if this kind of a raid on a general warrant, is a constitutionally impermissible act, it is no less or constitutionally impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.354" offset="8056769">It's in the same caliber as the warrant of arrest in Kilbourn which the Court said was not sufficient to immunize the sergeant in Kilbourn-Thompson from a suit for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.070" offset="8115702">Now, secondly, we have a situation in which the subpoenas issued in blank were themselves violative of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.844" offset="8162722">Now, that is the problem which the respondents have not coped with because the incredible aspect of the record is that these subpoenas in blank which were filled out that morning in Baton Rouge were copied identically from the state subpoena which was based upon the criminal warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.740" offset="8258330">These were stricken and the Court remarked in Dombrowski-Pfister, these were stricken as illegal, violative of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.133" offset="8291871">They were like the warrants in Stanford.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.714" offset="8302216">They were what the Court in Stanford called absolutely identical to general warrants, the writs of assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.909" offset="8331055">Now it, I would suggest to the Court, is impossible to assert that the use of a general warrant or a writ of assistance is legitimate legislative activity in any sense of the work and as the Court pointed out in Stanford, not since the statement of James Otis in the revolutionary period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.625" offset="8425827">Has any court in this country has any legislative body ever suggested that the use of a general warrant, a writ of assistance could conceivably be considered legitimate legislative activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.239" offset="8496358">Now, thirdly, the blank subpoenas which incidentally now are the only shred these respondents hold to on adoption of legislative immunity here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.052" offset="8555604">They don't assert as they did below that if they really participated in the illegal searches and seizures that they initiated, planned or helped it along as we discussed earlier this morning, they don't really assert that adoption of legislative immunity could protect that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.607" offset="8625821">That's difficult to assert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.000" offset="8635329">The only shred of holding to the doctrine is the use of this subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.071" offset="8663646">But the subpoena itself not only is illegal, violative of the Fourth Amendment as the writ of assistance but was totally unauthorized by the committee itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2212.827" offset="8954650">This is a question which can be cured, would later cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.099" offset="8979728">I would suggest that the suggestion that the unauthorized use of a subpoena in the area of investigation into the rights of citizens under the First Amendment is no minor technical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.244" offset="9052348">From the decisions of this Court in Watkins, to the decisions last term in Gojack, it seems clear that the Court has said that as a minimum, as a minimal out of boundary of legislative power in the area of the use of compulsory process to investigate into activities associations of citizen within the framework of the First Amendment as an outer minimal boundary, the Court has directed the concept of the requirements of authorization for such legislative activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.615" offset="9237817">Now, this is no minor technical question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.008" offset="9255372">In Watkins, this Court said, that that requirements of authorization went to the heart of the preservation of limited constitutional government that at a minimum putting aside the impact of an authorized subpoena upon the exercise of the First Amendment right that at the minimum the exerci -- the use of the requirement of authorization chartered the out of boundaries, the outer boundaries of legislative power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.814" offset="9398627">It would seem therefore that far from being a technical question, the use of a subpoena is so violative of the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2408.441" offset="9737174">Under Gojack and on the other decisions of this Court and I would point out Justice Fortas also that in the examination of the resolution of the Senate committee there is some question even about that which we were not permitted to fully litigate in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.635" offset="9789942">Senator Keating raised the question about whether or not the ratification actually took place and that sort to take the deposition of Senator Keating but I could not get an adjournment in trying to take that, but putting aside that, in the examination of the resolution itself, very interesting because the resolution does not specifically say that we authorize the issuance of that subpoena or we think that subpoena was properly authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.234" offset="9892342">All the resolution says that these documents which we now have here can be put in our record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.892" offset="9926928">And after they put in our record, they should be sent back to New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.907" offset="9943019">So I would suggest that even on that level there was no direct authorization but I do not rest on that, because I think it -- it doesn't go to the question of why authorization is so critically required in this entire area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.078" offset="10007698">Now, I would suggest then that any effort to invoke the legislative immunity doctrine here runs in the face of this Court's own definitions from Kilbourn to United Stated against Johnson itself as to the limits which must be fenced around the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.779" offset="10142490">I find it helpful for example, the opinion of the English Courts in Stockdale-Hansard which this Court in Kilbourn said represented the basis of the thinking that went into the immunity concept itself, to the clause itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.156" offset="10208005">And in Stockdale, the Court will recall, the English Court felt that it was essential if the liberties of citizens are to be protected if the double pole which is exercised in the emergence of the immunity, one pole toward the independence and free speech of the legislature, the other pole for the protection of the rights of citizens to exercise fundamental liberties and to be protected by a remedy in the Court of Law against infringement of those liberties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.694" offset="10358157">If those two poles are to be reconciled and they must be, said the Court in Stockdale and this Court in Kilbourn, then we must as the English Court said, we must fence in the privilege by the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.172" offset="10428061">That is our responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.864" offset="10434853">We must fence in the privilege by the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.726" offset="10446242">And the Court did that in Kilbourn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.752" offset="10458363">And the Court said that the illegal act of arrest does not protect the sergeant of arms and a money judgment will lie and was later, actually collected against the sergeant of arms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.879" offset="10522937">Secondly, the Court, Justice Miller said in Kilbourn, if the members of the Congress themselves had participated in the arrest in anyway, he says, they would be liable as the sergeant of arms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.790" offset="10594513">They are protected for what?</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.738" offset="10602350">Only the pure legislative act, the passage of the resolution authorized, that alone says the Justice in Kilbourn would protect them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2692.066" offset="10871620">Then clearly that is the line, that is where the law offenses in the immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2803.926" offset="11319045">I don't want to spend very much time on that except to point out that from, that the doctrine and concept which this Court developed in bar, a judicially constructed doctrine grounded on the principles and concepts of the common law, points an answer to this problem in the common law because in the classic case involving remedies for searches and seizures, Entick against Carrington, the English Court not only found for the plaintiff on an action but permitted damages against his majesty, Secretary of State, an order that damages issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.768" offset="11498454">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.509" offset="11501380">Because the English Court in Entick said in Carrington that the interest in preserving the fundamental liberties of the citizen, the subject in that case is such a deep-seated requirement that a remedy and damages far from interfering with the operations of government is essential if government is going to what?</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.764" offset="11614438">Is going to view two constitutional lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.272" offset="11632410">And I would point out to the Court that in recent decisions of the Circuit Courts, three of the circuits have refused to apply any doctrine or concept of immunity to the charge of participation in illegal searches and seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.675" offset="11706075">This is too fundamental over a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.768" offset="11714435">It goes to the heart of the functioning of government itself within the framework of constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.644" offset="11745991">Now, I would suggest to the Court that as in Dombrowski-Pfister, before the Court two terms ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.553" offset="11797608">The issues here transcend the immediate question here presented as compelling as they are for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.245" offset="11852361">And as in Dombrowski-Pfister the problem is here posed as to whether this Court will say that under this system of ordered law, a remedy exists for the protection of fundamental liberties of the people and that this remedy will be available and that lawless activity of individuals regardless of their station in society are subject to the processes of the law and that the law stands ready to provide this relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.546" offset="12057579">I would suggest to the Court that within this concept, the judgment below should be reversed and these respondents should be required to stand trial on the charges presented in this complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="3047.694" offset="12294144">First, when we say that the petitioners claim from damages here is based on the allegation that the respondents joined with state authorities in a conspiracy to deprive the petitioners of their civil rights by means of unlawful arrest, search -- searches and seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.140" offset="12379930">This is the fundamental essential allegation of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.899" offset="12398947">We submit as we did in the District Court and that Court agreed with us that the uncontradicted proof adduced on the motion for summary judgment demonstrated beyond any doubt that the respondents had participated in no such conspiracy, and accordingly that there was no genuine issue of facts of trial, now, putting the matter differently that in the event of a trial that these respondents would have been entitled to a directed verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.783" offset="12542516">Now second, in our view the Court need not reach the issue of legislative immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.970" offset="12575222">However, if the Court deemed unnecessary to reach that issue, we submit that that doctrine in this case precludes liability what damages is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.072" offset="12635617">The only act charged against these respondents in connection with this alleged conspiracy is the issuance of the subpoenas and the transportation of the records to Washington pursuant to the subpoenas.</text>

            <text syncTime="3224.107" offset="12999764">I might say, at this point, I intended to say something about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.740" offset="13018363">Mr. Kinoy has relied upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.474" offset="13037275">And the ground of that decision was as I read it, that, and this is page 134 of the appen -- of the brief of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.645" offset="13077922">The ground of that decision was and Mr. Pfister made a statement to the press in which he announced that all the members of the committee had participated in this plan of raid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.249" offset="13128391">And the Court said and I quote, “If Pfister did make such statement the truth or falsity of the statement would bear on the accuracy of the committee members affidavits that they did not authorize the raids and in fact knew nothing of them before they would carry it out”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.698" offset="13198190">Now, in that case we have affidavits that our respondents didn't know anything about these raids and had nothing to do with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.224" offset="13228283">And there was no countervailing evidence whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.064" offset="13239672">So our case differs from the Pfister case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.430" offset="13253047">Now, at the outset, I might say also that it is not true, it is not a fact that our Court of Appeals held or found or concluded that there were a disputed issues of fact with respect to our client's participation in this conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.277" offset="13340505">All the Court said was they might have deal with that question but they did not reach it in view of their other view of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.416" offset="13381047">Now, in support of our motion for summary judgment, we found out affidavits from all of the alleged conspirators, all the people who had knowledge of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.816" offset="13430680">And the District Court also had before it on this motion, Mr. Sourwine's deposition which had been taken by the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.391" offset="13464952">The affidavits and the deposition on flatly and completely negated the allegation that the respondents had joined in this conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.135" offset="13511868">They demonstrated conclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.655" offset="13522004">But there was no such conservative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.564" offset="13533602">The leader Senator Eastland and Mr. Sourwine had anything or whatever to do with the arrest of Dombrowski or the searches and seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.126" offset="13579891">That prior to the date when the raids were made, October 4, both Senator Eastland and Mr. Sourwine understood and believe only that the state authorities might subpoena the records of SCEF and they were not told and did not know that action by way of arrest warrants was even contemplated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.993" offset="13671320">But I say this was established by the affidavits of all of the persons having knowledge of the fact -- facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.320" offset="13700681">Now, I might summarize the facts briefly because I think the statement by my friend, might perhaps be somewhat out of focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.169" offset="13740074">The fact shown by the record were the 1955, the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee investigated SCEF and probably to report on SCEF and his apparent or -- apparent organization which was called the Southern Conference on Human Welfare.</text>

            <label>Mr. Roger Robb</label>
            <text syncTime="3488.284" offset="14056469">Well, all I was saying is that this was in the report of the subcommittee which led Mr. Rogers when his committee began to investigate the same org -- same organization to get in touch with Mr. Sourwine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.464" offset="14113207">This is merely by way of showing why Mr. Rogers went to Sourwine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.531" offset="14141524">Now, in 1962, the state committee of Mr. Rogers, his committee, called this joint committee on Un-American Activities, started to investigate SCEF and knowing of the previous Senate investigation in 1954, in the Senate report, Rogers asked Mr. Sourwine for any information that he might properly give about SCEF.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.073" offset="14295646">And Sourwine did give Mr. Rogers certain information from the public records of his committee which was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.933" offset="14323127">At this time Mr. Rogers told Mr. Sourwine that his committee might possibly subpoena the records of SCEF and if he did so and he found anything that was of interest to Mr. Sourwine's committee that he would let Mr. Sourwine know, this I think is an orthodox exchange of information between committees and investigators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.346" offset="14416750">Now there was no discussion in that specific records, membership records or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.109" offset="14435767">This is categorically stated in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.438" offset="14449142">Later about the middle of September ‘63, Mr. Rogers telephoned to Mr. Sourwine and asked him, in the event that the state committee did subpoena the records of SCEF could Mr. Sourwine and Mr. Mendel who is an expert on the stuff of the committee, come down and help to evaluate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.753" offset="14542346">Mr. Sourwine took the matter up with Senator Eastland who told him that he and Mr. Mendel might go down if and only if it developed that the record subpoenaed related to matters within the scope of his committee's powers and jurisdiction and authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.607" offset="14617788">That is the Communist or the Communist front activities and the sound that the record shows emphasized that the subcommittee had no interest whatever in material having to do with civil rights or racial matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.728" offset="14678288">Now, nothing more on this matter at SCEF was heard from Mr. Rogers until October the 4th when he telephoned to Mr. Sourwine and told him the state committee had the SCEF material in his possession under subpoena and the material would be of great interest to Mr. Sourwine's committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.471" offset="14781210">Now the record shows that after his talk with Mr. Sourwine in September, mid-September, Mr. Rogers and his committee had concluded on the basis of their investigation that SCEF was in violation of the state statute, and therefore that they would proceed by way of arrest and search warrants rather than by way of subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.680" offset="14890088">Now, the record shows conclusive that neither Senator Eastland nor Mr. Sourwine knew anything of this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.210" offset="14928227">They weren't told about it, they weren't consulted about it and they had nothing more having to do with the resulting raids and arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.515" offset="14957484">There isn't a scintilla of evidence in the record to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.559" offset="14973576">In fact, Mr. Sourwine and Senator Eastland believed that at all times, prior to October 4, 1963, that if the state committee acquired the SCEF records, it would be done by way of subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.409" offset="15037001">And the first intermission they had to the contrary came in Mr. Rogers call on October 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.440" offset="15069184">Now, my friend referred to an affidavit which is printed as an appendix to his brief from a deputy counsel or investigator of the state committee in which he contend shows that this plan to seize the records by arrest warrants was made in August.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.139" offset="15155911">In the first place, that affidavit had dated over a year after the judgment in this case was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.508" offset="15177435">It does not apply in the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.181" offset="15188093">In the second place, I think if you look at the affidavit, you'll see that it does not -- it does not necessarily carry the implication which my friend contends that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.413" offset="15229053">All it says is that Mr. Rogers is going to talk to the state police and his own affidavit filed by us shows that he wasn't in touched with the state police and had examined their files prior to October.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.379" offset="15288926">Now, as I said, Mr. Rogers asked Mr. Sourwine and Mr. Mandel to come down and they did go down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.921" offset="15319019">The next day, October 5, they looked over the material, thought it was of interest to their committee and thought it came within the scope of their committee's authority and therefore Mr. Sourwine calls Senator Eastland, told him this and Senator Eastland authorized him to fill out and serve the subpoena or subpoenas on the state authorities calling upon them to produce these records in Washington, October 29.</text>

            <text syncTime="4792.919" offset="19275003">Their statement is in the record beginning at page 83 and recites in summary form the facts that I have mentioned here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.541" offset="19317530">Paragraph 43 of that statement recites that neither Senator Eastland nor Mr. Sourwine had anything whatsoever to do with the acquisition of the SCEF material by the joint committee or with the preparation, issuance or execution of the arrest and search warrants where under the joint committee obtained the material to SCEF.</text>

            <text syncTime="4948.823" offset="19898702">There had been a number of cases in the federal courts which we have cited in our brief on that point that one of the leading cases as taken by Judge Learned Hand which he said about what I've just said although in better language.</text>

            <text syncTime="5009.390" offset="20140910">As this Court stated in the great case of Kilbourn against Thompson, the purpose of the privilege conferred by the Speech and Debate Clause is to support the rights of the people or enabling their representatives to execute the functions of their office without fear of prosecutions, civil or criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5032.812" offset="20234637">Last time in the Johnson case, this Court said the privilege will be read broadly to effectuate its purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="5792.574" offset="23273618">Just on a factual question, the Court addressed the question as to whether the telegram to the senator was on the directions of the judge and the transcript on page 29 has a affidavit which says, “On instructions from Judge Ainsworth to notify the other parties to be present in his office at 9:00 AM on the morning of Monday, October 28, for the purpose of discussing the request for temporary restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5819.126" offset="23379884">Telegrams were sent to all of defendants, Green, Burbank and Willie.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5822.801" offset="23394617">That's in -- on page 29 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5826.590" offset="23409768">The telegram was sent at the instructions of Judge Ainsworth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5830.550" offset="23425546">That affidavit has never been controverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5833.412" offset="23437040">I just have one or two other remarks that I would like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="5838.453" offset="23457207">A suggestion has been made that perhaps in some way, the doctrines developed by this Court in Barr, the immunity doctrines, may save the respondents here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5850.235" offset="23504332">I would just like to point out that as was mentioned by the Court, the question in Barr was of course tort and liability on defamation.</text>

            <text syncTime="5880.129" offset="23623868">The opinion, the majority opinion in Barr is very clear that what the Court is there talking about are acts, normal ordinary business acts in the course of the conduct of the government business and I don't think the Court in the majority of dissent in Barr would have ever intimated that the participation in the illegal search and seizure would be the kind of activity which would invoke under any circumstances a man told of immunity under Barr and it's a matter of fact the --</text>

            <text syncTime="5922.782" offset="23794500">I think -- I -- in any event from their arguments, I think the respondents have been asserting that concept but even if Mr. Robb does concede that, I would say then clearly that the issue there is one of whether or not the acts here presents a contested issue of facts as to participation in the illegal searches and seizures or the fruits of the illegal searches and seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5952.329" offset="23912678">Now, in that respect, I don't think that the respondents here have responded -- have answered to the simple proposition brought forth by the Court in Kilbourn, because Kilbourn is quite clear that the use of the warrant of arrest by the sergeant was no protection in immunity to tort liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="5981.317" offset="24028662">I think the analogy is very clear here for the warrant of arrest and to the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="5985.963" offset="24047261">Now, finally, I would suggest that at least as I listened to the argument of Mr. Robb, there would seem to be no direct reputation of the simple record fact that the respondents here at a minimum engaged in activity taking the records out of the jurisdiction of Louisiana knowing that these were the fruits of an illegal search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="6021.886" offset="24190934">The record is perfectly clear about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6023.393" offset="24196995">The Louisiana Court has so ruled in which it is perfectly obvious that they were illegally seized fruits of a search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="6032.449" offset="24233148">I would suggest on two scores, one, that it's black letter conspiracy law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6038.062" offset="24255613">That fact showing the participation in the fruits of the conspiracy are certainly admissible to show the co-conspirators' knowledge of the conspiracy and the participation in the conspiracy and the second, this black letter law in respect to the laws of the Fourth Amendments, that the participation in the fruits of the illegal search and seizures are unconstitutionally void as the seizure itself.</text>
