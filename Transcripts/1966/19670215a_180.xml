            <label>Mr. Norman Dorsen</label>
            <text syncTime="86.957" offset="451166">Appellant, Mr. See was convicted under 8.01.140 which appears at page 11 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.466" offset="493275">It says, “Anyone violating or failing to comply with any provision of this Title or a lawful order of the Fire Chief shall upon conviction thereof be punishable by a fine not to exceed $300 or imprisonment in the City Jail for a period not to exceed 90 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment, and each day of violation shall con -- constitute a separate offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.644" offset="597974">In the light of the case you heard this morning and the light of Frank v. Maryland and Eaton v. Price, it is apparent that this ordinance is in a sense the ultimate weapon of municipalities because unlike the ordinance in Frank v. Maryland, this ordinance does not have any of the finely tailored provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.218" offset="668296">It does not have a provision providing that the inspector must have reasonable cause to find the nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.853" offset="690761">It doesn't even provide that the inspection take place at reasonable times and each of the four other ordinances before this Court have such a provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.674" offset="726079">The Eaton ordinance, the Frank ordinance, the Camara ordinance and the ordinance in Hadley v. City of Malden of Massachusetts which was filed in January and it's on the miscellaneous docket.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.620" offset="773831">Not only that, that this ordinance says nothing about credentials.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.593" offset="785742">In other words, this is an ordinance which is completely open-ended as far as the power of inspection is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.255" offset="816358">Now, the facts in this case are stipulated, they were stipulated from the start and they appear on pages 1 and 2 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.732" offset="850317">Mr. See, the appellant, is the owner of a private warehouse in the City of Seattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.280" offset="872469">The Fire Department, to its authorized representative demanded the defendant that an inspection be allowed as to the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.080" offset="907682">The Fire Department did not procure a search warrant and it made no claim that the Fire Department had any reasonable cause to believe a violation of the ordinance existed at the time of the demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.864" offset="958777">The appellant refused to admit the inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.282" offset="976541">Eventually a warrant was issued for his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.149" offset="987930">He was convicted in the Municipal Court, fined a $100 and a suspended fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.903" offset="1011022">He posted his bond, he appealed to the Superior Court of Washington which affirmed, and he then appealed to the Supreme Court of Washington which affirmed in an opinion which is cont -- which begins on page 17 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.745" offset="1058356">The constitutional issues before the Court were raised seasonably below and were passed on by the Supreme Court of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.384" offset="1088867">The basic position of the appellant in this is case is that Frank v. Maryland should be overruled, that a warrant should be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.214" offset="1116244">Alternatively, if Frank v. Maryland is not overruled, it is urged that the Court reverse this conviction, it reversed the decision below anyway because of the breadth of the ordinance and because of the failure to include the requirements of probable cause, a requirement which was contained in the ordinance of Baltimore, Maryland and Frank in the Frank case now which was stressed by both Justices Frankfurter and Whittaker in their two opinions with the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.028" offset="1219480">As far as overruling Frank v. Maryland, the basic position is that there must be some protection to the citizens against the man knocking on the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.275" offset="1256469">There must be some responsible way of determining the validity of the request for entry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1270.770" offset="5186435">The construction and maintenance of certain buildings, the equipment that must be put into plants and warehouses and apartment houses, and what we refer to as highlight for occupancies, all in connection with fire prevention activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.817" offset="5254666">The ordinance as a whole is directed towards flammable and explosive materials and liquids.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.469" offset="5285282">The method of obtaining compliance with this ordinance is one that's been in existence in the cities since about 1884 in one form or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.773" offset="5322480">Today, it involves a fire inspection program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.624" offset="5337840">Virtually every member of the Seattle Fire Department, it is involved in this inspection program and it goes on during the non-winter months of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.880" offset="5366888">The object of the ordinance is remedial and not punitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.165" offset="5380054">We are not attempting here to -- or our object here is not to put people in jail or to put fines on our citizens but to attempt to cure a defect, or error of omission if you please before the fire actually occurs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2768.879" offset="11178924">In a sense, I was delighted with the first case because it's either no inspections on a routine basis or an inspection only on the same showing with a probable cause according to the appellant and a probable legal cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.617" offset="11241827">Appellant here is a bit more reasonable in saying, “Well a spot check or a -- a routine inspection program.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.966" offset="11279235">My suggestion here is that the routine inspection program can be put into a mimeographed warrant, a mimeographed justification and I can leave blank in that mimeograph the number of the house and possibly the name of the person although I don't see why I need it, because this isn't a personal process and a blank for signatures.</text>
