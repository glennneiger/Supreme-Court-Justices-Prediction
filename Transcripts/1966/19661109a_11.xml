            <label>Mr. Leonard S. Goodman</label>
            <text syncTime="12.762" offset="154415">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.444" offset="169148">The Commission has suggested in its amicus brief that the statute grants it a jurisdiction of a foreign commerce engaged in by railroads subject to a proviso which limits this jurisdiction personally, to carriers American or foreign which performs some transportation within the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.870" offset="238843">Now, we left off yesterday with considering this Court's opinion in the Porter case, decided in 1961, where the Commission compared the entire three rates from Canada to the United States, found discrimination in the entire rate and ordered the carriers performing transportation in the United States to end the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.604" offset="321808">The Canadian national was exempted from that decision for example since that that Commission stated, “No transportation within the United States was performed by that carrier.”</text>
            <text syncTime="66.789" offset="370500">This Court sustained the jurisdiction of the Commission on the grounds it was enough that the order ran against the American carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.001" offset="399339">Here, the Commission likewise considers the entire rate applicable in foreign commerce and limits its order to run only insofar as the transportation takes place in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.117" offset="439881">If the case had involved future rates, rather than only past rates, the Commission would not have prescribed a rate for application within Canada but again would have entered an order requiring American carriers to seize participation in unlawful rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.913" offset="499022">In all events, orders entered by the Commission in its supervision of foreign commerce engaged in by railroads are so drawn as to effect directly only the transportation occurring in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.456" offset="545207">We submit that this is a rational interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.380" offset="556910">One consistently adopted for 56 years an interpretation that is worth well in practice and one that should not be disturbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.539" offset="589511">Mr. Justice Fortas asked Mr. Myers yesterday, but isn't the Commission requiring American carriers to pay the shipper more than the carrier received as an overpayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.341" offset="632769">Our answer is an equivocal yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.404" offset="644995">The division of the rate agreed upon by the carriers is of no concern to the shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.856" offset="662758">He is entitled to full damages from anyone of the carriers participating in the agreed upon joint rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.554" offset="685537">In the Porter case, the Commission required American carriers to police the international rates for discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.226" offset="708315">Here, it requires them to police past rates for unjustness and unreasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.645" offset="725974">Rather than place the burden on the shipper, to bring two suits to recover his damage, in this case, a Canadian suit would involve less than $1,400.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.011" offset="767457">The Commission allows one suit and is held for 56 years that if the American carriers entitled to contribution, it should work that out with its Canadian counterpart.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.644" offset="801938">We find no recorded cases over contribution in this half century of experience under the Commission's interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.693" offset="834121">Now, Mr. Justice Black asked whether the Commission disregard Canadian law and Mr. Justice Fortas also asked as I recall what part would the ICC determination play in Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.600" offset="881768">Well, we have just cited and discussed on brief the early Stoy cases which held that the Canadian Commission if suit were brought there in the first instance would approach the case exactly as the Commission has done and determine the lawfulness of the entire rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.806" offset="946552">Canada would not go bound by the ICC determination and we are not bound by their determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.815" offset="970585">In our view, the statute grants the Commission a concurrent jurisdiction over foreign commerce and the Commission may grant relief to shippers injured by railroads engaged in foreign commerce so long as they perform some transportation in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.143" offset="1027950">The act the Commission administers is of course a product of much history.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.801" offset="1046549">The original Act of 1887 did not contain the proviso to the Commission's jurisdiction along which the Solicitor General relies.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.116" offset="1079881">In the Black Horse Tobacco case of 1910, the entire Commission explained that it had jurisdiction over foreign commerce, one, to issue a seize and desist order to require American carriers to stop applying an unlawful joint rate on traffic into Mexico; and two, to order reparation be paid on the entire through rate since the American carriers were jointly and severally responsible for all unlawfulness in such rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.421" offset="1189073">During the hearings on the Transportation Act of 1920 which involved a complete rewriting and reorganization of the Act, this position was explained to Congress and in adding the proviso to Section 1, the report of the House Committee states it was adding and I quote, “minor corrections in clarifying the language in several respects but makes no important change in policy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="297.734" offset="1294294">The Commission continued in the International Nickel Company case of 1922 to require that reparation be paid on the entire international joint rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="349.148" offset="1499930">I believe it was in the Transportation Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.131" offset="1507871">My memory is very vague on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.731" offset="1522291">It might have been in the Transportation Act of 1920 where some comment was made that an informal agreement had been tried to be reached between the governments concerning a division of responsibility on these rates and no agreement could be reached whether this meant that there had been some dispute between the governments, I could not tell from that and certainly this comment did not go very far.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.675" offset="1654053">No legislation was introduced.</text>

            <text syncTime="389.599" offset="1661785">What happens in a case like that in a practical manner when you charge the whole over charge against the American carrier as a practical manner, does the Canadian carrier makes some kind of an adjustment on the division?</text>

            <text syncTime="464.422" offset="1961044">It was Mr. Chief Justice's practice of Commissioner's report to Congress as late as 1962 and I've cited in our brief the next draft from hearings held in 1962 in which we explained to Congress what we were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.441" offset="2029171">Finally, the Solicitor General invokes considerations of committee, equity and practicality.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.282" offset="2056547">They too we believe support the jurisdiction exercise consistently by the Commission since 1910.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.025" offset="2083506">We might suggest under the heading of committee that first Canada recognizes the Commission's jurisdiction and exercises a concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.222" offset="2120286">And there's not a shred of evidence that our good relations are effective in any way with Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.151" offset="2139930">Under the heading of equity, we would submit that the Solicitor General's approach would require the shippers to bring separate suits in the United States and Canada on often very small claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.277" offset="2180472">And under the heading of practicality, as I recall yesterday, Solicitor General stated to this Court that the Commission's interpretation has not created very upsetting problems in response to the question of the Chief Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="554.071" offset="2319653">On the other hand, the Solicitor General's solution would raise a host of practical problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.638" offset="2341909">Now, we address ourselves on brief to the weaknesses of using divisions as a standard for measuring the shipper's damage resulting from an unlawful rate.</text>
