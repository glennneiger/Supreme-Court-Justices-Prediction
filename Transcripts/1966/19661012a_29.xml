            <label>Mr. Jacob Kossman</label>
            <text syncTime="22.238" offset="192345">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.612" offset="213870">This case represents an object lesson and how law enforcement should not be carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.718" offset="246262">It involves the use of a concealed tape recorder, it involves entrapment, it involves a decoy but most disturbing of all and perhaps the most disturbing feature of almost any case that I can recall is the use by federal prosecutors of two federal district judges to investigate and to convict a petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.592" offset="381785">We can live with the concealed recording machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.620" offset="397876">We can live with entrapments.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.235" offset="408325">We can live with decoys.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.907" offset="418983">But our nation, as we know it, cannot exist when federal district judges associate themselves in the investigative stage and at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.574" offset="469661">Now I think I can best assist this Court in first concentrating on the essential facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.255" offset="500381">And petitioner was indicted with three counts of obstructing justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.134" offset="523891">The second count, he was acquitted; the third count, the Government dropped before the trial; the first count and the one he was convicted reads as follows, “That he did corruptly endeavor to affect, obstruct.”</text>
            <text syncTime="121.505" offset="589406">The next read as follows -- in effect be -- just follows and skip a little language and impede that do administration of justice in that he did request counsel and direct Robert D. Vick, the contact, Ralf A. Elliott, Vick's cousin, a member of a jury panel and to offer and to promise to pay Elliott $10,000 to induce -- to set Elliott to vote for an acquittal if he should be selected to sit on the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.511" offset="709465">Who is this man Vick that Osborn talked to?</text>
            <text syncTime="158.889" offset="738931">Vick was an investigator for Osborn back in 1962 when they were investigating a jury panel in order to determine race, religion, occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.534" offset="805491">Vick also was a member of the Police Department, on the Sheriffs Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.780" offset="822523">Vick also did private investigations, divorce cases and what not.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.267" offset="848436">But Vick in this case was, although the Government denies it, was working for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.044" offset="911548">When I say they deny it, they say he was no agent of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.540" offset="933491">They displayed an attempt to repudiate Vick even though they've gotten the benefits of his work, I don't think speaks well and I left the record conclusively prove that he was an agent of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.585" offset="1001723">In fact he said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.327" offset="1012694">Now, back to Vick, in June of 1963 --</text>

            <text syncTime="267.459" offset="1173191">He was a city policemen that wouldn't be -- and of course Osborn didn't know the second time around that he was working for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.653" offset="1206000">The first time around, he was simply a policeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.524" offset="1221465">But there's a part time, let's call it moonlighting, that policeman or deputy sheriff can make this ordinary investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.047" offset="1267545">Actually, he was one of the group of four or five or six investigators.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.019" offset="1355421">And there was no idle gesture.</text>

            <text syncTime="420.901" offset="1786964">In June of 1963, Vick reported to the F.B.I. that he -- this is very important than working all of the previous week for petitioner were now in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.330" offset="1860733">Mr. Osborn, the petitioner's client and others had been indicted in May of 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.833" offset="1890722">Vick reported to the FBI that he had been working for all of the previous week for petitioner and indicated to them that he wished to cooperate with the Government and make any information available that he had.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.828" offset="1954670">Now, he was told, in all fairness, that since he works for an attorney, who was representing the defendant who had been indicted, they would not avail themselves of the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.404" offset="2016946">Vick then called Mr. Sheridan, who was a special consultant to the Department of Justice, a non-lawyer and I understand that that job is no longer in existence, and asked him for an appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.063" offset="2087581">Sheridan met him at the very courthouse that the petitioner was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.786" offset="2114539">And Vick, at the trial, was asked this question, “You were afraid you would lose your job?”</text>

            <text syncTime="708.314" offset="2936665">In August and September of 1963, Vick had several conversations with Sheridan, who is I think with the Department of Justice, special consultant and in charge of certain investigations in Nashville.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.578" offset="3001657">But to place these -- those conversations, narrate in a shorthand way, Vick said that he wanted to clean (Inaudible), that he wanted a -- that he was going to work for Osborn, and that he wanted to turnover any information that he could to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.762" offset="3078457">Sheridan agreed with these limitations saying that he wanted reports only on illegal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.111" offset="3111790">And Sheridan's own words, Sheridan says, “If you become aware of any illegal activities, I would like him, meaning Vick, to represent me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="764.670" offset="3162049">Now the plot thickens, we're now in September 1963, the middle of September 1963 two months before the charges -- indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.640" offset="3205935">In September of 1963, while Vick was not working for Osborn, Vick approached another Nashville lawyer, a Mr. Wallace, with the jury list.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.660" offset="3266017">The jury list came out in the middle of June for the approaching case involving Osborn's client.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.243" offset="3296319">And he said to this lawyer Wallace that he had a cousin on the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.675" offset="3318053">And asled whether this juror held out for an acquittal, would it be worth $50,000 to Osborn's client.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.976" offset="3351280">Wallace refused to have anything to do with it but about two months later, after Osborn has been disbarred in consequences of the matter stated in indictment, Vick told Wallace that his assignment had been to get the petitioner and Wallace but that he had only gotten the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.800" offset="3446575">But, we're now in the middle of September but as Vick admitted and that's on 223A and 259A and 260, petitioner had not reemployed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.304" offset="3496626">Again, he went repeatedly to Osborn and begged him and finally, he succeeded in being reemployed by Osborn on October the 28th of 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.534" offset="3569560">Now, October the 28th, 1963 his agreement had been with Sheridan that he would only report illegal activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="905.061" offset="3723577">Vick was given the last pages of the jury list in Judge Miller's courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.445" offset="3749177">Now this case was listed for Judge Gray.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.657" offset="3757955">There are two district judges in the Middle District of Nashville, Tennessee, Judge Miller and Judge Gray.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.422" offset="3789093">Vick was given the last pages of the jury list in Judge Miller's courtroom because the case was not assigned to Judge Miller; it was assigned to Judge Gray, he gave them the bottom -- paid the jurors there.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.114" offset="3843845">True, there was a possibility of all the jurors that have been exhausted and Judge Gray, they might have called someone from Judge Miller's jury list.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.750" offset="3878327">But, that was the condition that Mr. Vick was hired and that becomes very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.938" offset="3907166">As I say, Vick immediately repaid this kindness of Osborn by immediately calling up Sheridan and told him he was hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.087" offset="3935692">Now comes a stronger point.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.934" offset="3943111">In fact, it's so strong that the prosecution studiously avoids mentioning it in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.572" offset="3965680">One week before Vick was employed -- we're now back on October the 21st.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.051" offset="3983548">I'm sorry that I can't give it in a chronological order but that's the way the record shapes up, one week before Vick was employed on October 21st, he had a meeting with Sheridan in Nashville.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.502" offset="4049377">What took place at that meeting?</text>
            <text syncTime="988.281" offset="4056482">We know thus much about the meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.943" offset="4067140">Vick told Sheridan, Government man, the special consultant to the attorney general, that he had a cousin Elliott on the jury list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.593" offset="4109772">Not Judge Miller's list but on Judge Gray's list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.874" offset="4122833">Now, this is very important not only because he had the discussion with Sheridan, certainly no illegal activity, that all that Sheridan said he wanted to hear, but because Vick thought it was so important because he testified falsely about it during the motion to suppress and at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.250" offset="4212381">He was asked, “Did you ever mention to the Government, to Sheridan, to anyone that Vick -- they're talking to Vick -- that you had a cousin on the jury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.539" offset="4269537">He said, “No, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.469" offset="4277269">Question: “No living human being?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.369" offset="4284897">“No, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.364" offset="4288867">130A, 131A, 343A.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.961" offset="4307257">At the actual trial, he was asked these questions surprisingly on redirect examination by the prosecutor: “Mr. Vick, I want to ask you just a very few questions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.557" offset="4345605">That time of -- well, I don't take the time to read it, but he denied, since I never mentioned Elliott discussing on the jury to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.288" offset="4384475">And here of course, as the records shows completely, 348A, 349A, because Sheridan put in the Vick's report that he had a discussion with Vick and Vick on October the 21st, one week before he went to work for Osborn, told Sheridan of his cousin who was on the jury as well as discussing other members on the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.001" offset="4483427">Now, Vick testified that the first time and of course the rule of the jury's verdict we accept that, the first time that he mentioned Elliott, his cousin, to Osborn, was on November the 7th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.788" offset="4558555">Petition arose to the bay and told Vick, to see Elliott and get him on our side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.287" offset="4584469">Vick said he would see Elliott.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.342" offset="4592724">In fact, he did not and as he testified at the trial the whole thing was a pretense, never had any intention of doing it and he admittedly reported this conversation of November the 7th to Sheridan, called him in Washington collect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1212.569" offset="4953631">Judge Miller testified when this matter came to his attention, November 8th in the form of an affidavit by a person that he never knew, he's decided the best course to take was to allow a tape recorder to be used which will either clear this man or prove he was guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.894" offset="5026983">That was the testimony on rebuttal testimony at the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1242.911" offset="5075048">Vick then have more conversations with petitioner concerning Elliott acting under the directions from Sheridan who told them play this matter by year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.150" offset="5116008">On November the 11th the recording was finally made and the transcript of that recording was immediately shown to the judges who had authorized the carrying of the recorder.</text>

            <text syncTime="2595.485" offset="10485321">The pro -- this -- Osborn didn't hire Vick in order to fix a juror.</text>

            <text syncTime="2607.158" offset="10532028">He says so, Vick, “I had never intended to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.638" offset="10549896">I only wanted to find out his intentions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.245" offset="10560345">You can't go and set up people by finding out their intentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.061" offset="10583646">Well, to come back now was this entrapment business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.027" offset="10619486">It was Vick who was the first one who subtly put very subtle the idea of approaching Elliott in the petitioner's mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.712" offset="10658252">Not petitioner who originated the idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.611" offset="10669850">It was the same idea that Vick had on successfully looked to peddle to Mr. Wallace back in September to another investigator, Polk when he had mentioned to them and they were -- said to Osborn, “I'm surprised they never told it to you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.086" offset="10739754">It's on the same idea that Vick undoubtedly had when they talked to Sheridan on October the 21st.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.564" offset="10761592">Why he didn't call up Sheridan and said -- and say, “I was hired” if there wasn't a plan?</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.112" offset="10779773">The most telling features of the plan are padlocked and to entrap the petitioner of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.137" offset="10799940">First, he -- until confronted with the and too confronted with the Jencks Act document, Sheridan's report, Vick twice denied he ever mentioned Elliott to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.920" offset="10831078">That was the real secret prior to mentioning Elliott to Osborn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.310" offset="10848632">Sheridan said of his understanding with Vick, an understanding that was reached well and advanced of his employment, “I want you to represent me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.755" offset="10890428">Third, if the Vick with the hard locked story have succeeded in getting reemployed by petitioner and had advised Sheridan of the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.643" offset="10921984">Sheridan said, “Don't forget, just play it by ear and continue discussions with Osborn and report it to me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.334" offset="10952704">Fourth, Vick admitted, “I was trying to find out what Mr. Osborn's intentions were and prove it make a case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.575" offset="10985723">Fifth, if the petitioner had been disbarred, Vick boasted to Wallace that his assignment was to get Tommy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.698" offset="11018115">Now, we submit that of November 11th conversation that was recorded by Wick -- Vick, which was sent out at length cannot be considered an isolation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.689" offset="11050088">It's a terrible thing in isolation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.634" offset="11057925">It's a terrible thing taken in context but in the light of the foregoing facts, we say we come under the Sherman case when petitioner said to Vick the words on which this entire proceeding was premised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.523" offset="11105468">They were the product of the creative activity of law enforcement officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.013" offset="11123440">We haven't -- that's why I say we have a case of entrapment here as a matter of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3894.129" offset="15679927">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3897.870" offset="15694869">This case concerns the conviction of petitioner, a member of the Tennessee Bar since 1940 on count 1 of an indictment alleging violations of the General Obstruction of Justice statute, 18 U.S.C. 1503.</text>
            <text syncTime="3912.869" offset="15754846">In the count on which he was convicted, petitioner was charged with having requested and directed one Robert Vick, a Nashville Police officer, who he had retained to investigate prospective jurors to offer a $10,000 bribe to a cousin of Vick's, who was a potential juror in a trial on which petitioner was scheduled to represent one of then five defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.211" offset="15860172">The charges on which the defendants were being tried involved four other endeavors, corruptly who approached jurors in an earlier criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.476" offset="15897266">And those charges resulted in the convictions of five defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.610" offset="15917850">Four of whom are before the court in the case immediately -- to be argued immediately following this one and on the fifth of which, the case on the fifth that which this Court denied certiorari last term and denied with a petition for rehearing just this past Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.298" offset="15980544">The Government's evidence at petitioner's trial consisted essentially of the testimony of Vick, the police officer; corroboration of that testimony in the form of a tape recording of the last of three conversations between petitioner and Vick on that subject and third, petitioner's admissions, partly false exculpatory statements which he made in the course of the disbarment proceedings which were conducted in the Federal District Court in Nashville very shortly after the events at issue here.</text>

            <text syncTime="4007.590" offset="16133726">If -- this has been referred to as disbarment proceedings, they were proceedings is to bar him from practicing in the Federal District Court?</text>

            <text syncTime="4015.186" offset="16164133">Only in a Federal District Court, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.369" offset="16172805">Proceedings in the state, to disbar him in the -- from practice in the state court have -- are still pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.986" offset="16199346">And, I imagine, really being held in abeyance pending the argument in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.557" offset="16225573">Petitioner's sole defense at his trial was entrapment based largely on the claim that the entire course of conduct was part of a Government plot intended to disqualify him from representing James Hoffa in the forthcoming trial on obstruction of justice charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.571" offset="16305612">That issue of entrapment was submitted to the jury under instructions to which petitioner did not object at his trial and to which he has interposed only the most technical and minor challenges which we rebut in our brief in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4067.605" offset="16373844">Since the entrapment question was the major focus of trial and since petitioner's other major contentions are related in some way to the cases that immediately followed this one, it will be more exhaustively discussed in certain ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.318" offset="16436642">In those cases, I would like with the court's permission to direct my argument, first to the entrapment issue and then in turn to the Fourth Amendment claims relating to the recording and insofar as the issues in succeeding cases here involved to those issues as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="4099.256" offset="16500381">And I would leave for conclusion for such time which has left petitioner's final contention which is not at all discussed in Mr. Kossman's oral argument that there was no obstruction of -- no violation of the statute here because the attempt was “factually impossible.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.654" offset="16578017">The principle contention relative to entrapment is that the evidence established that defense so conclusively that the issue should not even have been submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4128.734" offset="16618350">Now there are, of course, instances in which this Court has held, particularly in Sherman versus United States in 356 U.S. that that course is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.877" offset="16662862">This case, both on the testimony of Vick and we submit even on the testimony of petitioner as to what happened between Vick and himself is not one of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4151.353" offset="16708733">The facts are not really complex but before even turning to those, I think it's important to dispose of a basic misapprehension which runs through petitioner's brief and through the oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.233" offset="16760351">One of the much debated issues at trial or at least debated to some extent was whether Vick was an agent of the Government in November whether he was an undercover informant as of that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4175.407" offset="16804968">And petitioner's counsel attempted on various occasions to get Vick to admit that he was an agent of the Federal Government when he was speaking with petitioner or indeed when he accepted employment from petitioner in October of 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.624" offset="16865886">Now, the extent of Vick's agency in that respect, whether he had been deputized by the Federal Government was certainly an element to be considered by the jury in determining whether there was any substance to petitioner's claim that this was part of large plot by the Government to entrapment into making statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4208.384" offset="16936939">But we submit that on -- the issue now before the court as to whether there was entrapment as a matter of law, that question is really not seriously involved because even if the jury had concluded on the testimony that Vick had been deputized by the Federal Government or had been told to speak to Osborn, the petitioner in this case, the defense of entrapment would not be made out because the conversations between petitioner and Vick were such that -- under Vick's version, they couldn't know if it amount to entrapment and under petitioners they would at most amount even if made directly to a paid agent of the Government who isn't in the employ of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4255.166" offset="17124080">They would at most amount to an issue that would be submitted to the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="4346.254" offset="17488436">And I think that's really what the court meant that lawful entrapment would amount to a trap for the unwary criminal.</text>

            <text syncTime="4378.021" offset="17615496">Well, I never heard of it before either Mr. Justice Stewart but I think from the whole context of the instruction its quite clear that the court was really intending to warn the jury that it need not acquit the defendant merely because he fell into a Government trap.</text>
            <text syncTime="4395.197" offset="17684146">The Government may use a trap.</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.005" offset="17691355">And that's -- and possibly the use of the word “entrapment” might otherwise under the standard instruction in some way confuse the jury into the believing that if there was any trap laid then the defendant must be acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4411.302" offset="17748616">On -- just on the question of Vick's agency vis-à-vis, the Federal Government, and to clear up some matters that were raised during petitioners argument, I think I should make clear that there were some discussions in answer to the Chief Justice's question as to whether Vick was drawing his salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4429.725" offset="17822281">Of course at the time of the incidence in question in this case, at the time that he was speaking to petitioner, and been hired by petitioner to do investigative work, he was in no way drawing any salary from the Federal Government nor has he ever drawn any salary from the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4447.006" offset="17891349">The testimony which Mr. Kossman referred was testimony relating to what Vick was doing at the time of petitioner's trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="4671.621" offset="18789857">In other words, the dozens or scores of entrapment cases all involve government employees who engaged in undercover capacity, who speak to a defendant and the question is whether they induced the defendant to commit the crime or whether the defendant himself was disposed so to do and all that the entrapper did was provide him with the opportunity to perform and commit that particular crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="4700.190" offset="18904168">And that we submit is what the central issue is before this Court at this juncture whether in his conduct with petitioner, Vick induced somebody who was willing to perform the crime and looking for an approach to a juror to perform it or whether he under the -- oh, under the evidence that were submitted to the jury or under all the evidence in the case was inducing the commission of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="4732.623" offset="19033840">We think that Vick's testimony makes it entirely clear and Vick's testimony certainly could be believed by the jury and under this Court decision in the Masciale case in 356 U.S., the jury was free to believe Vick's testimony and Vick's testimony was that it required nothing more to get petitioner to suggest to him an approach to a juror than the mere statement on November the 7th of 1963, “I have a cousin on the jury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.173" offset="19152018">And that statement was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="4764.085" offset="19159751">And it caused petitioner to go out into the alley with him or out on the alley near his office with him to suggest to him that he approach that juror.</text>
