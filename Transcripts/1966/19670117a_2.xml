            <text syncTime="551.079" offset="2307636">The dilemma of the bookmaker is apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.671" offset="2322056">If he registers and pays the wagering taxes, he is generating evidence of his gambling activities, evidence that is available to local authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.661" offset="2373987">If he does not register, he exposes himself to the sanctions and penalties and contained in the federal wagering tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.411" offset="2417037">As Mr. Justice Black pointed out in the dissent in the Lewis case over 10 years ago, if this scheme does not violate the privilege, it's very difficult to think of any thing that would violate the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.478" offset="2485269">But for these two decisions of Kahriger and Lewis, it seems clear that the Fifth Amendment violation here is obvious on the phase both in terms of incriminating a potential taxpayer under federal law and under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.493" offset="2561337">I think the central question then for the Court is, what then is the basis for Kahriger and Lewis which justified the result reached there?</text>
            <text syncTime="630.192" offset="2624136">Those two decisions really stand on two pegs.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.904" offset="2638973">The first is hardly at issue anymore for reasons that I will explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.859" offset="2662797">It was the notion suggested in both of the Kahriger and Lewis dates -- cases that since the petitioner had not purchased the tax stamp he couldn't rely on the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.861" offset="2710862">I think this Court's decision in Albertson last term fairly clearly set that to rest then I should point out that the Government in its brief does not even claim to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.102" offset="2763734">So the real issue in the case is, what is the foundation that has continuing merit in Kahriger and Lewis if any?</text>
            <text syncTime="673.812" offset="2798634">The Court said in Kahriger and Lewis, that the wagering tax law is prospective and only -- and one need not go ahead and gamble.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.478" offset="2849311">Therefore, there is nothing compulsory.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.684" offset="2866134">And I think if there is an examination in detail of this concept, and I point out that in both Kahriger and Lewis there were many other issues beside Fifth Amendment issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.445" offset="2909184">And the Fifth Amendment discussion in these cases was very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.913" offset="2931022">What then is the basis for this notion of prospective application?</text>
            <text syncTime="711.335" offset="2948681">And how does it really apply?</text>
            <text syncTime="715.290" offset="2964564">I urge the Court's attention to Form 11-C which is in the record as already pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.027" offset="2995493">The questions asked, and I'm speaking now the form as it existed at the time involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.445" offset="3033109">Are you engaged -- among other questions, are you engaged in the business of accepting wagers on your own account?</text>
            <text syncTime="740.710" offset="3066232">That's one question, another is, "Do you receive wagers for or on behalf of some other person or persons?"</text>
            <text syncTime="752.296" offset="3112521">It seems to me that it's extremely difficult to say, that answering those questions as framed in applying regular concepts of interpretation means that there's any thing in the future about those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.526" offset="3177514">Because the question is specifically in the past tense, “Are you engaged in the business?”, and “Do you receive wagers?”</text>
            <text syncTime="777.522" offset="3213458">There's nothing prospective about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1300.884" offset="5306911">Yes Your Honor, within the concept of this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.462" offset="5325197">I think once he's had the intent to engage in the business of gambling, he must register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.096" offset="5351737">And therefore, he has no real choice to discontinue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.578" offset="5373680">There is a very excellent comment I think on that precise point Mr. Justice White which came out last Friday after I have written my brief, it's by Professor John Mansfield of the Harvard Law School and its in the new edition of the Supreme Court Review, and it states this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.246" offset="5448391">“In the opinion in the Lewis case, it is stated as relevant to the validity of the wagering tax registration requirement that the petitioner had no constitutional right to gamble.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.180" offset="5500113">Of course, he had no right to gamble.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.159" offset="5512025">That is to say he could be punished for the act of gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.330" offset="5528743">But the question is whether it is constitutionally permissible to impose upon the activity of gambling, punishment, not only for engaging in this activity but such further in particular burdens as arise from requiring disclosure of an intention to gamble”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.046" offset="5603558">That I think that -- the statement in Kahriger and the statement in Lewis or rather the statement in Lewis, that suggest that you can always avoid this dilemma by just abandoning your notion to gamble.</text>

            <text syncTime="1390.225" offset="5664266">Well, let's assume you could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.527" offset="5677432">Suppose the law had said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.203" offset="5688195">All you have to do is quit gambling and you don't have to register even if you've been a gambler before?</text>

            <text syncTime="1407.429" offset="5733125">But it seems to me that it could be used at any rate if their -- if you were required to register at all as a lead for past activities also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.285" offset="5776488">So that it's not completely -- it's not completely perspective.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jacob D. Zeldes</label>
            <text syncTime="1439.249" offset="5860394">I haven't yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.048" offset="5863528">But I -- I'm about come to that and then I think that -- that it clearly is a violation under Fifth Amendment, even if it is wholly prospective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.906" offset="5898951">But that its -- the argument for reversal here is not dependent upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.461" offset="5929253">I think that the supplemental form now called for a -- under the statutory scheme is clearly retrospective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.771" offset="5970422">For example, there is a requirement that 10 days after you have additional employees, you must relate their names to the commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.671" offset="6006053">In that situation then, it is absolutely a passed act that is being recorded and there can be no question about the applicability of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.808" offset="6062582">Perhaps one other face of the weakness in Kahriger and Lewis can be demonstrated by a reference to United States versus Calamaro in which this case decided that certain activities need not register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.679" offset="6130082">For example, a runner in the numbers business who did not have the requisite proprietary interest may not have had to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.065" offset="6167594">But if he were to be elevated in the gambling business and register and assuming that it only applied prospectively, then if Your Honor please, it could be used as a lead to engage to -- bring about a trial of the activities prohibited by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.466" offset="6233213">So it seems that there is really under a keen analysis of the Kahriger and Lewis cases, nothing that has withstood more recent decisions along this area of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.781" offset="6290474">The Government -- its position does restate the Kahriger and Lewis positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.318" offset="6312626">That I cannot deny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.155" offset="6320044">It does not however justify the underlying principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.286" offset="6340524">I think its well to point out that in Kahriger and in Lewis, there was no discussion whatsoever of the older principles which had been emphasized both before and after that if a information will lead to an investigation in the criminal prosecution, the Fifth Amendment for its protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.985" offset="6423280">That whole concept which is so important to this Court's thinking in recent cases, was not even discussed in Kahriger and Lewis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.670" offset="6458075">I think that the Albertson decision which was handed down last term when compared to the Kahriger decision and the Lewis decision, demonstrates the self-incriminatory nature of the things that would -- which we are here concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.317" offset="6564655">And this is so I believe, even if the comparison is made to the new form that the Government injected in this case at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.507" offset="6613452">Incidentally at the time that the Government opposed certiorari in this case, the new form was not been available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.635" offset="6649919">So I think the only form that it's really an issue in the case is the form that was annexed in the record and which is part of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.648" offset="6681997">But the -- assuming for a moment the applicability of the new form which is annexed to the Government's brief and comparing it to the form which this Court appended to its opinion in Albertson, it just seems like here as there, they used the words “the Court”, the self-incriminatory nature of the inquiry is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.392" offset="6764962">The first question involves the name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.077" offset="6779695">The first question in the other -- in the tax form in -- asked for the name and also asked for the aliases, much as the form in the communist registration provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.270" offset="6840404">The Form 5 which is one of the key bits of information that the Government wrote -- 6 in Form 11-C, specifically ask for the number of employees or agents engaged in receiving wagers on your behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.803" offset="6914591">There is therefore, nothing prospective their.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.300" offset="6928593">So comparing these two forms together if Your Honor please, it seems clear that Kahriger and Lewis cannot withstand the test of the Albertson decision.</text>
