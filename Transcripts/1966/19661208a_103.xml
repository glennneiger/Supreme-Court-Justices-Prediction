            <text syncTime="36.000" offset="247411">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.688" offset="262144">This case is here because of a vital piece of grocery bag that was unconstitutionally seized from the defendant and unconstitutionally used against him at his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.655" offset="310000">It presents the issues whether if it is ever only harmless to violate the United States Constitution and whether in fact it was harmless here.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.072" offset="347617">Defendant Cooper was prosecuted and convicted for selling two bindles of heroine wrapped in a piece of brown paper bag to a police informer who is both unreliable and untrustworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.560" offset="397563">At the trial, the prosecution placed this unconstitutionally seized piece of brown paper in the same exhibit as the two bindles of heroine and the other piece of brown paper within which they have been wrapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.749" offset="450330">He presented it before to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.086" offset="459734">The piece of paper was obtained after the police had set up this controlled narcotic buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.965" offset="483244">And on the appeal of this case, the Attorney General of the State of California argued to the District Court of Appeals that this unconstitutional evidence was highly relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.344" offset="528697">Petitioner was hurt in the trial court by the use of this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.629" offset="545938">He was hurt also in the appellate court by the notion that violation of the constitution can be dismissed as harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.245" offset="580315">I think a fair premise from which to start in this case is that prosecutors act rationally.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.075" offset="611662">The -- when they bring a prosecution against a man, they don't bring it if they believe he's innocent, they bring it because they believe he's guilty and that he'd be -- and that he deserves a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.705" offset="654190">And in introducing the evidence in that case, they've act on the assumption that that evidence will hurt him.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.258" offset="680417">There would be no reason for a prosecutor to bring in evidence in a case unless he felt that it would contribute to the conviction of a man that he assumed to be guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.839" offset="726706">Why should an appellate court speculate that this decision of the prosecutor was harmless when the man's constitutional rights were violated not only by the seizure of the evidence but by the use of that evidence at trial.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Traynor</label>
            <text syncTime="227.795" offset="1014575">This Court -- the petitioner here relies on the rule of the coerced confession cases and the many other cases that this Court has decided in which the violation of the constitution has not been considered harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.937" offset="1075075">For thirty years since Brown against Mississippi, this Court and the federal court in habeas court proceedings with judiciary records of the state courts and convictions obtained on the basis of coerced confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.064" offset="1119587">Here and in Miranda, this approach is totality of circumstances approach was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.055" offset="1151561">The approach that the respondent asks this Court to take here would impose an even more unmanageable burden upon the federal courts and this Court on reviewing the facts in the records in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.258" offset="1204433">As the Attorney General of the State of California argued in the other case, what this rule requires is an examination of the entire record and the entire case and the evidence in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.688" offset="1254170">In the coerced confession cases, the issue and the burden of review was limited to the very small issue whether the confession obtained was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.444" offset="1289174">Here, the burden of review would be one of reviewing the entire record.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.073" offset="1307669">In the coerced confession cases, the totality of circumstances approach which has now been rejected, there was on some cases, a legitimate purpose for going in and for the courts undertaking this burden, mainly, the purpose of helping the prosecution if the confession was voluntary, it often was a crucial piece of evidence and the man would -- and the man's conviction would be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.929" offset="1407039">But here by hypothesis of the prosecution, the evidence has no value.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.328" offset="1428668">They are not seeking the burden -- seeking the court to review the facts of cases to obtain utility of otherwise valid evidence because by their own hypothesis, the evidence is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.617" offset="1481853">The State's arguments in its brief that the state courts can be expected to honor the Fourth Amendment is contradicted I think by its irresponsible argument that an application of a harmless error doctrine is a question of state law and not federal and cannot be reviewed by this Court or by the state court or by the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.172" offset="1584044">It is also contradicted by their attempt to trivialize the Preston case.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.465" offset="1605256">The Preston case is a crux of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.901" offset="1614973">There was violation of search and seizure of evidence from an impounded car and the state concedes in its brief that the vehicle forfeiture statute in the State of California did not itself authorize the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.378" offset="1672861">It attempts to argue that the vehicle was in custody under that statute and that therefore the search was legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.099" offset="1699819">These same facts were present in the Preston case.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.972" offset="1715284">The State's argument is nothing more than attempt to evade and trivialize the Preston rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1408.254" offset="5736364">And this was an argument made in that court as we're arguing here that the error was not prejudicial assuming there was any error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.995" offset="5763323">We raised in the brief and I'd like to touch on that point if I have any time, the argument that the search here was not unconstitutional at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.223" offset="5796237">In fact, it was a constitutional reasonable search and the evidence is admissible but I don't want to get off under that right at the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.321" offset="5828629">But we argue that it's true below that assuming there was an error, that error was not prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.350" offset="5848795">Now, we did say, turning over to page 254, that the scrap of brown paper was also highly relevant, that's about two thirds all the way down the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.054" offset="5903548">And there we were drawing on an analogy where the decision of the California Supreme Court in People versus Harem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.496" offset="5929357">We did not say and -- Your Honor, and I don't think we meant to say any place that this evidence was important in the sense of having great weight in the disposition and decision of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.627" offset="5997902">We did say it was highly relevant and I stand by that, it was relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.134" offset="6019950">We don't think it had great weight in effect of the outcome of the case and I think those are compatible positions to please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.101" offset="6063731">Now, it's argued that the District Attorney puts evidence in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.620" offset="6085883">He thinks it's relevant and he thinks it's going to contribute to the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.399" offset="6105004">And consequently, who was he to come up here and say that it's not or that it's only a harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.114" offset="6135829">Well, that's all right if we're penalizing the District Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.553" offset="6161533">But that is not what the appellate court set for, they set to do justice and the constitution of California imposes that duty upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.993" offset="6195388">Now, there's no question in my mind that the District Attorney believe that this evidence was relevant and he believed it was admissible and he believed it tended to prove guilt, otherwise, he wouldn't have put it in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.056" offset="6247633">But that's true in every case; that's true in every case, and the harmless error rule presumes that the evidence will be relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.274" offset="6280443">If it isn't relevant then what is it doing in the case to start with and in itself would be error to admit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.668" offset="6306043">I think there's no question that if -- that the rule presupposes some degree of relevance; that it does tend to prove guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.631" offset="6337912">But that's not the complete answer because if it were, then the rule would be reversal and not a careful consideration of the record and the impact of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.033" offset="6383470">Your Honors have made it clear, going back to Kotteakos and even clear as in Fahy versus Connecticut, if you please, that you will not take that approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.643" offset="6417951">The simple approach, if it was received in evidence and relevant than we'll reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.958" offset="6435192">You didn't do that in Fahy against Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.980" offset="6447313">You didn't do that in Kotteakos which involved a different problem but nevertheless the discussion I think is relevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1695.058" offset="6883558">They observed a man that fit the resemblance of Cooper.</text>

            <text syncTime="1719.250" offset="6980420">Well, they didn't want to walk up and drop him off in front of the place so they dropped him off a block or two away and one of them followed him and there were two other agents who were staked out in other positions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1737.253" offset="7052413">So that they could exclude the possibility that if he returned with heroine, he got it from anybody except Cooper, assuming he did in fact contact Cooper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.215" offset="7104240">If they couldn't exclude the possibility that he got it from anyone else, they would not be satisfied Cooper had sold him the heroine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.615" offset="7133811">It's not only a matter of evidence for the court ultimately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.026" offset="7143528">It's a matter of proving these to themselves because they're not going to take the informant's say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.707" offset="7166203">And they did the best they could to keep him under surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.255" offset="7180413">The informant without going into all of the detail about that, and there's some argument about, well, a couple of witnesses said looking at the car, it appeared to be Cooper and a couple of them did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.952" offset="7235166">There were several identifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.739" offset="7242376">One of the agents, as he walked up to the front of Newels Market saw Cooper turn in, turn of from Cutting Boulevard and head towards the parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.281" offset="7276544">He identified Cooper positively driving the car, this was Cooper's car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.316" offset="7292635">They -- most of them had seen him before, observed him around Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.126" offset="7315832">Two of the officers had the informant in sight at all times from leaving the federal agent's car walking over to the market, going in the lot, contacting Cooper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.166" offset="7360031">There were some conflicts and Mr. Traynor has pointed them out with great detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.347" offset="7380720">The Defense Attorney went through every possible detail of the observation and there were some inconsistencies but that all goes to the question of sufficiency and it goes to the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.641" offset="7429935">In the event, the evidence, there is sufficient evidence that he was observed at all times and Mr. Green, who was the informant returned to the car, a federal agent waiting for him, gave him two bindles of heroine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.190" offset="7492106">Now, the bindles are white paper wrapped around a white powder which is heroine and which was ultimately analyzed and determined to be heroine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.415" offset="7533066">These two white paper bindles were wrapped in a piece of brown paper, a piece of grocery sack paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.966" offset="7559189">And this is the object that was handed to the federal agent in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.615" offset="7581863">Now, that is not the piece of brown paper that we're talking about or that we're concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.811" offset="7606627">There is no problem, I think, before this Court as to the admissibility of the heroine, the paper in which the heroine was contained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.619" offset="7645811">I'll get to the piece of brown paper in just a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.278" offset="7660440">But this is what the case was all about; it was whether Joe Cooper sold heroine to Green, the informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.404" offset="7697011">They had given the informant marked money as their common practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.681" offset="7718118">So that if they picked up whoever sold him the heroine and found the money on him, it would tend to corroborate the fact of the sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="1933.749" offset="7838386">As a matter of fact, they tried to follow him but he got away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.170" offset="7852074">They staked out the car in the downtown Richmond, and about two to three hours later, arrested Joe Cooper when he returned to the car.</text>

            <text syncTime="3579.646" offset="14421974">The portion of the story of this case that was related to you by the Attorney General was fairly stated but it's not the complete story in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.448" offset="14457187">This case is a very weak factual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.553" offset="14469622">It began when the federal agents started the eavesdropping on the defendant's home and turned up no evidence of any sales of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.964" offset="14499192">The next step the police took in this case was to arrest at dawn an unreliable and untrustworthy informer and subject him to several hours of interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.342" offset="14540779">At the conclusion of which, he agreed to act for the police as a participating informer and what is commonly as a police-controlled narcotics buying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.803" offset="14578604">The two officers who were stationed outside the defendant's residence only said that he took the description of the defendant, that the man who came out of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.875" offset="14614862">One of those officers said the man limped.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.064" offset="14623640">The other officer said he'd walked fairly normally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.740" offset="14634297">There was a discrepancy at the outset in their physical identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.774" offset="14654464">The mark money that was given to the informer as one of the ingredients of trying to tie the sale to this defendant was never found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.399" offset="14692916">The other ingredient of trying -- that the officers are trying to tie this sale to the defendant was to have him supervise and constantly observe the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.089" offset="14735757">This attempt failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.046" offset="14743594">Agent Alameda, who was stationed down at the market, lost sight of the informer and the suspect during the crucial two to three minutes of transaction occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.216" offset="14780270">The two other officers were stationed at a point more than a hundred yards away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.262" offset="14796466">Their view was obstructed in part by a passing and parked cars and they also conflicted on the very important part of their testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.971" offset="14831261">One of them placed the informer inside the car on the right hand side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.621" offset="14849860">The other one placed the informer had to be standing outside the car at the driver's side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.642" offset="14873893">Mrs. Galley (ph), who is the aunt of defendant that was home, they've tried to place him in residence with regard to the phone call on re-direct examination, was asked about the phone call.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.937" offset="14931153">She said, "I've answered the phone and I've told him that only the girls that would be calling him."</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.376" offset="14952887">In this case, we had a testimony that there was a man calling and not girls.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.484" offset="14977337">The participating unreliable untrustworthy informer was never produced as a witness at this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.422" offset="15009102">He was never in the case although he was the really most important salient witness against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.901" offset="15030941">The defendant took the stand and testified in his own behalf and contradicted the testimony of these police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.188" offset="15060093">This was such a weak case that the prosecutor must have thought and did think that every piece of paper, every scarp of evidence including a scrap of paper would be necessary to contribute to a conviction and so it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.103" offset="15119757">It is for this reason in the constant references to the attempt of the prosecutor to establish the connection between brown paper, the swallowing of the piece of brown paper package at the time of the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.332" offset="15172733">The defendant's use of the brown paper in testimony during his unconstitutional interrogation at the police station and the placement and finally and most importantly the placement of this illegal piece of paper in the very same exhibit as the subject of the crime for which the man was charged.</text>

            <text syncTime="4008.900" offset="16138951">Preston -- I don't think should be read as simply establishing the outer limits otherwise, to read it otherwise would discourage the state and federal courts from taking the decision to this Court and following them and applying them in the cases where they should be controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="4027.443" offset="16213138">The District Court of Appeal properly, I think, interpreted the Preston case to apply to this.</text>

            <text syncTime="4038.995" offset="16259323">The state's reliance on the Ninth Circuit Federal Court case under the narcotics statutes is a case that didn't even bother to cite the Preston case even though it was decided after it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.245" offset="16308328">The -- there's really no justification for distinguishing the Preston case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4055.804" offset="16326614">What the state is really attempting to do is to overrule the Preston case or to trivialize it by exceptions that there are no available exceptions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.959" offset="16383248">The important point I wanted to make coming back is that this was an extremely weak case against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.426" offset="16417102">Every piece -- every scrap of paper was necessary and it was used and it hurt and it hurt the defendant in the trial court and it hurt him in the appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4088.918" offset="16459003">And for that reason his conviction was unconstitutionally obtained and for that reason also it must be reversed respectfully.</text>
