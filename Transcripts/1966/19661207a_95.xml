          <turn speaker="morris_lavine" startTime="23.925" stopTime="798.038">
            <label>Mr. Morris Lavine</label>
            <text syncTime="23.925" offset="199032">This is an appeal from the decision of a Supreme Court of California on a death penalty case involving the petitioner Thomas LeRoy Teale and life sentence of Ruth Elizabeth Chapman who was -- both of whom were convicted in San Joaquin County following a trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.947" offset="303208">At the beginning, I would like to make two corrections or in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.223" offset="328286">I call the attention to the clerk of the Court that this case came up during the pendency of the Griffin case and as stated in the respondent's brief on page 15 all over conviction in the case at bar was obtained in 1963, the processes on direct appeal have not been completed prior to Griffin and hence the Griffin rule would apply say for the application of a harmless error rule of page 15 in the respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.381" offset="452942">I want to call that correction to Your Honors because in my summary of the argument, I stated that the Griffin case have been fully decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.113" offset="483871">This was incorrect and I call it to the attention of the clerk didn't get corrected in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.549" offset="505605">The second point I wish to call to Your Honors' attention is the fact that Article 6 Section 4.5 the so-called harmless error rule in the State of California has been practically readopted in its words on November 8, 1966 when California adopted a partial set of amendments to its State Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.759" offset="598392">So, where we refer to Article 6, Section 4.5 of the California constitution that is now Article 6, Section 13 of the California Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.190" offset="644159">Well, however, it would -- it is practically the same in its wording as it was prior I think there's just one word changed but not materially to affect anything that we argue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.147" offset="695986">The -- this case involves the question of the comment of the prosecutor throughout the case in his argument in the circumstantial evidence case.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.058" offset="743633">In -- prior to Griffin versus California, which Your Honors remember, the Supreme Court of California sent a case to this Court, sent copies of its decision, I believe in Modesto -- People versus Modesto.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.801" offset="798595">I believe Justice Brennan will recall during the oral argument he called the attention the fact that the Supreme Court of California was trying to prejudge this Court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.840" offset="838719">After this Court passed on Griffin versus California and reversed Griffin on the basis of comments by the prosecutor on the failure of the defendant take the stand, California again repetition this Court or rehearing which was denied and raised this question of the harmless error rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.772" offset="938506">Now, again we have in Chapman and Teale versus California the question, the admitted the fact that throughout the argument of the prosecutor there were complete comments by the prosecutor on the failure of the defendants plural to take the witness stand and this Court has set forth for a decision by this case whether the violation of Griffin versus California, number 609 was error, cannot be harmless in this case and so I will meet both of those questions on those so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.511" offset="1097435">First of all, I think there is own case that Your Honors have had before you where there has been such a replete and continues argument on the failure of a defendant to take the witness stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.437" offset="1157099">The -- in this case, the very briefly the facts are, did the bartender was found dead in a gulley on October 18, 1963 and at the time of his having been found there, the state traced back the case and commenced the prosecution arresting Mrs. Chapman on October 26 and bring her back and taking her statement, taking her to the district attorney's office where she made an 84-page statement as of 1963, it was October 18, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.576" offset="1337657">The -- she was taken to the district attorney's office and there she was questioned extensively and made an 84-page statement without the benefit or advice of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.305" offset="1396590">While the statement itself was that -- has reduced in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.110" offset="1415816">She was urged to see a psychiatrist and the district attorney secured a psychiatrist to see her and his testimony before the Court was largely based upon this 84-page statement which he made to the district attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.178" offset="1484048">Now, the prosecutor went back, Mr. Ferguson who was the deputy district attorney went back to pick up Teale after he was arrested on November 2 and thereafter came back with Teale who was placed in a cell with another man who later became a witness against Teale.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.764" offset="1574431">But neither Chapman nor Teale took the witness stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.954" offset="1591150">They stood on their constitutional rights both defendants were indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.179" offset="1612048">The Supreme -- the Court appointed counsel, the public defender was first appointed and later got relieved because of a conflict of interest and these two gentlemen were appointed by the Court to represent the defendants in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.499" offset="1673383">Mr. Richard Johnson who sits here was the former assistant district attorney in San Joaquin County and the other lawyers and immanent lawyer of the bar there and they saw the case through the Supreme Court of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.651" offset="1725942">Now, upon their advice and on the advice of their counsel, neither one of these defendants took the witness stand but the prosecutor kept repeatedly buttressing his case where he lack proof with arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.766" offset="1794487">Now, these people could tell you what they chose not to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.198" offset="1812146">It would take me nearly all of my time that to read some of these comments but I'm going to read a few just to call to Your Honors' attention the many places in this lengthy record where the defendants were found guilty on the basis of comments by the prosecutor and later by the direction of the Court that they could've taken the stand and if they did not then that the jury could draw from that fact the inference that they were guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.132" offset="1955924">On page 20 of my opening brief, I set forth Ruth Chapman is sitting right over here.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.738" offset="1994376">She is one of the defendants in this case and she is the one who certainly if anyone in this room or in this state knows what was in those boxes, she is the one.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.994" offset="2039306">But once again she did not take the stand, raise her right hand and tell you about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.087" offset="2063757">She didn't take the stand at all ladies and gentlemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.938" offset="2075146">She could've come up and tells you -- us exactly what Articles were set.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.710" offset="2094164">So, you may draw any inferences from that that you wish as long as they are reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.436" offset="2117151">Now, we come first of all to the issue of the gun and the gun that was used or the guns that were used allegedly in the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.160" offset="2147976">Now, the prosecutor says, he doesn't know which gun was used and they brought neither of the guns that were allegedly apart of this transaction were ever found by the prosecutor brought in similar guns or guns that were suppose to be like those that were used.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.020" offset="2239404">And now, the prosecutor then argues here.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.871" offset="2282872">He says that now, page 1808 of the reporter's transcript and incidentally the transcript was not transcribed but you have the copy of the original record here in the clerk's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.191" offset="2352149">Now, ladies and gentlemen, I don't know which one of these weapons was purchased first.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.291" offset="2372524">I don't know that it particularly makes any difference but as you know we have had no testimony at all in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.373" offset="2404916">In fact, I might add that the only person or persons I could give testimony in that regard would be of course the defendants themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.612" offset="2441801">So, we don't know when they were purchased or rather we know the date but we don't know the exact time or what sequence was for this I refer to here for the record people's exhibit number 14, there's 32 caliber pistol which was purchased by the defendant Ruth Elizabeth Chapman.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.405" offset="2512959">Now, he says they don't have the weapon but they've got a replica there.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.856" offset="2538768">Now, he says they can't tell what he goes on at some pages of argument and that he says they can't tell which weapon was used and they don't know but the defendants if they took the stand could tell the Court which weapon was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.123" offset="2615881">So, he says, it's a constitutional right in both of these defendants see to fit to avail themselves of that constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.246" offset="2656319">But I say to you ladies and gentlemen, there are many things in this case and I will try to point them out to you at least probably not all that these defendants are in a position to take that stand and to testify under oath and give you facts concerning.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.084" offset="2719744">They have not seen fit to avail themselves of the opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.260" offset="2740433">Then again, he says, now up to this point page 1824 of the reporter's transcript, I appeal that the testimony clearly shows that the defendants, number one, there is motive, not in necessity item to the crime at all but only helpful, ladies and gentlemen, to determine whether or not they committed it and then he talks about a check that was passed without sufficient funds and he says, later on at page 1826.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.493" offset="2897377">Now, ladies and gentlemen in reference to the weapons being purchased in Reno, Nevada on October 12 you have heard ladies and gentlemen no testimony and you will recall clearly you were going to have some difficulty, you really are as reference to what is and what is evidence in this case and believe me I have a few comments to say on that a little later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.143" offset="2991940">But if you will recall as far as evidence is concerned or of the truth of anything at all, you don't have any evidence on why these pistols were purchased?</text>
            <text syncTime="733.052" offset="3035617">Why did Ruth Elizabeth Chapman buy two weapons?</text>
            <text syncTime="736.419" offset="3049096">Well, you do recall that she told on one occasion that she had a piston stolen from her vehicle and when she was taking a little trip across the country, you remember that testimony and then I'm skipping now.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.136" offset="3103953">Then he says -- then he says, but certainly the defendant Ruth Elizabeth Chapman could tell you, she could tell you one under oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.843" offset="3130702">She could subject herself to cross-examination and she could tell you then and it would evidence before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.871" offset="3158810">Once again, she has not chosen to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.159" offset="3171976">So, any inference you may draw there from will be an adverse inference under the circumstances and under the instructions of a court, you are exclusive judges of the fact themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.998" offset="3219414">And I could continue on and I have quoted several of these other passages in my brief and then the comments on Teale, page 1854 of the record of the comments on --</text>

            <text syncTime="802.705" offset="3314186">Maybe I'm wrong but I thought the issue was not whether these particular comments were harmless that and the state's submission whether on the basis of the balance of the evidence, the case was overwhelming so that the error complain did not result in miscarriage of justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="835.238" offset="3444276">So, we're to supply what the prosecution was unable to prove in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.051" offset="3475623">Now, we come to the question of whether or not this Court has ever held that the violation of a constitutional right is harmless error and we come to the point that Your Honor has just raised in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.403" offset="3536959">I wanted to lay the predicate, Your Honor, of the terrific amount of comments made throughout to show just how the prosecutor supplied the absence of proof that was his burden by comments by him as to the failure of the defendants to take the witness stand and to supply what the Griffin case says cannot be supplied to use the silence of the defendant as the basis of conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1216.752" offset="4970350">This is 326 U.S. of page 607, the Court there after calling the jury back gave them further instructions which it was held it was erroneous.</text>

            <text syncTime="1254.200" offset="5120188">The Government argues that the sting of error is extracted because there was proof other than the erroneous presumption on the issue of Bollenbach's participation and I'm skipping some things that would be along jump at guessing to be confident that the jury did not rely on the erroneous presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.096" offset="5191764">The charge should not be misleading, legal presumptions involve settled conception to which not even judges always bring clear understandingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.830" offset="5230738">We cannot treat the manifest misdirection in the circumstances of this case as one of those technical errors which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties and must be disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.250" offset="5284342">All law is technical if viewed solely from the concern for punishing crime without hitting the mode which is accomplished, the technical errors against which Congress protected jury verdicts are of a kind which led some judges to trivialize law by giving all legal prescriptions equal potency, see Taft and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.872" offset="5370859">Deviations from formal correctness do not touch the substance of the standards by which guilt is determined in our Court and under these that Congress rendered harmless citing Bruno versus United States and Wyler versus United States presuming to often that all errors to be prejudicial the judicial pendulum need not swing to presume all errors to be harmless if only the appellate court is left in doubt without doubt that one who claims that correct due process is after all guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.630" offset="5493844">In view of the place of importance, the trial by jury has in our bill of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.735" offset="5514324">It is not to be supposed that Congress intended to substitute the belief of appellate judges in the guilt of an accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.226" offset="5544312">However, justifiably engendered by the dead record for ascertainment of guilt by a jury under appropriate judicial guidance however cumbersome that process may be and the judgment in that case was reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.756" offset="5598438">Now, the Court there laid down the standard that I think is the standard that I'm urging on this Court in the question of harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.079" offset="5631666">Now, in Bruno versus United States, in 308 U.S. October term 1939, page 293, the Court there said a subsidiary question remains for determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.939" offset="5695091">It derives from the act of February 26, 1919 whereby appellate courts are on their duty in criminal as well as civil cases to regard that -- disregard technical errors, defects or exceptions which do not affect the substantial right to the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.807" offset="5762591">Is this regard of the right which Congress came to Bruno an error?</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.267" offset="5780459">The commission of which we may disregard we hold not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.429" offset="5797073">It would be idle to predetermine the scope of such remedial provisions of Section 391 by anticipating the myriad varieties of rulings made in trial in attempting to abstract include definitions of technical errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.080" offset="5859662">Suffice to this to indicate when every student behind the act of February 26, 1919 knows that act was intended to prevent matters concerned which mere etiquette of trials with the formalities and minutiae or procedure from touching the merits of a verdict of a different order of importance is the right of an accused to insist on the privilege which Congress has given him and to paraphrase that expression of a different order of importance is the right of an accused to insist on the privilege which the Constitution of the United States that has given to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.520" offset="6021413">To suggest -- to the suggested benefits a defendant fails to take the stand not to have the attention of the jury directly to that effect, it suffices to say that however difficult it maybe to exercise enlightened self interest, the accused should be allowed to make his own choice when an Act of Congress authorizes him to choose and now I paraphrase that again and say that the Constitution of the United States has authorized him to choose and whether this urged that it is a psychologically impossibility not to have a presumption rights of the minds of jurors against an accused who fail to testify to sure the answer is that Congress legislated on the contrary assumption and not without support of experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.177" offset="6208031">It was for Congress to decide whether it was deemed legally sufficient what was psychologically futile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.812" offset="6234572">Certainly, despite the vast accumulation of psychological data, we have not yet obtain that servitude about the human mind which would justify us in disregarding the will of Congress by dogmatic assumption that jurors have probably is -- properly admonished either could nor would he, the destructions of the trial court that the failure of the accused to be a witness in his own cause shall not create any presumption against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.060" offset="6343659">And there, the Court held that if the accused asked for that instruction he should be given and they hold that that is a substantial question which ought to be presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.796" offset="6390575">Now, in the case of Wyler versus United States, Your Honors will recall that was a case involving the question of one or two witnesses in a perjury case and the Court there held that the two witness rule was still required, that case is reported in 323 U.S, at page 600 -- reading from page 611.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.434" offset="6513142">It is argued that this error did not prejudice the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.912" offset="6527039">We cannot say that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.194" offset="6536129">The jury convicted without being instructed that more than the testimony with single witness was required to justify their verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.477" offset="6565282">This was no mere technical error relating to the formalities and minutiae of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.263" offset="6592449">This is what I am urging Justice Black in answer to your question that there maybe formalities in minutiae in connection with the trial that would be excused but if it was a constitutional violation as all of your cases we have held on this right of self-incrimination it is not the mere technical error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.924" offset="6667055">We are not authorized to look at the printed record result conflicting evidence and reached the conclusion that the error was harmless because we think that the defendant was guilty that would be to substitute of our judgment or that of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.545" offset="6725569">And under our system of justice, juries alone have been entrusted with that responsibility and I may say the same as in the State of California under Article 1, Section 7 as it existed the time of this case defendant was entitled to a jury trial, had a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.921" offset="6791084">It's not for the appellate court or the Supreme Court of California or even this Court to substitute its judgment or the judgment of the trial jurors who see the witnesses and hear the witnesses nor are we compelled to conclude that this error was harmless because of actions of another case which they cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.673" offset="6866108">Now, that this case was decided on the basis of its own facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.290" offset="6880528">Now, one other case that Your Honors decided recently was the case of Stewart versus United States and reported in 366 U.S. at page 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.936" offset="6939146">In that case, the petitioner was tried three times in the federal court for murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.393" offset="6960985">The first two trials, he didn't take the witness stand, the third trial he did and he was asked the question that he have not taken the witness stand on the earlier two trials.</text>

            <text syncTime="1797.961" offset="7295248">The Government stresses the fact that the question was not emphasized by any reference to what in the instructions to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.015" offset="7323460">During the course of this argument, the Government expressly recognizes that the danger of the situation would've been increased by a cautionary instruction in that such of instruction would have again brought the jury's attention to petitioner's prior failure to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.674" offset="7386049">Plainly, the defense was under no such, no obligation to take such a risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.272" offset="7408410">The motion for mistrial was entirely appropriate and indeed necessary to protect the interest of petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.750" offset="7434324">We, thus, conclude that this conviction and sentence against petitioner cannot stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="1925.961" offset="7807248">I have cited about seven cases in my brief involving particularly confessions and other constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.941" offset="7839117">But I have been unable to find any of which says that the failure that there's any situation which -- in which the right of self-incrimination has been brought in that is to have this Court has held to be harmless and the cases I have cited, I think are in support of that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.305" offset="7920619">I take the position that the harmless error rule was not meant to overlook violations of constitutional magnitude and I think that in this case looking at this record and the numerous comments by the prosecutor as planning the lack of proof that the state have with the comments of the prosecutor constituted the error highly prejudicial and certainly not harmless in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.721" offset="8038275">So, my argument is two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.280" offset="8048515">First, that any violation of Griffin, any violation of failure to take the comment on the failure of a defendant take the witness stand is itself error that requires that it's a constitutional magnitude and therefore does not come within the harmless error rule but if it does, the repeated and constant comments on this case make the error of such magnitude that it is not harmless in this case and it's very highly prejudicial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2322.846" offset="9394761">Suppose what you are arguing here if I understand it, there's no evidence in this record if the California courts were using their harmless error rule to avoid or frustrate the federal constitutional right, isn't that what you're arguing?</text>

            <label>Mr. Arlo E. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="2336.117" offset="9447842">But -- yes, I wish to make that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.312" offset="9456619">I was simply arguing that this point that there was no misconduct that but that is an argument that I do seek to pursue, the allegation has been made here that indeed the harmless error rule has been applied deliberately by the California courts to avoid the operation of Griffin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.008" offset="9535404">We have cited in our briefs cases where the District Courts of Appeal or intermediate appellate courts in fact have affirmed convictions where commenting in violation of Griffin occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.550" offset="9589530">Likewise, we have brought to your attention some dozen cases where the California Courts have reversed those convictions because it found the comment in the context of the entire case to be a miscarriage of justice, to be a -- to be prejudicial, to be harmful to violate our harmless error rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.611" offset="9697782">Likewise, the California Supreme Court has granted here in cases where the intermediate appellate courts have found the comment to be harmless and affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.812" offset="9742608">So, in fact there was no deliberate use of the harmful error rule to undercut the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.821" offset="9790673">But returning, if I may, to the general allegation that's been made here in reference to the conspiracy to keep the defendant Chapman on the stand the allegations that somehow the -- she was denied counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.182" offset="9864129">There was a denial of the speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.657" offset="9878026">Let me correct that record before we discuss the real questions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.830" offset="9910732">Under California practice, award was based upon a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.383" offset="9944900">Mrs. Chapman was arrested in St. Joseph, Missouri October 26, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.813" offset="9978650">She was brought back to California, the record shows and we cited it, October 30, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.072" offset="10015640">The record reflects that she was arraigned in California the very next day, October 31 or she was advised of her right to counsel of all the rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.588" offset="10065690">A counsel was then appointed, immediately appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.514" offset="10081468">Not a month later as suggested by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.004" offset="10095365">And the same sequence occurred in reference to the defendant Teale when he was brought back from Louisiana and of course after the initial arraignment instead of proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.408" offset="10148968">By way of information, that case was brought to the grand jury and the indictment was then brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.535" offset="10185540">The defendants were re-arraigned on November 16, counsel was again appointed to defend them in that indictment, the very same counsel that had been appointed on the earlier dates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.519" offset="10257429">Finally, there's an allegation here that the defendant -- that the prosecutor here kept the defendant Chapman from taking the stand by virtue of the delays, by virtue of -- this was part of his tactic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.640" offset="10345932">But I think that if you examine this record you will see very plainly that the trial dates, the times and the trial dates were agreed to by her counsel that it was suggested shortly before the first trial date that there was a conflict that the public between the two defendants and the public defendant could not properly represent both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.655" offset="10450004">The Court immediately appointed separate counsel for Mrs. Chapman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.823" offset="10470693">Shortly thereafter and a new trial date was again selected about a month forward, the defendant Chapman filed an affidavit alleging in demanding in support of a motion for a separate trial alleging that the public defender had special knowledge which could be used in cross examining her.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.115" offset="10551881">The judge then denied the motion for a separate trial and appointed new counsel for the defendant Teale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.660" offset="10586049">The matter was then delayed for another month in order that that counsel could properly prepare and defend the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.010" offset="10631398">Finally, there's an allegation that somehow made here again in argument that the prosecutor sought to get her statement which she said -- he said was taken without counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.541" offset="10705586">The record reflects in fact that what he is referring to appears to be statement which the defendant introduced via the testimony of a psychiatrist and I think important to this entire case is the defense and this goes to the defense of Mrs. Chapman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.747" offset="10814360">Mrs. Chapman's defense was from the very outset in this case that she was present in all times, that she did not, however, have the specific intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.963" offset="10891264">Now, the -- in California or practices for the prosecutor to make an opening statement present his testimony, the defense counsel to make his opening statement and to present his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.425" offset="10941106">However, in this case, after the prosecutor had made his opening statement, defense counsel requested opportunity to make his opening statement out of term and the judge granted that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.536" offset="10993560">He then stated as his defense in fact in admission of her presence at the scene of the robbery, that kidnapping and the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.987" offset="11059284">The defense then established through that the psychiatrist not Dr. Winkler but Dr. Sherman, the defense psychiatrist that she did not or possibly had a hysterical alcoholic blackout, disassociated status the psychiatrist say that she could not formulate the specific intent to commit these crimes but as a part of that basis for the psychiatrist's opinion, the psychiatrist testifies both as to what she had told them and over objection by the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.755" offset="11262412">Defense counsel read a statement which she gave or read great portions of the statement which he had previously given to the deputy district attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.221" offset="11296266">There is no foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.250" offset="11304417">The statement was at no time offered by the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.918" offset="11319045">There is nothing in the record as to the background for the taking of the statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2825.609" offset="11405772">Dr. Winkler was simply called then in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.118" offset="11427819">And further I think it is important of course in any event that we must examine the entire record, the entire case and not merely as counsel for petitioner has asserted that we look at the -- only at the statements made here, the instruction given or the comment made and determined from that whether or not there was harm.</text>
