            <text syncTime="26.977" offset="211257">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Mr. District Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.494" offset="233305">This case comes before the Court on a writ of certiorari to the Third Circuit, United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.101" offset="271757">Narrowly stated the question presented in the case as whether the Court of Appeals erred in denying this petitioner leave to appeal in form of paupers from a decision of the United States District Court for the western district of Pennsylvania which had discharged an order in connection with a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.738" offset="358275">I think more broadly stated the question in the case whether this Court and whether in fact the federal system administration and justice, can make a reality of the emblem of the Court which is carved in stone on the front of the Court, equal justice under law.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.526" offset="441448">Basically, the question which presents itself to the Court is an interpretation of the statute in my opinion, namely 28 U.S. Code Section 1915, now that Section or that statute provides basically the procedure or the scheme whereby indigent proceedings may be brought in the courts of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.611" offset="537788">It's a very general statute and it applies to any court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.880" offset="562866">It says that they may -- any court may authorize the commencement and certainly of any suit without prepayment of fees, cause and security etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.916" offset="599019">An appeal may not be taken in form of paupers if the trial court certifies in writing that it is not taken in good faith, so that it applies equally to appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.012" offset="647398">Part or subsection (d) of the statute says “The court may request an attorney to represent any such person, and that any such person unable to employ counsel, it may dismiss the case if the allegation of poverty is untrue or it satisfied that the action is frivolous or malicious.”</text>
            <text syncTime="155.742" offset="726392">Now I think the question in this case is that what stage in the proceedings may the court, whichever court it may be, use that part of 28 U.S. Code Section 1915.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.036" offset="783548">Now since Griffin against Illinois in 1955, I think this Court has made it clear and in a long series of cases dealing with appeal matters that any invidious discrimination against an indigent defendant will not be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.690" offset="858154">Now, the question is how do you decide if the discrimination in any particular case is invidious.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.545" offset="893576">In Douglas against California, there was a procedure whereby the Courts of Appeal of a state in that case, would decide if the issues were frivolous or faceless, and then in that event they would decide that counsel need not be required and they would not appoint counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.154" offset="971943">And in that case which came on before this Court, this Court held that that was not equal to the type of appeal which is allowed to a man of means and they struck down that part of the California procedures.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.738" offset="1262320">Now, I always thought or at least it seemed to me the most striking difference between the procedures available was the letter which was sent back to him by the clerk of the United States Court of Appeals after that court had denied his right to the relief requested, she wrote back and said “By order of October 4, 1965, the court denied your motion for reconsideration.”</text>
            <text syncTime="313.430" offset="1357093">He had filed a motion for reconsideration, and said “You may choose either of the following alternatives.</text>

            <text syncTime="347.020" offset="1491466">Now he chose the second alternative whether because he didn't have the $25 or not we don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.163" offset="1516022">But the point is that he couldn't get into the Court of Appeals without paying the $25.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.405" offset="1544965">If he'd had the $25 they would've accepted his motion to docket the appeal out of time, and then of course he would be authorized to proceed himself I take it.</text>

            <text syncTime="370.417" offset="1585089">Well I take it if you're right here, all that required of us is to direct the Court of Appeals to docket his appeal and proceed at it, is that it?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Daniel J. O'Hern</label>
            <text syncTime="383.068" offset="1635662">Well that would be one way of doing it Mr. Justice, but I personally feel that the issue here is somewhat broader than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.948" offset="1667114">I think there is an important question here with respect to the procedures to be followed in general by the Courts of Appeal in such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.040" offset="1703581">I think that this Court has decided in the collateral attack field just recently this term after my brief had been filed in Long against Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.883" offset="1750915">That on an appeal in a collateral attack case on state court, the petitioner or the person seeking the relief is entitled to a transcript of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.107" offset="1799816">And I think implied in that decision is the holding that also counsel would be required in collateral attack cases on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.336" offset="1836701">Now, we're over now to the second step that is the federal collateral attack proceeding after a petitioner has exhausted all of his proceedings in the state courts then he's entitled to go into the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.438" offset="1893125">And the practice generally appears to be to assign counsel, although the lower court cases say that there is not a right to counsel in habeas corpus cases because they say it is a civil proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.751" offset="1946415">But the practice generally is to appoint counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.268" offset="1960417">So then the case comes on for appeal and the Third Circuit I take it, examine the papers and concluded that there was not a meritorious question.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.411" offset="2012975">And I think what they did was to shortcut the procedure of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.363" offset="2032828">Statute says that if the trial court certifies the appeals taken in good faith then it should be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.280" offset="2060518">Now it has been suggested that perhaps if the courts were cynical, they would docket the appeals and then dismiss them, but I think then they would be stuck with their own procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.446" offset="2109106">The Third Circuit for example, requires that a motion to dismiss an appeal must be served five days than others and the briefs are allowed and usually counsel argue in the Third Circuit on a motion to dismiss an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.035" offset="2171486">And I think there's another value to that because once you get to that point in a proceeding, the burden of proof on the party seeking to dismiss the appeal would be of course on the moving part.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.809" offset="2226657">Now I think that the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in this case has almost said that the appellant has the burden of showing that there is some merit to his client.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="543.113" stopTime="553.984">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="543.113" offset="2275871">Even though he has the certificate of probable cause and the district judge who heard the case denied him relief but said nevertheless he has a non-frivolous claim, is that you --</text>

          <turn speaker="daniel_j_ohern" startTime="553.984" stopTime="624.148">
            <label>Mr. Daniel J. O'Hern</label>
            <text syncTime="553.984" offset="2319339">That is what the District Court found.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.006" offset="2331355">I think that some of the members of this Court have said in cases where a district judge in direct appeal in a federal criminal case, has issued that certificate of probable cause then that the Court of Appeals automatically to docket the appeal and assign counsel to the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.205" offset="2416201">Now, I recognized that we are one step removed, but I suggest to the Court that the procedure followed by the Third Circuit is going to lead to the problems which this Court has seen in the direct appeal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.824" offset="2474715">I think you're going to eventually have to conclude that where a man contests this certificate of the district judge he should be entitled to counsel to assist him in contesting the certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.707" offset="2530200">That was decided here in Ellis or Johnson, I'm not sure exactly which one, but either one of those cases this Court decided that the district judge's finding is not conclusive of the issue of probable cause or a good faith.</text>

            <text syncTime="1329.687" offset="5422164">I don't want to belabor this point, but I would like to go back to the question which I think Mr. Justice White put whether it's 2253 of Title 28 that were concerned with or 28 U.S. Code, Section 1915.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.759" offset="5486425">And perhaps I have confused the Court somewhat by treating this as an appeal as a matter of right, which in my opinion it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.108" offset="5519757">But I think you must consider the what we call the fees and cost section of 28 Section -- beginning at Section 1911, and it says “The fees and cost to be charged and collected in each Court of Appeals shall be proscribed from time to time by the judicial conference.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.475" offset="5593318">And then Rule 21 of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rules provides that the appellant or petitioner shall before the docketing of the case pay the docketing fee, but this payment shall not be required by the United States when a party or of the appellant or petitioner in a case authorized to be prosecuted without prepayment of costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.809" offset="5682657">And the only provision for prosecution of the case without prepayment of cost is in 28 U.S. Code, Section 1915.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.177" offset="5716093">So that although 2253 is an initial step, I think in this case will pass that and although it appears to be an appeal of right, it's not an appeal of right if Nowakowski had had the money he could've had an appeal of right of course.</text>

            <text syncTime="1876.371" offset="7608822">He was paroled on this charge in June of 1964 and began to serve a subsequent sentence which was imposed on a prison breach charge and the maximum sentence on this burglary conviction that is the subject of this appeal expired in December of 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.319" offset="7720626">Mr. Nowakowski at the present time serving a four to ten year sentence on prison breach which began in 1964 when he was paroled and subsequently he is faced with service of two and half to five years on account of an assault by a prisoner charge, where he assaulted an employee of the Western Penitentiary in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.210" offset="7848208">I point that out to the Court for the reason that the matter involved -- the sentence involved in this particular case in which the trial and counsel at the trial of the burglary conviction is the subject matter of, basically of the petition for writ of habeas corpus.</text>

            <text syncTime="3109.471" offset="12541262">The only comment I wanted to make was with respect to your question of whether this case represents a supporting a law, the respondent filed that a brief at pages 8 and 9 of which there are a number of cases which contain language to the effect that the Courts of Appeal have discretion with respect to these pauper appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.277" offset="12636453">And I think that is, from my reading of the cases, the prevailing opinion in the Circuit Courts of Appeal that they have a discretion under 28 U.S. Code, Section 1915 to deny the leave to appeal in form of paupers if they are satisfied that the issues are frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.950" offset="12715133">I think if you analogize it to the direct appeal cases, I think they are reading the same type of thinking into these collateral attack appeals, and putting this issue of frivolity to themselves as a matter of initial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.318" offset="12784619">And then once they reach that conclusion and they say that we have this discretion to deny the leave to appeal in form of paupers, and that carries with it everything, then the application for counsel, the application for the transcript and whatever other assistance the petitioner or the pauper needs to make a worthwhile appeal are denied to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.964" offset="12875212">Now I think that is the kind of invalid discrimination that this Court has struck down in the past.</text>
