            <text syncTime="36.078" offset="247724">Mr. Herzog.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert P. Herzog</label>
            <text syncTime="37.774" offset="254516">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.736" offset="278340">A milestone in constitutional law was reached by this Court in 1938 when it held in Erie against Tompkins Railroad Company that in cases involving disputes between citizens of different states the Federal Court hearing such a case will settle the case on the basis of the applicable state substantive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.909" offset="390980">This ruling was made to inform uniformity, that we show uniformity of decision in litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.810" offset="430582">This case brings again the problem of Erie before this Court and in particularly, it's application to the Federal Arbitration Act and contracts concerning that Act in litigation between citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.553" offset="509576">The facts in this case are that these bodies entered into a contract, an employment contract, which contained the an arbitration clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.044" offset="551581">The petitioners subsequently discovered or alleged that it had been fraudulently induced to make this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.692" offset="590137">The petitioner instituted an action in the Court below in the Southern District of New York alleging equitable fraud and sought a recession of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.379" offset="640920">The jurisdiction of the Court below was based solely upon diversity of the parties and jurisdictional amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.813" offset="674670">The respondent had immediately prior to the institution of this action demanded arbitration pursuant to the statutes and laws of the State of New York, Section 7503(c) of the New York State Civil Rules and Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.311" offset="752619">The Respondent additionally has disputed throughout these proceedings the factual allegations of fraud made by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.063" offset="799640">These factual allegations pertinent here is that the petitioner would have never made this contract, had it had not been for the representation by the respondent that it was a solvent corporation?</text>
            <text syncTime="193.227" offset="876231">Seven days after the respondent and petitioner made this contract the respondent filed a voluntary petition in Chapter 11 in the District Court of New Jersey, and suffered a receivership of its property.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.267" offset="944462">In fact the agreement which was signed on October 7th had been accelerated at the request of the respondent, and seven days later a Chapter 11 proceeding suit and receivership.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.122" offset="1027845">In the federal action, which the petitioner brought motions were made simultaneously with its institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.181" offset="1064103">A motion was made by the petitioner under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to stay the demand for arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.616" offset="1097853">This was required because New York Law or under the Law of New York petitioner would have been substantively prevented from challenging the validity of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.769" offset="1146441">The respondent made a cross motion to stay the Federal action and on the other hand compelled arbitration pursuant to the arbitration clause contained in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.013" offset="1191476">Thus the essential question presented here is what tribunal in the first instance is going to investigating the site, a preliminary threshold question of fraud, will it be a Court of Law or it will be an arbitration panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.987" offset="1279352">The differences I don't think are pertinent at the moment because this Court in Bernhardt and in Wilko v. Swan has gone into the radical difference between arbitration in a Court of Law and the substantial effect that each tribunal can have on the result and outcome of the course of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.117" offset="1359809">The courts below in this matter have uniformly applied the precedent established by Judge Medina in the Second Circuit in the case of Robert Lawrence Company versus Devonshire Fabrics.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.176" offset="1416025">This case is incidentally is in conflict with decisions in the Sixth and Ninth Circuit and has been criticized by the First Circuit for some of its proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.400" offset="1464926">Judge Medina in the Lawrence case, and I should say the courts below invoking the Robert Lawrence proposition against the petitioner here relegated the petitioner as a matter of federal substantive law to the arbitration panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.132" offset="1583940">The question of the very validity and existence of this contract and whether the petitioner would have made and entered it was therefore to be decided by the arbitrators under the clause in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.217" offset="1644231">This proposition of law is contrary to the Law of state of New York where this diversity action was prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.125" offset="1687907">Now Judge Medina reached this result by the following legal reasoning in the Lawrence case.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.341" offset="1716746">The reason that the Federal Arbitration Act created national substantive law and to support this substantive -- national substantive law because it would conflict or clash with the Erie doctrine, he devised a doctrine of separability of the causes of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.627" offset="1809847">He reasoned that Congress intended or referred to in an Arbitration Act as an agreement to arbitrate that, that meant the very clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.684" offset="1854151">Through this reasoning he claimed that the contract to arbitrate was separable provision and therefore if you do not allege a fraud as to the clause, then a fraud as to any portion of the agreement, no matter what materiality it had, no matter what the reliances, you are relegated to the informal tribunal of arbitration, notwithstanding the contrary state law which Judge Medina recognized at that time at 1960 to be that a fraud permeates the entire agreement and a fraud as to any other portion of the agreement would therefore -- therefore the whole agreement would fall completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.997" offset="2043382">The second reasoning, he said it was clearly constitutional and the petitioner says that this result of Judge Medina's which conflicts with the Erie principle is obviously unconstitutional, in that you put a premium on the fact that these parties were of diverse citizenship and that further you encourage forum shopping and all the resultant wrongs that Erie sought to correct and third, petitioner asserts that Judge Medina notwithstanding Section 4 which set up a whole procedure for a preliminary hearing on the question of validity of contract said as a matter of law and we feel that he violated the whole intent of Congress in cutting out this problem of a hearing effectively the only hearing you can have under Judge Medina's proposition is if you alleged fraud as the arbitration clause, you don't allege any such fraud, any other issues for the arbitrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.019" offset="2311398">We submit that Judge Medina's legal reasoning is erroneous and conflict with -- except to constitutional limitations announced by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.935" offset="2355075">Now a preliminary question, we recognize and which is one of the issues here is that in order for the Federal Arbitration Act to apply in the first instance, the Court my preliminarily make a determination that the contract evidence as a transaction and interstate commerce or a maritime transaction which is not the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.769" offset="2458415">The petitioner maintains that this contract is a mere employment contract and the contract speaks for itself and for that reason, I will not venture in to this point, I think the briefs are adequate on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.905" offset="2514944">But we continue to say and we move to the second proposition assuming this Court were to find that this case is not four squared in point with Bernhardt versus Polygraphic Company of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.419" offset="2581086">That decision of 1956 written by Mr. Justice Douglas held that Section 3 was not to be construed by Second Circuit as to be so broad as to reach all contracts and that Section 2 was definition on its scope and that therefore Section 3 could only reach those contracts defined in Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.826" offset="2686725">This Court speaking through Mr. Justice Douglas specifically pointed out that we hold this way to avoid the constitutional implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.543" offset="2733537">We hold that this a Bernhardt case, it's an employment contract it's not a transaction, it's not a contract evidencing a transaction in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.713" offset="2786200">Notwithstanding that if the contract were assumed to be in commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act to be applicable, we feel that the Court further erred below in concluding that the Federal Arbitration Act created national substantive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.508" offset="2873448">There is no intent of Congress specified in this Act, either in the act itself or in any of the sub-committee hearings and in the writings of contemporary authors.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.464" offset="2929246">In fact, quite the opposite, the hearings in the Congressional record allude to this Act as being procedural and relating to the law of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.996" offset="2987342">We further maintain that this Court in the Bernhardt case has already indicated that Section 2 was procedural, when it said it was definitional in scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.195" offset="3056201">We further point out to the Court that all the other sections of the Federal Arbitration Act 1 through 14, I should say 3 through 14 are procedural in all of their application and could not possibly be legally construed to have an substantive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.221" offset="3136240">We therefore feel -- now one other point I'd like to make in 1924 just prior to the passage of the Federal Arbitration Act, the Court passed a decision down on this Red Cross Line case by Mr. Justice Brandeis, in that case Mr. Brandeis for the first time established that contracts containing arbitration clauses and arbitration agreements themselves were valid and created a perfect obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.088" offset="3255672">In 1925, we believe the Congress relied on the precedent to the Red Cross case and therefore when Congress created the Federal Arbitration Act and specifically referred to in Section 2, the Act that -- the section of the Act that we are looking at, we say that they didn't intend to create substantive rights because these existed because of the Red Cross -- the Red Cross Line case.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.871" offset="3362879">The validity of a contract was now the law of the land; we therefore say that Congress was merely roaring a procedural statute to enforce what was now an existing right, that is the right to have arbitration contracts recognized as valid and not an ouster of Judicial Court jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="848.038" offset="3495476">I suppose it's essential in your case to establish that New York Law would permit you access to the courts rather than remitting you to the arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="867.966" offset="3575202">To say to you that my attention has been called to application of case of application of Amphenol Corporation 266 New York supplement, second, 768 that was later affirmed in the appellant division, is quite a recent case and that states New York Law to be in accordance with Judge Medina's announcement that is to say that in this sort of a situation even though you are relying on fraud and inducement you've got to got arbitrated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1126.666" offset="4610069">The petitioner maintains that if you look at all this procedural discussion, the intent of the Congress, the hearings, the writers, the fact that the legislation originated out of the judiciary committees of both houses obviously perhaps Article 3 legislation, although Article 1 may have been used for the commerce, course used to buttress this legislation and thus give it a broader legislative base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.680" offset="4742144">If you read Bernhardt and the decisions of this Court and the other sections of the Federal Arbitration Act plus a Red Cross Line, we conclude that it's only susceptible of one conclusion that this Act is procedural in it's application where diversity of citizenship applies.</text>

            <text syncTime="1217.345" offset="4972753">No, Your Honor the Arbitration Act that Congress passed was patented on the New York Act which had been passed five years earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.504" offset="5009429">The New York Courts have characterized the Act when it was being constitutional and the cases cited, -- slip my mind at any rate that the Act was remedial on its application and procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.342" offset="5068779">Congress now passed this act under the sponsorship of the American Bar Association in an attempt to try and permit citizens in the various states to have the same procedural remedies that the states returning to these are regular tribunals of arbitration and particularly and it was more important in the commercial centers of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.735" offset="5158327">Arbitration, if you look at the expansion of it expanded sort of West, its thoughts in the urban centers and then goes throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.693" offset="5190196">So New York possibly being a principle urban center and New Jersey and various other states rapidly fell into law and passing arbitration acts at the insistence of their citizens for whatever commercial needs they needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.542" offset="5241501">And Congress was persuaded of course to undertake similar legislations so there would be problem -- pardon me no problem in the Federal Court coming up with perhaps different results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.575" offset="5289671">We say Congress even recognized there that in a sense to have different system of procedure might work wrongs but we say it was procedural, and it's wholly procedure and even Judge Medina in the Lawrence case and the other lower Courts have held that the Federal arbitration has independent Federal basis for jurisdiction and this is essentially the Erie problem, we're coming to because if you hold it substantive and apply Erie and New York and Oregon the cases involving procedure certain parts of the procedural laws can have substantive outcome on a litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.819" offset="5470647">We are going to find a situation where the opposite of Erie occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.606" offset="5493844">It's not the fact that you are diverse citizen that works so wrong, it's the fact that the contract is between citizens of the same states, the new two New Yorkers that have an that have arbitration and fraud will vitiate it have a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.304" offset="5564583">A hypothetical would be, if I contract with my opponent here to ship interstate goods to California and it's under $10,000, there is no independent right to get into Court and we arbitrate and an attempt to arbitrate is made in New York, I have worked in New York law to my favor and the contract falls under current law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.385" offset="5652877">But if we were diverse citizens, if he was a Jersey resident we could then forum shop and pick our Court, go into the Federal Court and a different result would follow if you follow Judge Medina's Lawrence holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.672" offset="5722049">Therefore we say the proper rule of law to apply to this type of litigation is a rule of common law or the state common law that fraud vitiates the entire agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.476" offset="5785266">Now, we say the Congress intended to because they saved this in Section 2 of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1752.863" offset="7114794">The question before this Court is one of congressional intent, did Congress intend to enact a national law of governing arbitration agreements in contracts involving interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.971" offset="7179264">If this Court finds affirmatively on that question, we've then reached a second question as to whether the second circuit properly applied the national law.</text>
