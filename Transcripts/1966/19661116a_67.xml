            <label>Mr. Justice Learned Hand</label>
            <text syncTime="11.557" offset="149608">Mr. Chief Justice, may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.230" offset="164342">Yesterday, before the recess, the Chief Justice asked me whether or what the police of the Department of State was with regard to newsman traveling to areas on which geographic restrictions had been imposed by the Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.367" offset="236857">I’ve been advised that at least since 1957 it has been the unexceptional rule that these Departments apply in all cases that bonafide newsman representing the established news media will be given authority on request to travel on these areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.309" offset="328600">Prior to 1957, that was the rule as to all areas other than Communist China.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.009" offset="355453">And as far as Communist China is concerned, travel was almost completely restricted to that particular country.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.767" offset="414490">Returning just briefly to the question of the construction of the statute on his face, our contention, our view that Section 1185’s provision that a traveler departing the United States must do so with a valid passport includes in that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.832" offset="514696">The fact that the passport must be valid to the country for which he is going is based not merely on the fact that the Secretary has so said and has applied that rule as it were extraneously to a passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.727" offset="582301">We think that the destination of a traveler is really of the very essence of what a passport has historically has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.525" offset="621484">The fact is that, the historical function of the passport has this Court recognized just long ago was Ersytechqui vs. Darse in 9 Peters is, as the document addressed by the Government of the United States to the Government of far nations, advising them that the bearer is a citizen of the United States and requesting that he be granted courtesy and safe travel in that foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.482" offset="741334">If a passport is not valid and it’s so marked as being “Not Valid” to a particular country, it is in effect no communication to that country.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.788" offset="782503">It’s not the Secretary of the State addressing the responsible officials there.</text>

            <label>Mr. Justice Learned Hand</label>
            <text syncTime="197.254" offset="892426">I think the first area restriction was really imposed way back in 1915 or really 1914 with regard to -- at the outbreak of World War I when –</text>

            <label>Mr. Justice Learned Hand</label>
            <text syncTime="213.102" offset="955747">Well, I would like to develop may be more so on the succeeding case really the fact that there was a criminal penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.800" offset="990542">The problem so far is the administration of the statute is involved, Mr. Justice Fortas.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.007" offset="1011440">The other side of the fact that they were in effect two criminal statutes enacted both of which cover various forms of violation of area restriction.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="236.234" offset="1048325">Now, we’re dealing now on statute passed in 1952, is that right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="justice_learned_hand" startTime="241.794" stopTime="251.510">
            <label>Mr. Justice Learned Hand</label>
            <text syncTime="241.794" offset="1070582">Yes, but it is a substantial re-enactment of the statute passed first on 1918 and then in 1941, both dealing specifically with war time situation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="251.510" stopTime="292.913">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="251.510" offset="1109452">Well, in any of that, whether it’s back in 1915 or 1952, we have a situation here where they spend some -- I should think reasonable mind would have to use certainly one of them when – can seen that there’s an area of doubt about the criminal penalty that the authorization or criminal penalty in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.918" offset="1227003">I think we were told that in May of this year, a bill wasn’t reduced to remedy that petitions, that ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.736" offset="1262320">Is that the first bill that’s been introduced on the subject?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="justice_learned_hand" startTime="292.913" stopTime="306.808">
            <label>Mr. Justice Learned Hand</label>
            <text syncTime="292.913" offset="1275068">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.364" offset="1276844">There had been a substantial series of bills, the Travis Brief, the petitioners Brief in this case cites almost 30 which were introduced between the 85th Congress and this past Congress.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="306.808" stopTime="313.836">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="306.808" offset="1330552">Well, how would you characterize the reason why none of those has been passed?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="justice_learned_hand" startTime="313.836" stopTime="476.208">
            <label>Mr. Justice Learned Hand</label>
            <text syncTime="313.836" offset="1358764">I would say very likely the reason why is that, the Congress may be does not want to go further than existing legislation in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.659" offset="1398053">And I think also realistically of there are all sorts of statutes that enter into why a bill wasn’t passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.012" offset="1435460">I think this Court has said on many occasions that the fact that Congress doesn’t pass the bill is no indication of a legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.051" offset="1471613">But I do think, if it were true that the bills proposed did no more than the, we say the existing law, does then I think there would be substance to petitioner’s argument that the proposal of those bills was an indication that the Departments involved believed that that existing legislation didn’t cover this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.861" offset="1570774">But the fact is, Mr. Justice Fortas, that the proposed bills do substantially more than existing law does.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.278" offset="1600449">Under existing law there were two criminal statutes involved, One is 18 USC 1544 which makes it a crime to use a passport in violation of its conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.414" offset="1640991">And that was enacted in 1917; the second criminal statute involve is the statute involved here, Section 1185.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.255" offset="1680384">What those two statutes require is proof under 1544 of use of the passport which is generally not true in cases of travel to countries which we have no diplomatic relations because in the passports it’s not just used in order to enter that country.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.563" offset="1753631">And what this statute require, the present statute, 1185, is proof of an intent to go to that country at the time of departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.959" offset="1787173">Now, a petitioner contend that the fact that they’ve been close to 600 violations of area restrictions prior to the bringing of these prosecutions indicates that the Department of State did not believe or the Department of State in Justice did not believe that this was a criminal statute that was applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.731" offset="1866271">But the fact is, this statute applies to a very few cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.132" offset="1879855">It applies only to cases where we can prove intent as of the time of departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.907" offset="1898977">Now, that’s very difficult when you’re dealing with travel, let’s say to Communist China.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.666" offset="1917994">We can’t prove that the man, who travels to Communist China, was ordinarily has that intent at the time he departs the United States and because of the problems of proof, both in this statute and in 18 USC 1544 that this amending legislation has been proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.936" offset="1987166">All these, I think all the bills which are listed in Mr. Travis Brief.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="497.062" offset="2091656">What I am asking about is, why that being so evident, so palpable at least it seems to me, the Government of the United States, States Department of -- Department of Justice have more than jointly having gone the Congress with the simple bill to try to ascertain what Congress really thinks about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.660" offset="2186010">I mean, what they really want to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.741" offset="2198340">Because as a matter and, I’ll stand, you are asking the Court really to – in fact this is not a statement – be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.109" offset="2243793">The Government, the Department of the Government because of the powerful ambiguity to say the least in the statute and when we’re dealing in the area of criminal jurisprudence.</text>

            <text syncTime="556.470" offset="2329266">Just to answer the first portion of your question, Mr. Chief Justice Fortas, we have gone the Congress and the statute which Mr. McTurn cited in response to Mr. Justice Harlan question was the latest proposal at the Department of State recommended.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.283" offset="2388511">Now what that statute does, which the existing laws do not, is that it simply makes it a crime to enter an area where to which travel is restricted.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.203" offset="2428217">But we think, although its true that the status in its face is not as clear as it might be, we think that passports have, for substantial period of time, been advising those that bear it and those to whom it’s issued that they are not valid for certain destinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.605" offset="2517765">And, the passports have in fact been referring prior to that Cuba Regulations of 1961 to this other statute, 18 USC 1544.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.532" offset="2561546">Because when dealing with countries that are far really from the United States as Communist China and some of the others to which travel was restricted, I think it could very reasonably, been supposed that it would be almost impossible to prove the intent which is required under Section 1185.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.289" offset="2636570">Now, the statutes have -- the passport statute have since 1941 borne the legend on the last page that “anyone who attempts to use the passport in violations of the conditions or restrictions contained therein, may have the protection of the United States withdrawn from him while they continues to reside abroad and they be liable for prosecution under the provisions of Section 221” entitled “22 United States Code” which is 18 USC 1544”.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.728" offset="2782333">In other words, the Department of State was never suggesting, as petitioners are arguing, that this was merely enforceable by a civil remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.458" offset="2817233">In other words, that we will just be removing protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.046" offset="2827577">It was entirely clear that people who would be bearing passports and if they violated the conditions or restrictions, there would be a criminal statute that would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.093" offset="2859760">Prior to 1961, it is true the passport did not explicitly refer to this criminal statute but it did refer to 18 USC 1544.</text>

            <text syncTime="1439.707" offset="5862170">Mr. Justice Harlan asked me yesterday why the stipulation was opaque with reference to what the petitioner possess at the time she departed the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.312" offset="5908668">I told him that I couldn’t go beyond the record at that point, convince him the Government has gone beyond the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.276" offset="5928521">I would like to make this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.677" offset="5938030">At the time that stipulation was negotiated, Mr. Justice Harlan and members of the Court, the United States Attorney and I agreed that the standard of criminality to be applied in this case was whether or not the petitioner held a valid passport specifically indorsed for travel to Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.727" offset="6018278">Having agreed upon that standard, we incorporated the language which you referred to as opaque and which we thought at the time was quite lucid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.088" offset="6055685">It was on that theory that the Court based that the case was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.826" offset="6070627">It was on that theory that the case was affirmed on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.955" offset="6099153">And, I submit that it’s a theory upon which this case was preceded from the very beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.623" offset="6125902">If I may add that simply one more thing as reference to that legend in the passport concerning Section 1544, that Section has never been invoked in the case of alleged violations of area restrictions and it was not referred to by the Department in its considered reply to Senator Full Bright in 1957, that one which you referred earlier Mr. Chief Justice, that Section so far as I know has never been considered as having any application to Geographic restriction.</text>
