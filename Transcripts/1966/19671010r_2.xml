            <label>Mr. Jacob D. Zeldes</label>
            <text syncTime="69.933" offset="383143">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.861" offset="398817">This case comes before the court for the second time with additional questions having been propounded by the court last term after argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.287" offset="444479">Considering the responses of the Government to those questions and setting to one side some of the finer refinements of the issues in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.099" offset="487737">The central crucial issue In this case is whether this petitioner can be fined thousand dollars and sent to prison for a year for failing to answer the following questions in connection with the wagering tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.932" offset="563075">Among those questions are; are you engaged in business of accepting wagers on your own account and do you receive wagers for or on behalf of other person or persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.494" offset="629321">To put the wagering tax laws in context and to understand the group upon which this laws call for such responses, I thought it might be appropriate to consider seven groups in the general gambling community.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.740" offset="702360">In the first group, if Your Honors please, might be the sweepstakes operators such as the New Hampshire Sweepstakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.249" offset="740394">In the second circumstance, set of circumstances might be the Casino operators of Las Vegas of which we are all familiar with, the Posh Casinos and the games of roulette, craps, Stud Poker, Black Jack, Bingo, what have you?</text>
            <text syncTime="176.910" offset="811029">In the third group, we could place the parimutuel operators at the large race tracks throughout the eastern sea board.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.410" offset="849063">And then in another group what I call the fourth group might be the Bingo group, numerous small games of this quality throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.419" offset="897024">In the fifth group we could have Church lotteries and raffles and in the sixth group, the friendly pool on the world series in the office of a large law firm or any other office which is so common throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.622" offset="965883">The seventh and last group might include the bookmaker and the pool selling operator and it is that seventh group only if this Court please, upon which the wagering tax laws operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.159" offset="1048012">I think if there's one though I'd like to leave with the court today, it would that I would like to dispel the notion that gambling is gradually becoming legalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.848" offset="1102764">In Las Vegas we have legalized gambling and we have sweepstakes and we have bingo, we have various forms of gambling that's generally becoming a neutral activity.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="262.450" stopTime="263.798">
            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="262.450" offset="1153128">Becoming a what?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jacob_d_zeldes" startTime="263.798" stopTime="884.103">
            <label>Mr. Jacob D. Zeldes</label>
            <text syncTime="263.798" offset="1158562">A neutral non-criminal activity mixed with the -- neutral used in the sense of the Albertson case, if Your Honor please.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.293" offset="1192521">I think that's the notion that I would like to dispel because this case operates and the taxes imposed by this case operate only on the seventh group that I mentioned, the illegal -- essentially on the seventh group I mentioned, the illegal bookmaker activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.790" offset="1266500">The Act by special definition excludes the sweepstakes and also excludes parimutuel betting and it also excludes the gambling casinos of Las Vegas not specifically but that type of gambling activity by the manner in which way during is defined in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.882" offset="1362944">If you're dealing with an activity where the contestants play in the presence of each other and all the winners are determined in the presence of each other such as roulette, or craps at one the casinos, that activity is specifically defined out of the way during tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.350" offset="1444760">So I think then we have a situation clearly within this Courts pronouncement in the Albertson case that where -- have a tax directed to a group which is primarily involved in criminal activity and which is inherently criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.884" offset="1526888">I think the notion that I would like to dispel is that its not.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.107" offset="1547786">As I said before, it's not an activity where there's mostly illegal activity and that we can't let the states bin this label of illegality to this conduct so as to thwart the revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.387" offset="1612884">Now, of course we would consider the group upon which the tax works.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.666" offset="1646007">It's important and necessary to consider how the tax actually functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.073" offset="1679653">Under the leading Section of the Act which is more directly involved in the next case that Professor Rightful discussed, there's a 10% tax on wagers as I've defined it to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.572" offset="1737644">Then, there must be a $50 stamp purchased under Section 4411 and in conjunction with that stamp a detailed questionnaire must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.127" offset="1795845">As I started to point out a moment ago that questionnaire is in Form 11-C which is annexed to my supplemental brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.868" offset="1834820">It asked for the taxpayer's full name, all aliases, business address, residence address, the name of all of the taxpayer's principals, the name of all the taxpayers' employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.223" offset="1896260">And it requires that this information must be filed at the time the $50 wagering tax stamp is purchased.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.538" offset="1941504">A collateral section in the Act makes it mandatory for the person engaged in this activity to keep track, keep a record of every single wage that he makes and then Section 4423 of the code makes it clear that this records which have been kept by every wager can be inspected at the desire of the Internal Revenue Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.533" offset="2045471">Rounding up the statutory scheme, Your Honors please, there are provisions which say specifically that payment of this tax does not excuse the taxpayer from any violation of state law or federal law and it also specifically provides that the petitioner in this case, if we would have bought the tax, would have had under the mandatory provisions of the Act, his name and address listed publicly and available for state prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.982" offset="2183293">I think it's interesting to note that Congress specifically put in that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.935" offset="2203146">I'm speaking of Section 6107 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.168" offset="2224044">That for a certain some state prosecutors can have some certified copies of this information that's been filed in connection with the wagering tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.554" offset="2261556">In addition to that, once the stamp has been purchased, the taxpayer must display it prominently on his premises and in conjunction with that point, I think it is important to note that if he forgets in a non-willful manner to display this there's also a punishment even if it's just negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.954" offset="2371166">With this group that I mentioned upon whom the tax works and the what and wherefore of the tax explained, it seems that once it is recognized the nature of the underlying gambling activity in this country, that the self-incriminatory aspects of the tax as applied are fairly obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.087" offset="2475760">Gambling of course and this is conceded by the Government is illegal every place in the United States except in Nevada, with exceptions to the specific things that I've mentioned most of which are excluded from operation of the way during tax laws and since this issue was originally resolved some fifteen years ago in the Kahriger case over dissent and the Lewis case also over dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.418" offset="2585057">The Federal Government has gotten into the picture considerably more.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.513" offset="2601462">I have set forth in our supplemental brief a list of the various federal laws at page 7 that the United States now comes in -- come into play on behalf of the United States although there -- some of these weren't effect at the time the court first considered the wagering tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.445" offset="2685158">There have been additional statutes added.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.435" offset="2705115">So considering first the group that I've referred to and then considering the how of the act, how it operates and the nature of the activity, it seems to me that we can rely with some confidence on this Courts pronounced, unanimous announcement on the Albertson case that when the activity is essentially permeated, the criminal conduct, there is a purpose by which the self-incrimination clause can be utilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.240" offset="2820368">And I think Malloy also comes into the picture at this point because Malloy versus Hogan decided after Kahriger and after Lewis established also that the test to use is whether or not it can possibly result in crim -- in incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.726" offset="2898317">And I think if you measure the framework, measure the context, I think the opposite result follows that in the context of this Act there cannot be anything but incrimination by the payment of the wagering tax law -- stamp.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.044" offset="2979506">After the case was here last term, the court as I mentioned set it down for reargument and directed counsel to brief two additional questions which I'll discuss in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.370" offset="3044812">I should perhaps point out that the Fifth Amendment argument upon which we rely today was considered and rejected by the District Court without opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.229" offset="3092250">The District Court ruling was prior to this Court's decision in Albertson versus Subversive Activities Control Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.435" offset="3125164">The Court of Appeals in an opinion written by Judge Friendly of the Second Circuit considered the issue prior to the rendition of the Albertson case and Albertson came down I think about fourteen days after the Second Circuit acted and we promptly move for reargument.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.989" offset="3199352">In that motion for reargument the response of Judge Friendly was that Albertson very well may lead this Court to reconsider its rulings in Kahriger and Lewis but it felt that any change in the situation should come from this Court and not from the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.973" offset="3271241">Subsequent to that this Court granted certiorari in a companion case entitled the United States versus Costello.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.680" offset="3314082">Costello died before the matter was heard and certiorari was granted in the present case, in the Marchetti case.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.394" offset="3352952">In this connection I should perhaps point out what its pointed out in the briefs that we are here on the Costello record but that Costello and Marchetti were codefendants in the District Court and that the record was similar and there's no factual dispute on the record, it's purely a matter of the Fifth Amendment applied to the wagering tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.966" offset="3455248">As to the two additional questions, if Your Honors please, which was propounded by the court last term, one is whether or not the required records doctrine of Shapiro as any application to this case and the other, if Your Honors please, is whether or not the registration requirement of Section 4412 which is related to Form 11-C that I quoted before can be met without -- I'm sorry, whether the tax provision of 4411 can be met without the registration provision being complied with.</text>

            <text syncTime="886.502" offset="3649390">It was directed in my case also if Your Honor please and the Government originally had concede that it -- that they could not be isolated in our case and they had modified their position in Grosso to say this comment, it also cannot be paid without compliance with the registration in the Grosso case.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.071" offset="3727653">As to the required records doctrine and as to the additional question concerning the payment, if the Court please, the Government and petitioner essentially in agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.662" offset="3774046">I think perhaps the best summary of the Government's position is contained in the original brief at page 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.137" offset="3815946">The Government stated there is no need for the court presently to consider any possible relationship between the privilege against self-incrimination and the so-called required records doctrine in Shapiro versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.997" offset="3887313">No such issue is involved on the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.487" offset="3909360">The Government reaffirmed that in their brief on reargument although they had a slight modification and attempted to draw some support from what I might call the spirit of Shapiro rather than Shapiro itself as to justifying this Courts earlier decision in Kahriger and Lewis.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.902" offset="3999013">On the second point, here again the parties are in complete accord.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.579" offset="4017716">The Government concedes forthrightly that the tax, the $50 stamp cannot be purchased without registering, without giving the name and address of your business, without giving the names and address of all your employees or your principals, and without an effect confessing to whether or you're engaged in the business of gambling, either for yourself or in behalf of someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.062" offset="4127640">I think this point was clearly called for by the decisions of the lower court particularly the Third Circuit decision where a taxpayer had attempted to pay the tax and not register and that was held in his case not to be a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.496" offset="4197334">Moreover, the registration provisions specifically provide that in Section 4412 that the registration shall be made and there are correlative regulations issued by the Commissioner of the Treasury Department which this Court -- support that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.528" offset="4273507">Here again, if Your Honors please, I think we're clearly within -- what the court said in the Albertson case, there is nothing here which permits less than literal and full compliance with the registration requirements and the form that is required to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.515" offset="4353442">The Government, although admitting as I have said that the registration must be completed repeatedly characterizes this information which I've just discussed has minimal, I'm not so particularly with the label minimal or maximal but I think that as a label in this context considering the nature of the underlying activity involved, this can hardly be considered minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.502" offset="4477367">In Connecticut for example, it is a violation of our law to frequent a place which has the reputation for being a gambling hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.557" offset="4521566">There are many, many statutes where the information contained in this registration would be a virtual confession to violation of state law and perhaps it's substantially to a conviction of federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1130.184" offset="4624071">We have to have this information, how can you collect the tax, how can you collect the tax if you don't know where the taxpayer lives, if you don't what this business is, that type of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.404" offset="4665031">I should point out, if Your Honor please, the Government argues in their opening brief and I think this is important in connection with their repeated assertions if they're only looking for minimal information in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.626" offset="4721873">The Government points out in their opening brief disclosures often highly detailed and this is page 13 of their opening brief, are required under federal law of those who chose -- choose to engage in many occupations and then they list 15 U.S.C. involving disclosures from the Investment bankers and then they list disclosures required of radio stations and then they list disclosures from air carriers, then they list disclosures from motor carriers, then they list disclosures from lobbyist and there they list -- and then they also list disclosures from stockyard dealers, market agencies and officers and employees of labor union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.859" offset="4934823">But if Your Honor please, and I think this is where Albertson play such a big role.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.524" offset="4953422">To test to measure those disclosures, not give the label minimal or maximal against the underlying activity to which they relay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.474" offset="4993233">Where in Connecticut, I'm sorry, where in this country is it to be an illegal to be an investment adviser?</text>

            <text syncTime="1241.105" offset="5067839">It seems to me that that question which the court so emphasized in Albertson dispels the notion of minimum disclosure that the Government urges in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.978" offset="5119248">In fact, in the examples that they've cite in their brief that I've just referred to there is no suggestion of illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.577" offset="5145684">But in our case, in the case before the court today the entire area is permeated in the criminal activity as the term is used in the Albertson case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1323.031" offset="5395519">The possession of narcotics is essentially illegal throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.797" offset="5414536">And it would depend I think precisely on the nature of the disclosures required by the various Acts to what extent they are.</text>

            <text syncTime="1392.281" offset="5672521">Now if you're opposing a new statute which could be affected so as no information is required that would tend to incriminate then we say that doesn't run or follow the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.964" offset="5727274">I think one thing that might be worth emphasizing at this point in response to you, Mr. Chief Justice, is the limited scope of the grant of certiorari in this very case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.734" offset="5778265">I presented to the court in my petition for certiorari a Tenth Amendment argument and I think that you can argue forcefully as some of the dissenters did in Kahriger that the Congress was merely attempting to regulate state activity here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.452" offset="5829151">But I'm setting that to one side, I don't ask this Court to rely on that argument at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.521" offset="5849422">I realized that the only issue before the court is whether or not there can be compliance with this tax without running the risk of violating the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.023" offset="5899473">And the way that tax is now framed, if Your Honors please, I think that the answer is clear under Albertson that violation of the Fifth Amendment cannot be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.653" offset="5945971">Now if we say, can Congress in any way tax this activity so it doesn't violate the Fifth Amendment, I say yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.121" offset="5979826">The Congress hasn't elected to do that at this stage, if they very well might, if we prevail in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.832" offset="6006680">That Congress might grant immunity as they've done in some many, many instances and as a catalogue in some of the briefs in the companion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.678" offset="6042102">Or if there could conceivably be a way that could be fashioned for the anonymous payment of this tax then perhaps it could be paid without violating the Fifth Amendment but I think under the present structure, by the mere fact for example, that if I buy a stamp I must display it publicly on my premises or face a penalty even if I negligently fail to do it and non-willfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.964" offset="6091212">I think under these circumstances there can be no compliance with the statute without violating the Fifth Amendment and that's the basis of our claim and I think where we have most of the quarrel with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.979" offset="6199254">The Government says to us you really saying you can tax gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.983" offset="6215346">And our response to that, Mr. Chief Justice, is that's not our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.818" offset="6230601">If the Congress wants to tax gambling, it may or may not have power, that question is not before the court right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.996" offset="6259336">I'm sure that 1951 when this was passed, Congress felt it didn't have the power to reach gambling because of the scope of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.624" offset="6293817">They may now feel that they can directly outlaw gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.022" offset="6307506">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.156" offset="6311999">But the point I want to emphasize is we are not maintaining that this cannot be taxed as the Government says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.958" offset="6343241">We would concede arguendo for the purposes of this scope of this grant of certiorari that this activity can be taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.007" offset="6375424">But what can't happen is what was summarized so nicely in the (Inaudible) Journal comment that came out after this case was argued last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.203" offset="6408234">What can happen is this tax cannot be administered so as to violate petitioner's privilege against self-incrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2316.752" offset="9370415">I think I understand your question Mr. Justice Fortas and my response is as follows: I do not believe that acceptance of our position here requires the invalidation of the hypothetical situation which you posed in connection with the maintaining of records in connection with the income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.864" offset="9446797">And I think and I go back again, I think that it relates to the total context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.577" offset="9465710">Income, the constant generation of income in this country is essentially a neutral non-criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.228" offset="9500296">One person, perhaps the petitioner in this case may participate in certain illegal activity and he may have a right to claim his individual privilege against self adminis -- self-incrimination at the appropriate time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.979" offset="9555257">But it does not require the invalidation of the record keeping provision directed to the country at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.398" offset="9589008">But in our particular case, that Congress has singled out almost exclusively not even all kinds of gambling because they have let out the church gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.593" offset="9633729">They've let out the Las Vegas gambling, almost exclusively, illegal gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.716" offset="9654209">And I say almost exclusively because the tax does apply to the Las Vegas bookie and it does apply to the Las Vegas policy operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.426" offset="9689109">But because of the peculiar regulations, some of which I referred to in my brief, they're pretty much an insignificant aspect to the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.039" offset="9723486">In Las Vegas for example, a bookmaker can't be in a casino.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.452" offset="9737174">Bookmaking must be isolated from the general gambling activity under the Nevada regulations.A bookmaker in Nevada must pass the federal tax to the customer and that's permissible with the federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.098" offset="9799764">But if a non-Nevada bookmaker passes the tax along, he must give the name and address of his customer to the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.797" offset="9838529">Well, when that occurs in any one of the other fifty states besides Nevada that immediately places the customer in jeopardy of violating the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.399" offset="9880952">Such is not the case in Nevada because it's legal to bet with Nevada bookmakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.066" offset="9899656">So I think the central core of the case rest pretty much with that distinction, if Your Honor please, and I think the peculiar wording in the grant of certiorari in this case indicates that distinction because the question is not just, should Kahriger and Lewis be overturned but should Kahriger and Lewis be overturned in the light of Albertson.</text>

            <text syncTime="2613.451" offset="10557210">I think and I believe I have responded to Mr. Justice Fortas' inquiry just before the recess and I think there is one statement in the Government's brief that perhaps summarize this, it's an example, summarizes where we feel they're taking us to somewhat faulty approach to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.504" offset="10633383">It's actually filed in the Government's Grosso brief at page fifteen, these are companion cases and the Government asked this Court, is a person free to assert the privilege to justify a failure to pay a tax on his residential property or to file a property tax return calling for his address?</text>

            <text syncTime="3570.322" offset="14384671">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.776" offset="14410480">One of the points made by Mr. Zeldes that I'd like to address myself to first is that his position doesn't impinge upon the Congressional power to tax at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.237" offset="14468368">I think that's fallacious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.651" offset="14477981">He suggests several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.733" offset="14490311">He says, one, Congress can still tax but what it can't do is require the disclosure of information that might be used against a particular person charged with the payment of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.448" offset="14553213">And he says that, “Well, Congress might enact an immunity statute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.892" offset="14574947">What seems to me that you -- we get to that only if there is a Fifth Amendment problem and you would have to say that Congress at least can't tax the way it has taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.688" offset="14618102">He says also that, “Well, you can pay the tax anonymously.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.317" offset="14648613">Our position is that a tax that has to be paid in such a strange and unique manner in which the taxpayer doesn't identify himself, give his address just isn't administrable as a practical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.837" offset="14730742">Both Mr. Zeldes and Professor Wright say over and over again that there's no problem here with Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.747" offset="14766373">We agree that Sullivan is distinguishable, it's different, the court pointed out in Albertson a rationale in which Sullivan differed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.697" offset="14806183">But it's not quite all that easy in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.565" offset="14825618">It seems to me that if we talk about the Fifth Amendment as protecting a person for many link or lead that could be used against him and it's very difficult to conclude that a taxpayer filing an income tax return in which he refuses to disclose the source on the grounds of the Fifth Amendment hasn't provided some link or some lead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.213" offset="14928227">Now the court has been willing to accept Sullivan rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.894" offset="14946931">It did so in Albertson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.253" offset="14956335">We think that that distinction is of sound -- but that raises all the problems that Mr. Justice Fortas and Mr. Justice White have been talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.824" offset="14998653">And it raises in our mind the question of whether the position put forward here in effect, the tax -- Congress can't tax in the way it has is of sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.748" offset="15058317">One of the things that was thrown out here was the point that the wageing tax only operates on essentially illegal activity is except in Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.838" offset="15098755">Well, the Senate Committee Report explains why bingo games and parimutuel betting and whatever are excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.056" offset="15127594">It seems to me it's pretty sensible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.062" offset="15135640">They say that the committee has excluded the above types of gambling not because of any belief but they are not suitable subjects for taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.493" offset="15165315">However, the method of taxation provided while particularly appropriate to bookmaking and the policy operations does not appear readily adoptable to these other forms of gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.387" offset="15204916">And then with respect to parimutuel wagering they say it doesn't apply there because such wagering is presently subject to substantial state and in some instances local taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.892" offset="15250892">And to superimpose a federal tax upon these transactions would only serve to maintain the existing advantage which bookmakers enjoy over parimutuel betting by reason of their immunity on parimutuel taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.981" offset="15307316">So it seems to us that the question really is whether Congress can put an excise tax on gamblers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.310" offset="15344619">We have taken the position throughout that Congress can do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.854" offset="15370742">We think that Kahriger and Lewis provide a sensible accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.299" offset="15392580">And the word accommodation as it seems to me is the one to be shy away from.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.525" offset="15405432">It's the term the court used in Murphy, said that the rule that they adopted there was one that would accommodate state and the federal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.866" offset="15446810">It seems to me that that's been the consistent approach of at least the majority of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.318" offset="15468648">The Fifth Amendment is consistently accommodated with other powers that exist in the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.057" offset="15495607">It does not exist in the abstract, it exist in the same constitution that has the power to tax and power to do other thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="4132.573" offset="16633710">Kahriger and Lewis have been regarded by many as being grounded on the consideration that the registration requirement involved in both those cases was simply prospective in operation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4189.907" offset="16862960">It seems to us that that's a sensible rationale but we realized that the court wouldn't have taken these cases to reconsider Kahriger and Lewis in light of Albertson.</text>

            <text syncTime="5031.802" offset="20230562">We conclude that in order to implement this rule and accommodate the interest of the State and Federal Governments, the Federal Government must be prohibited to make any such use of compelled testimony and its fruits.</text>
            <text syncTime="5044.841" offset="20282702">There are other cases in which the court has referred to the restriction on use, in the Blue case the court said even if we assume the Government did in -- did acquire incriminating evidence in violation of the Fifth Amendment, Blue would at most be entitled to suppress the evidence and its fruits if they were sought to be used against him at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5067.522" offset="20373504">There's a similar statement in Adams versus Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="5074.635" offset="20401925">It seems to us that that they sought a rule if the court feels that Kahriger and Lewis are not consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5081.554" offset="20429615">Fifth Amendment as presently understood would provide a sensible accommodation not only in these cases but in the other cases in which Albertson may have some difficulty in the future implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="5096.710" offset="20490219">Your alternative is if this (Inaudible) Congress can't put an excise tax on gambling unless it immunizes these gamblers from any possible incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5110.833" offset="20546748">And I don't know why in the face of Murphy it's not appropriate for the court to adopt or use the restriction rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="5119.320" offset="20580603">We developed at length that seems to us that that -- that is a sound and a sensible position.</text>
            <text syncTime="5126.566" offset="20609651">I would like for a few moments, since this is on reargument to discuss the questions that the court posed and asked to have dscussed in our briefs and oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5143.753" offset="20678405">We take the position as Mr. Zeldes has pointed out that in our view the Shapiro case is not of direct relevance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5155.627" offset="20725844">As we read and understand Shapiro it relates to the so-called required records doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5164.564" offset="20761579">A requirement that certain records be maintained and kept and be available for inspection by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.450" offset="20797210">And we think that's a different situation from one in which the Government requires and individual to affirmatively come forth and make reports or returns to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5187.853" offset="20854784">It seems to us that Shapiro has it is evolved over the years as understood and to mean in the context in which it arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="5198.515" offset="20897416">The court pointed out in Shapiro that the regulation there involved records that were customarily and regularly kept.</text>
            <text syncTime="5206.536" offset="20929494">It seems to us that that's an appropriate improper view of Shapiro.</text>
            <text syncTime="5213.212" offset="20956244">The alternative of saying that Shapiro is applicable any time the Government requires anything to be filed with the -- it seems to us, the lack of any sensible limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5225.601" offset="21005772">We therefore don't argue that, is that reliable?</text>
            <text syncTime="5229.150" offset="21019982">Now there is a potential Shapiro problem with respect to the wagering tax as we point out, there's a Section of the wagering tax statute, Section 4403 that provides for the keeping of daily records of the wagering activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5246.871" offset="21090826">That statute is not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5251.393" offset="21108903">Now the courts below in this or in the Grosso case considered 4403 and petitioners were not charged with failing to keep such records nor were any records of either of the petitioners along those lines and produced against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5270.972" offset="21187271">There may be an appropriate case in which this question comes out in which the application of Shapiro is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5277.872" offset="21214856">It's not this case and it seems to us that there's no need presently to get to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5284.320" offset="21240665">The other question involves the inquiry as to what sort of information must be provided accompanying payment of the excise tax in the Grosso case and order to affect registration and the correlative payment of special occupational tax in the Marchetti case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5314.056" offset="21359574">We take the position that the forms that are prescribed for use, Form 11-C as to registration, Form 730 is the excise tax must be completed and filed along with payment and registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5336.229" offset="21448286">It seems to us that in order for a tax scheme to operate in a sensible way, certain information has to be obtained by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5346.694" offset="21490186">The business of an anonymous payment, it seems to us not to be a feasible one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5354.238" offset="21520280">Now, underlying the problem here, Mr. Zeldes didn't speak to it directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5362.652" offset="21554030">Mr. Justice Stewart referred to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5364.856" offset="21562807">The problem is that almost anything you require someone to do, if you require him to put his name down on the thing, they are going to claim that that's enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="5376.722" offset="21610245">Mr. Chief Justice you tried to develop this this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="5380.857" offset="21626755">It seems to me that's the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5382.637" offset="21633964">If the root -- the answer is, well no we can't even be required to put our name on the form because if we put our name on the form they may come about knowledge of us that they wouldn't have otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="5395.673" offset="21686105">Well, I don't know how else you administer a tax scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.872" offset="21710869">Our position is that if we can at least have the people that are required to pay the tax identify them then the tax scheme is not workable or feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5414.125" offset="21759875">Therefore that's the reason why we take the position we do as to the second set of inquiries that the court has posed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5430.084" offset="21823718">Several other points were raised during prior argument that I'd like to mention, it seems to me that the question is posed as to the applicability of Shapiro in the income tax context is a difficult one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5452.865" offset="21914833">I don't think it's raised here either.</text>
            <text syncTime="5455.857" offset="21926849">I think its proper if the court considers the implications of Fifth Amendment decisions in the East cases, in subsequent case that are going to come along.</text>
            <text syncTime="5466.304" offset="21968541">We tried to develop in our reargument brief to point that the -- despite the claims that you don't have to worry about Sullivan and not to worry about the income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="5478.585" offset="22017755">In a term or two, if Kahriger and Lewis are not followed, these cases are going to be out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5487.544" offset="22053595">Now, one answer is well, deal with them when they come.</text>
            <text syncTime="5491.585" offset="22069687">It seems to us that Albertson and its reading of the Fifth Amendment opens up this whole array of problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="5505.423" offset="22125066">With respect to Mr. Justice Fortas' inquiry about Shapiro and the records that are required to be kept, I think I would give substantially the same answers as Mr. Zeldes' gave.</text>
            <text syncTime="5519.491" offset="22181386">It may be that as to certain people that are required to keep records incident to the income tax laws, they would have a privilege but its quite clear then either that Shapiro doesn't stand for its brought a proposition to some people, I think it does or if the court in taking that position would be effectively restricting in limiting Shapiro.</text>
            <text syncTime="5549.243" offset="22300296">Now, we don't rely on Shapiro affirmatively here but we do point out that the court was faced with a similar problem in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5557.375" offset="22332897">I know it's an old case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5560.395" offset="22344913">But the problem there was that the Government had a program that required people to keep certain things as records.</text>
            <text syncTime="5569.094" offset="22379708">The question was whether those records had the kind of character that they could be used by the Government in a prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5581.092" offset="22427773">And the court concluded that they could, concluded that they could because those records had certain public aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="5589.228" offset="22460270">Now, as I have said previously it seems to us that one way to consider Shapiro in light of the background of that case is that the records of the court there was talking about are those records that are ordinarily and customarily kept.</text>
            <text syncTime="5606.082" offset="22527666">But I don't know that the answers the problem that Mr. Justice Fortas read.</text>
            <text syncTime="5611.497" offset="22549400">It seems to me that most taxpayers keep certain records whether the activity they engaged in is lawful or unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="5621.249" offset="22588374">And the problem of course that you're faced with then is whether Shapiro provides that these kinds of records regardless of the framework of the activity are within or without the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="5636.699" offset="22650128">It seems to us that rather than anticipate an answer to that the better course is to keep in mind these difficulties in resolving the problem here because there isn't or there isn't any need to resolve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5654.756" offset="22722435">They are -- they're in the background and they're going to present themselves eventually.</text>

            <text syncTime="5679.648" offset="22822013">Well, Shapiro of course permitted the use of a criminal prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="6458.637" offset="25937899">Just for few moments, I'd like to talk about the dispositions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6465.093" offset="25963708">It seems to us that if the Kahriger and Lewis rationale, the non-compulsion voluntary choice rationale is accepted that the affirmance is as dictated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6480.717" offset="26026193">And we recognized however that more difficult problems presented if the court should adopt the Murphy type exclusionary rule approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="6492.046" offset="26071542">We recognized that in Murphy the court reversed the civil content convictions there on the ground that the individual should be given another opportunity to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="6504.143" offset="26119920">We think however that our circumstances here are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="6507.474" offset="26133295">And that they do not necessarily warrant a remand or reversal if a use restriction approach was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6518.432" offset="26177076">The petitioners in these cases knew about Kahriger and Lewis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6524.711" offset="26202258">That they knew that the statute had been upheld as a constitutional exercise of the tax posed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6531.055" offset="26227545">It seems to us that a further holding that a statute is valid doesn't justify there activity or their conduct on failing to pay the tax or register.</text>
            <text syncTime="6542.712" offset="26274252">Now, a situation such as in the James case, it seems to us is a different one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6548.063" offset="26295672">In James there was clear authority to the contrary prior to the court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6553.766" offset="26318451">Here we don't have that kind of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6557.282" offset="26332453">Indeed, the petitioner Marchetti in one question admitted that he knew about the wagering tax law but he said that nobody buys the stamps and the he pays enough already.</text>
            <text syncTime="6572.027" offset="26391489">Petitioner Grosso in the next case, his defense was that he had gotten out of the wagering business when the wagering tax laws were enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6582.672" offset="26434017">He didn't want to mess around with feds so he got out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6587.017" offset="26451466">Well, that defense was rejected by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="6590.438" offset="26465155">So both of these petitioners knew what the law was and what the law required and they didn't comply with.</text>
            <text syncTime="6596.740" offset="26490337">It seems to us that under those circumstances they were properly convicted and if the court adopts either of the rationales the Government suggests, their conviction should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="6619.904" offset="26583019">I would just like to comment very briefly on the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="6625.952" offset="26607156">I didn't comment in my opening remarks on the use restriction alternative suggestion that the Government makes and I won't dwell on it in depth now.</text>
            <text syncTime="6637.104" offset="26651773">I had set out fairly and comprehensively in all of our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="6640.824" offset="26666715">But I would like to make one mention of the comment of Mr. Justice Harlan regarding Section 6107.</text>
            <text syncTime="6648.836" offset="26698689">I think that's very informative on the Government's alternative argument because the Government admits in effect that that Section stands in the way of their alternative argument that they argued to the court, well, until we can get the Internal Revenue Service to get Congress to amend that we'll sort of ignore it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6669.740" offset="26782281">They can of course represent that they'll ignore a law of Congress but they'll -- it's very malleable on the Government's position and I think that the point that was raised in regard to Section 6107 demonstrate to some extent the inability of the use of the use restriction alternative argument that the Government advanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="6693.059" offset="26875591">The Government also made reference to fear of conjure circle which is the word used by Mr. Justice Holmes in the Sullivan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6701.751" offset="26910386">And I think as its reliance on that is based primarily on the statement Mr. Beytagh made immediately before that if I've heard him correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6712.446" offset="26953122">He said, “No one will really know if you had a proper privilege or not.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6717.585" offset="26973706">But that certainly is no problem in this area like in Albertson where the area is so saturated with criminal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="6725.727" offset="27006307">My only other remark before closing cause perhaps I thought I might shed a little bit of light on the situation that Mr. Justice White was talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="6736.142" offset="27047894">As I understand the situation I think there's no question if the income tax can be paid so as not to identify its source but and this very important for the large volume of voluntary compliance and the large amount of legal activity in this country in the income tax context.</text>
            <text syncTime="6754.729" offset="27122291">If taxpayer wants any deductions or if the taxpayer wants any exemptions, if he has eployees there must be disclosures regarding that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6764.412" offset="27161057">But if an illegal -- if a person involved in illegal activity pays the tax on his gross income and claims nothing, as I understand the procedure and as the Government concedes this can be done anonymously.</text>
