            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 42, Switzerland Cheese Association, Incorporated et al., petitioners versus E. Horne's Market, Incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.548" offset="225573">Mr. Toren.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Toren</label>
            <text syncTime="31.976" offset="231320">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.718" offset="254203">The issue before the Court is a jurisdictional one that has long vexed the Court of Appeals and has caused to deter the event.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.734" offset="302268">It reaches the Court on certiorari to the First Circuit and involves interpretation of that section of the judicial code which states and I quote, “the Courts of Appeal shall have jurisdiction of appeal from interlocutory orders of the District Court refusing injunction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="77.049" offset="411564">The question here is whether this language authorizes an appeal from an interlocutory order which refused a permanent injunction prayed for in a motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.286" offset="480528">The language of the statute is plain, simple and unconditional in authorizing appeals from refusals of injunction for all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.779" offset="538520">We therefore urge the Court to answer the Court in the affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.286" offset="572479">We do not prevent the issue as an abstract proposition but rather in the context of a cause in regard to which the refusal of the injunction has a far reaching and drastic effect on the business and rights of these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.746" offset="666311">Petitioners are the exclusive representatives of the cheese producing community of Switzerland which for many centuries has produced quality cheese which is famous for its excellence throughout the western world including the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.302" offset="760560">This cheese is generally and universally known outside Switzerland as Imported Swiss Cheese and has been marketed under this name by these petitioners for many decades in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.439" offset="849168">The respondent, a Boston cheese trader, sells as Imported Swiss Cheese an inferior, imitative, less expensive Swiss-type cheese product originating from Finland or Austria without informing the public that the cheese in fact comes from these countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.783" offset="962539">This conduct is infringement of our rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.472" offset="981243">It dilutes our trade name.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.103" offset="991796">It confuses the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.958" offset="1003186">It lessens the goodwill which has been built up for the trade name and the cheese and of course it causes financial loss to these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.228" offset="1052296">Accordingly, by way of summary judgment procedure, we move for a permanent injunction enjoining this respondent from using our trade name on non-Switzerland cheese, unless and that is important, the respondent at the same time indicates the country of origin of the cheese.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.593" offset="1157726">In other words, we are not asking for permanent injunction for all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.991" offset="1179355">What we want is that this respondent when he sells Imported Swiss Cheese, he should indicate where the cheese comes from.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.103" offset="1223764">The motion was denied without opinion by the District Court for the District of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.174" offset="1256051">We then appeal to the First Circuit pursuant to Section 1292 which as stated before authorizes appeals from interlocutory orders refusing injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.027" offset="1323447">When we answered the calendar call, last fall, the chief judge of the First Circuit, dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction and refused to hear oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.661" offset="1390007">This Court then granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.952" offset="1411218">In dismissing the appeal, the Court of Appeals of the First Circuit made the following statement which is if I may say the key sentence of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.627" offset="1453850">I quote, “Because of a general policy against piecemeal appeals, statutes permitting interlocutory appeals ought to be construed with some strict rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.122" offset="1515813">On this basis, whatever may be the exact letter the spirit of Section 1292 is against plaintiff's position.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="364.336" offset="1560743">Well, in reality, does this case involve anything more than the question as to whether this Court is going to review and perhaps overrule a decision of the United States District Court on a motion for summary judgment that the case is not right for summary disposition that there is a genuine issue, a fact which the Court wants to try out.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.724" offset="1678294">Is there anything more before us than that?</text>

            <text syncTime="396.144" offset="1687907">May it please, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.975" offset="1695222">The question which has been presented on certiorari is limited exactly to the proposition Your Honor just outlined.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.074" offset="1727718">Now, my learned friend here in his brief has urged the Court to dispose of the subject matter pursuant of the matter and should limit itself to the question --</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="418.036" offset="1775470">Well, I am not asking you that.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.437" offset="1781112">Let's forget about that aspect of it but I have difficulty to state quite frankly saying where this does involve a question under the statute governing interlocutory appeals in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.075" offset="1859688">It seems to me that this involves the quite familiar question, questions quite familiar to lawyers, a lot of lawyers anyway as to whether an order denying a motion for summary judgment is appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.923" offset="1935026">Well, presumably the United States District Court felt rightly or wrongly that there was a genuine issue of fact that was not satisfied to decide this case on the basis of the affidavits that had been submitted and the thought that the case should go to trial and that there should be a decision after a presentation of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.312" offset="2040665">Am I right in understanding that that is the situation?</text>

            <label>Mr. David Toren</label>
            <text syncTime="492.591" offset="2073788">The question involved here as far as we are concerned is a question of law to which in our original motion for summary judgment we raised a legal proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.738" offset="2126346">We said that an international convention for the protection of industrial property which is implemented in the Lanham Act, the trademark statute which prohibits unfair competition and deceptive misuse of famous trade name.</text>

            <text syncTime="2948.150" offset="11895933">I meant earlier in my argument to explain why I asked that the Court dismissed the case on the merits because there is authority and I refer to Patterson v. Alabama 294 U.S. 600 page 607.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.216" offset="11972211">We have frequently held that in the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction, we have power not only to correct error in the judgment under review but to make such disposition of the case as justice requires and the Court has on different occasions dismiss the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.063" offset="12047653">Well, of course we're anxious in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.449" offset="12061132">I would argue would be dismissed because all we're using is the word “imported” and we don't want to go on from court to court fighting for our rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.147" offset="12100002">In fact I better say this that this was a small sign and when the suit started the attorney for the defendant who isn't here told his client to take down the sign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.701" offset="12154128">The sign hasn't been up since then but what they want is an injunction and we aren't willing to have the injunction issue because you make use of an injunction naturally legally by advertising it so forth so that's where our difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.213" offset="12224240">We don't consider calling Imported Swiss Cheese, any great event while you're only selling only 15 to 20 pounds a week and actually we aren't doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.427" offset="12273037">Now, I depended also on a case not in my brief but Your Honors will recall on that Sears, Roebuck v. Stiffel 376 U.S. 225.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.879" offset="12338866">In that case, this Court made it clear that nothing was to be taken out of the public domain and given to anyone party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.401" offset="12389021">In that case, it happen to be a lamp that wasn't patented and they had gotten an injunction enjoining the defendant Sears Roebuck from using the lamp even though it was patented and this Court made it clear if there were no statutory protection for that lamp either by a design patent or regular patent or a copyright that anyone who's free to make it, in the same holds here as to the word imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.080" offset="12519737">Anyone is free to use the word imported if it's truthful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.073" offset="12543666">Now, the Code of Federal Regulation Title 21 Chapter 1 defines in Section 2 Swiss cheese.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.535" offset="12593507">I don't need to read the definition but in order for the import division, the treasury department to permit the entry of cheese they defined Swiss cheese and of course Swiss cheese it's coming from all these different countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.095" offset="12679711">Another thing I should mention the defendant respondent never uses Switzerland, he never called this cheese Switzerland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.686" offset="12718164">He never called his cheese genuine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.501" offset="12729344">All he calls it is imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.748" offset="12750346">Another thing during the hearing in fact the motion for summary judgment contain no proof or advertisement whatsoever that the plaintiff, petitioner here ever used the words imported Swiss cheese alone to describe its product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.630" offset="12829863">They presented no advertisement showing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.636" offset="12841880">All the advertisements described the product as Switzerland Swiss cheese.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.224" offset="12864240">Now, coming to the decision because while the Second Circuit Court of Appeals did permit an appeal from a denial of summary judgment I think the case of Morgenstern v. Schering 181 F.2d 160 from the Third Circuit is better reasoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.317" offset="12948668">On page 162 the Court said the denial of summary judgment in the court below has no comparable significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.253" offset="12980433">The Court has not reached much less decided the merits of plaintiff's claim for injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.128" offset="13003839">The motion for summary judgment is not an application for a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.155" offset="13024005">Nothing has occurred in or as a result of the denial of the motion which precludes plaintiff from seeking a temporary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.884" offset="13058905">Now, in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit where they did allow the appeal I think you will see the fallacy especially in Judge Frank's opinion where he said regarding the case of contrary conclusion by sheer ritualism would waste time for plaintiff the next minute after the denial of the summary judgment motion could present the same papers and changed except for a new label motion for a preliminary injunction.</text>
