            <label>Mr. Robert W. Ginnane</label>
            <text syncTime="11.855" offset="150758">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.938" offset="167163">Resuming, I would like to turn to the contention of some of the appellant railroads and the Department of Justice that consummation of a Penn-Central merger cannot as a matter of law be permitted until every small line, the orphans as the Solicitor General has referred to them are fitted into a larger rail system.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.382" offset="264861">The court below held and we submit correctly that this is not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.007" offset="287431">Of course it would be the ideal decisional situation, but it just doesn't happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.482" offset="313344">From 1920 until 1940, Congress had a state of -- stated objective, the consolidation of the nation's railroads and to what it characterized as a limited number of rail systems, and it authorized the Commission to approve carrier initiated proposals for unification which were consonant with this pre-determined plan which the Commission was to draw up.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.930" offset="443120">This Court recognized in its decisions in Schwabacher and in St. Joe Paper Company that the planned approach failed, and the principal reason it failed was that the Commission lacked power to initiate or to compel mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.101" offset="523786">Section 5 was complete -- completely rewritten in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.855" offset="546774">This Court has noted in the County of Marin case that the end of Congress, its objective remained the same, the only thing that changed was the means.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.599" offset="601736">Under the present Section 5, the only planning or coercive power which the Commission has is the power to condition its approval of a carrier initiated merger by requiring the inclusion of other railroads in the territory if they petition for inclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.612" offset="693791">In this case for example, the Commission had no control over the timing of C&amp;O-B&amp;O, Norfolk and Western-Nickel Plate, Penn-Central merger applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.263" offset="740394">It had no control over Erie-Lackawanna's withdrawal of its original petition for inclusion in Norfolk and Western, a withdrawal to improve its bargaining position.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.990" offset="783339">And again on this case, the Court had -- the Commission has no control over the non-participation in its hearing of the railroad appellants in 642.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.578" offset="841644">Since 1940, the Commissioners authorized to approve carrier mergers or unifications which it finds to be consistent with the public interest and upon just and reasonable terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.519" offset="893471">Here, the Commission approved a Penn-Central merger and authorized its consummation, while reserving jurisdiction to provide opportunities for the inclusion of Erie-Lackawanna, Delaware and Hudson, and Boston and Maine and Norfolk and Western are in a Penn-Central system.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.574" offset="981661">It's clear from the briefs of the department and the railroad appellants in 642 that they are asking that consummation of Penn-Central which they, along with the northeastern states and the executive -- and the executive branch of the federal government, generally favor as being in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.830" offset="1062640">They ask that as consummation be deferred indefinitely until there has been a final determination by the Commission and inevitably they mean by the courts of the faith of a smaller railroads in the northeast.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="256.315" offset="1128678">What if I for example thinking about this case decided, well, I was interested in postponing indefinitely but included in this attitude of railroads is that it would be postponed at least until the Commission concludes the protective proceedings and settles its mind on what the condition should be.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.970" offset="1235257">Well, I think that question is in the case before Your Honors but I think that's a separate question.</text>

          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="288.211" stopTime="291.185">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="288.211" offset="1256260">Well, it is if you -- is that all you're going to say about that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="291.185" stopTime="426.162">
            <label>Mr. Robert W. Ginnane</label>
            <text syncTime="291.185" offset="1268067">I guess pretty yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.186" offset="1276113">I'm addressing myself now to broader confession which is involved in the case and which was ruled on by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.906" offset="1311013">As a practical matter, this means under their contention, deferment of consummation until determination of the newly proposed N&amp;W-C&amp;O Dereco plan and look what's involved there.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.871" offset="1378826">After hearing that might be that the Commission can fix terms for the inclusion in that system if it approves it, of Norfolk and Western of Central of New Jersey and Reading, Erie-Lackawanna, Delaware and Hudson, Boston and Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.043" offset="1451551">But it cannot compel anyone of those small lines to accept those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.173" offset="1472031">And indeed if Norfolk and Western C&amp;O don't like the terms, they can decline to go ahead with their merger or they may litigate the terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.181" offset="1512051">In effect it forced the Commission into the discarded planning approach of 1920 and still without the powers of coercion which underlying to the failure of the 1920 planning approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.213" offset="1576208">The practical point is that if -- that proceedings either to determine the inclusion of Erie-Lackawanna, Delaware and Hudson and Boston and Maine into the present Norfolk and Western system or under their -- and to their broader proposed system with the Dereco plan, with court proceedings, the administrative and judicial proceedings were talking about delay, not measured in months, but in terms of years, three, four or five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.453" offset="1717164">And we submit that the Commission in its report on reconsideration was wholly realistic in concluding that if the Penn-Central merger with a substantially unchallenged major public benefits is not -- is differed for that longer period, there can be no assurance that it will ever take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.249" offset="1804413">We point out --</text>

            <text syncTime="677.449" offset="2813158">The Commission was unwilling to exceed the request for consummation for merger for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.727" offset="2854327">The merits of the merger almost uniquely were not being challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.092" offset="2871777">There was no challenge, essentially no challenge to each findings as to the substantial service improvements which would result for large segments of the shipping public and to the almost incredible annual savings of $80 million a year which the carriers can achieve.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.722" offset="2942307">In addition, the Commission sought consummation of a Penn-Central merger as the only solution for the continuance of New Haven's transportation services.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.270" offset="2984417">No one has proposed a New Haven solution other than inclusion in this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.805" offset="3010644">Under the statute, the Commission cannot, it has no power to require Penn or Central or any other carrier separately to take on any of New Haven's operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.047" offset="3059545">Its only power is under 5(2)(d) to require inclusion of New Haven as a condition to approval of this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.333" offset="3100714">This is the only solution for New Haven.</text>

            <label>Mr. Hugh B. Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="786.643" offset="3249925">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.703" offset="3262151">I appear for the Pennsylvania Railroad and New York Central in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.263" offset="3296423">There are two problems here.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.742" offset="3314291">One is the problem whether the Commission's finding that this merger is in the public interest is valid and should be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.495" offset="3357341">That is the point to which the arguments in the City of Scranton, and Mr. Shapp directed yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.514" offset="3389419">The other question is whether assuming that the finding of the mergers in public interest is valid, the merger should be consummated now or at some differed time, It was at that point the arguments of the carrier appellants were directed yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.574" offset="3477713">I should like to begin by saying a little about the arguments that were made against the merits of the Commissions' decision as to the public interest element of this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.784" offset="3574471">In our brief, we have questioned the standing of Mr. Shapp and the City of Scranton to raise these points.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.353" offset="3612818">I should like to rely upon that discussion in the brief and to leave that point in that posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.424" offset="3645106">In our brief, we have also discussed the merits of those attacks upon the findings of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.832" offset="3674676">And again in large part, I should prefer to rely upon that discussion in the brief as to the merits of the attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.008" offset="3707382">But there are one or two comments that I should like to make about the arguments that were made yesterday about the Commission's findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.559" offset="3753566">And I shall begin by commenting on Mr. Keyserling's arguments or at least the main branch of his argument which involved it seem to me two related ideas, closely related.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.610" offset="3833814">One was that the Commission had not given proper consideration or attached enough weight to the improved financial position of these two carriers in 1964 and 1965 and that the other was that the Commissions' order was invalid because in the event, it turned out that projections that Mr. Keyserling made about traffic volumes in 1964 and 1965 were a great deal better as indeed they were than in traffic projections that were offered in the evidence by the two railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.045" offset="3999535">Now, these arguments are related because I understand Mr. Keyserling's position on economics it is the 1964 and 1965 refers on a chart that should gone up and Mr. Keyserling believes, of course he is an eminent columnist.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.380" offset="4064841">He is good -- entitled consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.221" offset="4080306">These curves are going to keep on going up and up and the railroads here involved are going to enjoy prosperity that will follow from the rise of these curves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.421" offset="4129102">Now the fact is that the Commission considered that arguments so that it can't be said that the Commission ignored it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.713" offset="4150209">It had before it the figures as to 1964 and 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.763" offset="4178422">It made two points about this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.584" offset="4193677">In the first place it said that looking at the historical record, it was not prepared to accept the idea that the curves were going -- to keep going up and up and up without any deviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.191" offset="4248116">But it said apart from that that even if it accepted, even if it accept the projections that Mr. Keyserling had made, that did not change its views about it's basic findings because on the record that the satisfied -- that the historical record again that the railroads was not necessarily, at least two railroads particularly share proportionately and even in a great degree these increases in a national prosperity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.693" offset="4374131">Now, this is all in the finding and the Commission supported that -- these detailed findings pointing out even in these two years which were years of unprecedented at least in recent years of income for these two railroads their rates of return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.038" offset="4443512">In the case of Pennsylvania were slightly less or not more than 2% or too low by any -- even by conservative standards and indeed were lower than the return you could get on government bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.306" offset="4504639">It reviewed and made findings about others financial facts relating to the conditions of these railroads in the pre-historical period of time covered by the findings, pointing out for over a period of time their rates of return, this is a finding made by the examiners, confirmed by the Commission, their rates of return were less than 2%, about 1.77% over a period of 12 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.217" offset="4620204">There was a period of five years immediately preceding the decision when these two railroads did not have enough net income, net income from their own railway operations to pay their fix charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.865" offset="4678823">In those years, they have not had income from activities that were not related to their own railroad operations, they would not have been able to pay those fix charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.932" offset="4723127">Now, I submit on that basis that it cannot be said that the Commission ignored Mr. Keyserling's arguments and that they ignored the facts on which he bases those arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.858" offset="4766804">He is entitled to be verified by his success of profit on the traffic volume but I submit that under the normal standards of traffic -- of judicial review the question here is not whether Mr. Keyserling is wiser than the Interstate Commerce Commissioners in terms of economic theory but whether the Commission made adequate finding based on substantial evidence which it did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.971" offset="4875264">Now, I only want to try and comment briefly on one other point that was made in this connection which has to do with the argument made by Mr. MacDougall for Mr. Shapp and again, I'm going to rely largely on what was said in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.459" offset="4937226">That argument suggests that the Commission and the examiners made an error of law because they didn't understand the public interest standard laid down in Section 5(2) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.860" offset="4990830">Now, I respectfully suggest that if the members of the court will look at the examiners' report and the Commission's report, it will appear that what the examiners and the Commission did was to comply strictly with the definitions that this Court laid down in the Louden case and in the New York Securities Company case and in cases which have been decided since the Transportation Act of 1940 was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.606" offset="5105768">The other statutes such as the Appalachian Region Relief Act (ph) that Mr. MacDougall talked about simply has nothing to do with Section 5(2) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.898" offset="5151013">What Mr. MacDougall's complaint really is, I think that he again believes that the Commission didn't give proper attention to the effects of this merger on the certain communities in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.703" offset="5202213">I respectfully invite the Court again to look what the examiners did, what the Commission did in terms of findings about Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.162" offset="5244008">Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.351" offset="5252786">It's now supporting the merger in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.269" offset="5276400">Those findings are detailed and they show that Commission the most cheerful consideration on the facts to what the merger effect would have on the transportation services and facilities available to the state of Pennsylvania and found on the basis of those detailed findings with evidence to support them that would benefit Pennsylvania and not -- now with that, I should like to leave the questions of merits and move to the matter that was chiefly subject to discussion yesterday which is when should this merger be consummated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.418" offset="5421014">The Commission has twice found that it would be in the public interest for the merger to be consummated halfway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.698" offset="5450167">It made that finding first in its initial report in connection with its discussion of the protective conditions that it was prescribing for the Erie-Lackawanna, Delaware and Boston and Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.522" offset="5505442">It made it again more detailed in its report on reconsiderations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.840" offset="5538774">Mr. Ginnane and --</text>

            <text syncTime="1393.320" offset="5676701">The Commission said, it will not be in the public interest to consummate this merger unless there are protective conditions that will preserve the status quo and prevent these three railroads from having their service impaired by the diversion of traffic to diverge 10% that is basic finding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1428.367" offset="5816822">And the Commission went ahead and said to this end as I construe their opinion, to this end, we say that it may be consummated now subject to the conditions that we specifically set out in Appendix G.</text>

            <text syncTime="1538.170" offset="6256097">There was however, and what I'm saying now is all in this brief to look in the appendix, there was some evidence however before the examiners about the attitude of the Central of New Jersey towards the merger because the State of Pennsylvania which was collecting evidence at that point to oppose the merger wrote to the Central of New Jersey a letter and said, “What about it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.785" offset="6338539">Is this going to hurt you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.827" offset="6346689">And Mr. Shoemaker who was then is now the president of Central of New Jersey wrote a letter back and said, “No.</text>

            <text syncTime="1569.389" offset="6380962">As a matter of fact, it is going to improve our interchange position because it strengthens the position of the merged carrier.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1584.346" offset="6440730">At that point, the New Haven was a subject of argument in the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.370" offset="6468838">After it became and seemed to be likely that's a New Haven and this was really after the hearings had been closed except on the matter of labor conditions, after the hearing had been closed to that extent with the labor condition still open, one of the periods of New Haven might be included.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.605" offset="6537801">The Central of New Jersey came along and said we would like to intervene and said we'd like to intervene solely for the purpose of showing that the inclusion of the New Haven in this merger will injure us, that's the only point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.518" offset="6593494">They didn't talk about the things that Mr. Cutler has been talking about today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.367" offset="6608854">And the examiners or the Commission said, “Alright, you can intervene but we don't -- we're not going to reopen this proceeding at this point to take evidence about what New Haven will do to you because that whole matter is going to be handled in a hearing about the inclusion of the New Haven.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.687" offset="6678131">Now their hearing about the inclusion of the New Haven starts next Monday and that Central of New Jersey as prior to that hearing and one of the issues is what kind of protection shall be given to the Central of New Jersey, prevent traffic diversion as a result of the inclusion of the New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.081" offset="6755662">Now the Central of New Jersey after that did nothing until the examiners had made -- they're prepared with proposed report and then it came along and filed exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.018" offset="6803414">Now, I must say that in those exceptions, it indicated that it was rather unhappy about the merger, but it was rather vague about it -- not anyone is interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.020" offset="6839463">I would like the Court to look at this document because it made some complaints about it but it didn't propose any specific conditions for its protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.711" offset="6878229">It didn't ask to be included in anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.941" offset="6891186">It complains -- so far as it complains only about two specific things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.257" offset="6912397">One was the New Haven inclusion and the other was a proposal that the examiners had made that the Pennsylvania should be required to give the D&amp;H some traffic rights in connection with this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.328" offset="6956701">And the Commission dealt with those things in its initial report and said, “Alright, you get a hearing on whether there is going to be any diversion of traffic from -- by the New Haven in the New Haven proceeding and that this trackage right thing has to be done by a contract which we have to approve and you will get a hearing and the hearing on that contract on what should be done in connection with the trackage rights to prevent diversion of your traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.746" offset="7058369">So I submit that up to last July-August when the Central of New Jersey filed its petition for reconsideration here, the Commission has afforded the hearing on the only complaint of this railroad that was specifically made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.637" offset="7125870">Now, this thing that I devoted too much time to but I want to say one thing more because -- and then I should finish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.253" offset="7168397">Mr. Cutler's portrait of the Central of New Jersey is wasted to his wondering on administrative wasteland where no man comes is a little less heartrending I think to read his brief carefully because it's apparent that what the Central of New Jersey is really saying is that the only thing that can be done will solve our problem, is to approve the B&amp;O and N&amp;W and the C&amp;O merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.093" offset="7275708">It's true we have these prosperous relatives, the B&amp;O and C&amp;O and the -- but do they not -- going to give us any money unless the Commission approves this larger plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.643" offset="7325968">So this argument, I think it's apparent in what the nature and purpose of the argument is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.440" offset="7345089">Now, I should like to move on to the question which I think is the important question here and it affects the railroads to the protected railroads who really may have a legitimate interest in this and I think the arguments entitled serious consideration and that is the question whether this merger should be differed until there has been a final determination on the protective condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.673" offset="7442056">Because I think if that is essentially the position of the Erie and the D&amp;H, and in view of the Commission's finding about what will be done to them by the merger and the importance of their service is, their arguments are entitled to serious consideration and this is a serious problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.572" offset="7525648">Now, it is our position that the merger should not be differed pending that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.232" offset="7564309">I think that there seems to me to underline the arguments of the D&amp;H and Erie in assumption that if it is not deferred, they are not going to get this full protection from the Commission in form of these conditions as they would if the merger is deferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.136" offset="7639960">That is more of an implicit and an explicit assumption but it really seems to me to color their arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.975" offset="7663261">There is another assumption that seems to me that color their arguments and that is that the question of the validity of the conditions turns not on what the law or the statute requires that they'd be given but what they would like to have and I'm going to sum it again on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.847" offset="7734732">What I suggest is there's nothing in this -- in either of these assumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.184" offset="7752077">The Commission has found that they are entitled to this protection and the Commission has said it's going to give it to them and it's not retracted in anyway from that -- at least drawn from that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.994" offset="7799306">Now, if in this hearing on the protective conditions, assuming the merger is consummated, conditions are prescribed which these protected lines don't like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.660" offset="7842043">They unlike the Pennsylvania and New York Central have the right of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.918" offset="7863045">I suggest if the reviewing court finds that the conditions that the Commission has prescribed do not satisfy the Commission's own findings as to what is required and remands the court -- the case to the Commission to do a better job that the Commission will do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2053.138" offset="8315904">Well, you had an estimate from Mr. Ginnane about the time that would take in the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.116" offset="8335862">I think he said the first June or something of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.501" offset="8353416">That's my recollection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.168" offset="8359999">Now, what time would be consumed after that in judicial review is difficult to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.422" offset="8389047">I will -- I point out as you've observed sir that this case has been handled very expeditiously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.585" offset="8417677">Judge Friendly in that court below handled it expeditiously and goes back to the same course, I assume it would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.081" offset="8443695">I would expect that it would handle it expeditiously again but I would assume in June that the best we could hope for would be perhaps another decision by this Court sometime next term, but that's a very rough guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.518" offset="8505448">I might better of course -- you must remember that the way this argument is shaping up, it seems likely that there maybe not one set of plaintiffs in that review proceeding but two, the Erie-Lackawanna and the D&amp;H will say the conditions don't do enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.885" offset="8582875">The Norfolk and Western and the C&amp;O will probably be there saying they do too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.268" offset="8600430">So it will be another case where there will be these conflicting problems and that they're complicate it but that's the best I can do Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.118" offset="8647868">Now, the other arguments that the Erie and the D&amp;H made about the necessity for postponing this merger while the protective conditions are being finally determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.676" offset="8718085">It seem to me they take two lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.451" offset="8725191">In the first place, they suggest that in the interim period, while the Commission and the courts are considering these conditions, they won't really get effective protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.582" offset="8777749">They say that the traffic conditions which will be in effect once the merger is consummated, they're not really effective, but no one knows what they mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.679" offset="8826128">Again, I invite the Court to read Appendix G.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.504" offset="8845354">That appendix starts out with a direction that says, that Penn-Central shall not change or establish any rate or practice or service or engage in any other practice that changes the status quo where the effect would likely to divert traffic from these two protected railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.804" offset="8954546">Now that categorical in that first paragraph is followed by five sub-paragraphs in which the Commission says, by way of illustration and not of limitation this is what you must do and this is what you must not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.590" offset="9021733">Now, I suggest by any standards of particularity and precision and clarity that are reasonable that appendix will effective certainly if it -- where it contains as it might well be by so far as this content is concerned and the decree of a court of equity, I cannot believe anyone would say that the decree was so vague as to be in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.866" offset="9114833">There are just two other observations I will make about this argument about the traffic conditions being in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.945" offset="9143150">The D&amp;H I think their counsel have said Representatives of Pennsylvania have made conflicting statements of different times about what the traffic conditions mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.151" offset="9187976">I think that those statements have read in context that they appear as they are not really basically inconsistent, but I think that that's irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.329" offset="9220681">Pennsylvania isn't going to construe these conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.659" offset="9234056">The Commission has said to these carriers, you must comply with these conditions and you must comply with spirit of not only the letter and it provided a summary -- I'm sorry --</text>

            <text syncTime="2534.440" offset="10241128">I understand and my -- our position is of having said that and having considered the problem on petitions for reconsideration of the Commission, again determined that it could and would protect these lines as its basic finding required it to do even though it involves some change in these conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.015" offset="10327437">And mind you, as far as the protected liens were concerned what they were asking for were improvements and the Commission's report on reconsideration says that the Penn-Pennsylvania and New York Central said that they would have no objection to improvements that were designed to strengthen the protection to these lines and they waive the right to judicial review as opposed to traffic conditions in the indemnity pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.556" offset="10449586">I submit that in those circumstances where the Commission feeling if there were valid reasons for public interest for going ahead with this merger that the measures it took to comply with its basic finding and to provide relief for these carriers were added.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.086" offset="10515728">Another argument that has been made by the protected carriers which is, I think a branch of their argument that these traffic conditions will not be effective is an argument that is directed perhaps to the -- one of the Commission's reasons for saying that the merger should be consummated promptly and that is that if the traffic conditions are effective then the savings contemplated by the merger cannot be affected while the traffic conditions are in effect and therefore, there's no reason to prompt the compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.564" offset="10721677">Now, this is related to a matter that I mentioned a moment ago in response to the question from Mr. Justice Fortas because that argument rests on two misconceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.012" offset="10759398">One is that these savings are going to start accruing immediately in substantial amounts and that the service will be improve as a result immediately to mergers made -- that Commission did not make findings that kind of view the matter that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.020" offset="10831496">It takes time to these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.089" offset="10839751">The problem here on consummation is when are these railroads to be allowed to start because before you can do any of these things that get into a point where they are producing the results that are in the public interest, it takes a great deal of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.977" offset="10903280">Now therefore, the suggestion that because the Penn-Central suggested from or prevented from diverting traffic from the two lines, they will not be able to make any of the start of these improvements that will ultimately savings is simply not supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.888" offset="10982902">About half of these savings, ultimately will be accomplished by consolidations or reconstructions or expansions or contractions of terminal facility and that can be done without diverting -- you can start on that work without diverting any traffic from these protected lines or without in any way violating Appendix G.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.700" offset="11082167">The Selkirk yard which was mentioned yesterday is a good example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.160" offset="11096064">That's going to take months at least and perhaps years to really get started on that job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.076" offset="11119679">That's a big job, and if roads are allowed to consummate this merger, they can start on that work without diverting any traffic at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.230" offset="11172342">There a suggestion is also been made that it is not possible to really prescribe any conditions that will effectively protect these roads in the interim period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.547" offset="11245589">Now, the interesting difference in view among the road -- the appellants about that, I don't understand, at least the Erie and the D&amp;H seem to me approach that argument somewhat gingerly, they indicated points if they have some doubts but they don't embrace it whole heatedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.032" offset="11339525">The Solicitor General in his brief seem to think that the Commission could lawfully devise effective conditions in this reopened hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.460" offset="11381217">At least he said that the Commission has the obligation and the authority to hammer out a solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.698" offset="11410160">It is the Norfolk and Western and the B&amp;O who say that the Commission cannot lawfully devise any conditions that will really protect these three railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.806" offset="11458644">Of course, it's difficult for me to avoid the impressions with that and I suppose this is patent in their argument that this is not a contention that's prompted solely by the Solicitor with the interest of those rail roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.976" offset="11519248">The argument is that these protective conditions with the indemnity provisions specifically are an unlawful pooling arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.311" offset="11560626">The E&amp;H and the -- the Erie and the Delaware and Hudson specifically have rejected that notion in their brief taken before the Commission, and we think the right for four reasons which we set out in our brief and I'd rather not go into detail here but we think that it is clear from those reasons that the indemnity provisions prescribed by the Commission in the first place and any indemnity provision that maybe prescribed in the future will not be unlawful as unauthorized pulling arrangement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2918.846" offset="11778800">But presumably and I use that word recognizing the weakness in it, the indemnity provision will have the same -- some of the same characteristics as the one that exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.330" offset="11824671">If there is any change, the change is more likely to be a change that would remove even the basis for the argument of illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.163" offset="11864064">In the inclusion proceedings, there was some suggestion that the way to provide indemnity was not on this formula basis which is now done, but by on time of day basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.617" offset="11913801">Now, if you do that, the whole pooling argument obviously collapses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.556" offset="11933550">So my response is that if there's a change as far as illegality is concerned, I think it would almost certainly be regarded the change for the better.</text>

            <text syncTime="2989.685" offset="12062072">Yes, there is such an argument, again which we have dealt with again in our brief and I will say this about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.084" offset="12087672">I think our answer hinges in large part on the responses I made your question about our reading of the findings made by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.480" offset="12129259">Now in addition, we have pointed out you know in our brief that the Commission as a matter of administrative practice many times has found that a transaction of this kind will have or may have adverse effects on employees and has approved the transaction nonetheless reserving for later decision, the exact character and content of the conditions that should be attached to take care of those adverse effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.584" offset="12253706">We have cited other cases in the brief including Rock Island Truck case where this Court has held that the Commission can issue a motor carriage certificate to a railroad and validly reserve the right later to attach conditions to that certificate to make sure that it complies with the statutory standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.394" offset="12348897">This -- the -- we submit that if you look at Section 5(2) and the words of Section 5(2) that the section does not impose any absolute and categorical limitation upon the power of the Commission to approve a transaction on condition which it specified in the terms it has here and at the same time reserving the right to give content or to change, revise the conditions in -- subsequently in ways that are consistent with its original basic finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.252" offset="12480345">That is the only legal argument that I'm aware of that has been made in this case about the Commissions' lack of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.302" offset="12520573">In the remaining time, though I think it's – the matter has been perhaps adequately covered, at least some aspects of it by Mr. Ginnane, I want now to speak briefly to the other problem and it is whether this transaction should be -- consummations should be delayed until there has been a final determination on the question of the inclusion of the three smaller railroads in some larger system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.673" offset="12658082">The -- Erie doesn't make this argument at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.210" offset="12672188">The D&amp;H made it in its brief but I understood that yesterday its counsel to modify that stand to say somewhat, and to say that possibly once the protective conditions were determined, they might be satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.857" offset="12730807">This is an argument that is really pressed and pressed vigorously by the Norfolk and Western.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.649" offset="12754004">And I think it's important and Mr. Ginnane's touch on this to understand just what that position is and what it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.209" offset="12780231">This is the position of Norfolk and Western and the C&amp;O.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.574" offset="12801651">The position is that these three roads should not and cannot be taken in to the independent N&amp;W system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.899" offset="12831013">They have resisted that in the proceeding before Mr. Commissioner Webb.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.625" offset="12849821">They have indicated that they're going to file exceptions to his report and I assume if the Commission firms that report, they will seek judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.306" offset="12888586">That's the first step.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.215" offset="12892244">The next step is that they say these three railroads cannot be included in the Penn-Central merger because that would create a rail monopoly in doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.657" offset="12945951">So they say, the inevitable consequence is that these three railroads can only be taken care of if the Commission will approve that both N&amp;W and C&amp;O merger, and as a necessary corollary of that conclusion they say that if the Commission cannot approve the N&amp;W and C&amp;O merger and thereby provide a home for these small lines then Penn-Central merger should never be consummated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.213" offset="13088266">And they have taken that position frankly as I understand it in the conclusions or in the reopened petition hearing on the conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.683" offset="13126092">So that this is an argument and approach which not only involves protracted delay as Mr. Ginnane has pointed out, but it's a delay which is entertained or indulged in with a specific possibility in the mind that at the end of the period of delay, there will be no Penn-Central merger at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="4001.259" offset="16108440">One need only to look at their briefs to see that there is nothing more that they intend to offer if this case went down on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.965" offset="16147205">I would like to address myself in my argument to three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="4019.486" offset="16181269">I must say at the outset I'm afraid I'm not going to reach them all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4022.472" offset="16193285">The first is what is the effect on the New Haven if this merger is delayed?</text>
            <text syncTime="4027.958" offset="16215228">The second is to add a few comments on the historical perspective of this case, and finally, if time permits, I want to address myself to the private interest question versus the public interest findings by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4044.055" offset="16279594">Before I get in to the substance of my argument, however, I would request of the Court, on behalf of the trustees, a special procedure in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4056.537" offset="16329540">We are asking the Court to issue its order herein, prior to entry of its opinion, no matter what your decision may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4066.689" offset="16370082">I refer in this connection to Aaron versus Cooper in 358 U.S., Mesarosh versus U.S. in 352 and Collins versus Loisel in 262 and the reason is, whichever way you decide this case, we go to trial next Monday in New York on a plan of reorganization that is premised on this merger going through.</text>
            <text syncTime="4094.015" offset="16479483">If this merger isn't going through, we're going to waste additional assets of this estate upwards of $1 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="4101.546" offset="16509576">We've already been authorized sums of that kind to prosecute the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.513" offset="16529429">If you decide therefore that this case cannot be decided in our favor which is to say, to quash this stay and let the merger go forward, we've got to consider as fiduciaries whether we go back to Judge Anderson and find out whether any money should be spent until one knows whether or not there's going to be reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4129.381" offset="16620857">Conversely, if you enter an order which permits this to go forward, we can go forward with the assurance that one day and I'm going to come back with the time in question, but one day, the New Haven will enter in its home and that isn't the issue, is there a home for the New Haven.</text>

            <text syncTime="4160.732" offset="16746350">We're out of time schedule now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4162.341" offset="16752724">Well, let me go back a bit to explain why I say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.890" offset="16762964">The New Haven is the most incredible reorganization that any railroad or reorganization law has ever run into and the reasons are quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.720" offset="16798281">It's in a section of the Bankruptcy Act because it has to be under that section, there's no alternative, but this is a section that never contemplated a railroad without income available to pay fixed charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="4187.452" offset="16853138">It's been nine years that the New Haven has not had income available for fixed charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="4193.033" offset="16875499">That means just by definition, you can never have a capital structure for the New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="4198.587" offset="16897755">Now what do you do?</text>
            <text syncTime="4200.254" offset="16904338">You do what the trustees have done for five years which is through a combination of capitalization of the property, subsidy from the states, deferral of priority claims, I'm speaking now of real estate taxes and tort claims, deferral of all these things meets your payroll.</text>
            <text syncTime="4218.979" offset="16979257">They have done it for five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4220.349" offset="16984795">You can't go on doing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.733" offset="16994304">Now this Court may decide just to draw a complete conclusion to your question Mr. Justice Stewart, may decided that in the overall public interest, the interest of the Erie-Lackawanna and the Delaware and Hudson, outweigh the benefits to the public from preserving the New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="4238.305" offset="17056580">I don't say you can't decide that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4240.181" offset="17064103">The Commission of course didn't decide that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4242.288" offset="17072567">They decided the New Haven was paramount, decide if you will the opposite but if you decided, as I said earlier, please enter your order now because if there's another meeting that can be saved here, the trustees ought to save it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4259.921" offset="17143097">The New Haven's concern with the delay in consummation is two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="4265.260" offset="17164413">Until the merger is consummated, the merger is exposed to the risk that will never be a merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.973" offset="17199313">And if it never will be a merger, we don't have a home and I'm going to come back to this and show the findings that have been made in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4282.192" offset="17232123">The second point is, until it is consummated, the New Haven's ability to continue to finance this, if you will, ridiculous financial situation is completely nullified but once the merger is consummated, we know there is a place where the New Haven can go.</text>
            <text syncTime="4300.571" offset="17305684">We know that because the Commission has absolutely provided as a condition that they must take the New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="4306.980" offset="17331284">Now, I'm not concerned whether the terms which the trustees have negotiated and I may say this is in a complete contract of whether those terms of the final terms and not just in irrelevancy because once the merger is consummated, the New Haven one day will be taken and whatever terms those terms may be, the New Haven will be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.016" offset="17411427">That means that during the interim period whether these trustees or some other trustees run this estate, they can go to banks, they can go to the states, they can say, here is what it's going to cost, here is the reasonable period of time required, but if you don't know whether there's going to be a merger, if this Court merely sense this back for further proceedings, if we're faced with a two to five years that Mr. Ginnane predicted and I may say, I thought he was perhaps modest in his predictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4356.016" offset="17527411">If we're faced with that, we don't even know where to get the next dollar.</text>
            <text syncTime="4362.535" offset="17553533">Now, I'd given you the two reasons why a merger must go forward so far as the New Haven is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4368.891" offset="17578924">Now, let me explain to the Court if I may why those two concerns have a bearing on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4376.065" offset="17607659">First, are the New Haven's operations essential in the public interest?</text>
            <text syncTime="4381.555" offset="17629602">Well, the Commission specifically found that and in the court below, Judge Winfield did not disagree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4388.807" offset="17658650">And in fact, in the Erie-Lackawanna reply brief in this case, the following statement is made at page 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="4396.986" offset="17691355">The importance of preserving the New Haven is not disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.167" offset="17708074">None of them disputes that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4403.615" offset="17717791">The Erie-Lackawanna brief goes on, the question is, is it necessary because of the New Haven to put Erie-Lackawanna, D&amp;H and B&amp;M in the most serious jeopardy in order to have a consummation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4416.596" offset="17769723">I think that is not a correct statement of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4419.017" offset="17779440">I'm prepared to show the Court today that they are not put in jeopardy because the protective conditions are adequate and proper, but even if I accept the question as put by the Erie-Lackawanna, I would say to the Court, yes it is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4435.313" offset="17844642">It is necessary because the New Haven is essential and there is no other way to save it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4442.218" offset="17872227">That brings me to my second point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4445.854" offset="17886751">Does inclusion in Pennsylvania and New York Central save the New Haven?</text>
            <text syncTime="4462.293" offset="17952580">Answer?</text>
            <text syncTime="4451.987" offset="17952475">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4452.638" offset="17952371">The Commission found specifically that and nobody disagrees with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4457.052" offset="17952266">Third, is there any other possibility of saving the New Haven?</text>
            <text syncTime="4463.134" offset="17955924">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="4464.078" offset="17959685">The Commission specifically found that and nobody disagrees with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4473.450" offset="17997197">The Commission said and this is at 328 I.C.C. at 312. Absent the applicants' merger, we see no solution to the New Haven problem. Certainly, neither of the applicant separately can be required to take over New Haven's deficit written operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4490.910" offset="18066996">Nobody disagrees with that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4493.206" offset="18076191">In fact, no one really quarrels with this syllogism I have just been through.</text>
            <text syncTime="4497.717" offset="18094268">The quarrel comes on whether a delay really exposes the New Haven to a risk that the merger will abort.</text>
            <text syncTime="4505.823" offset="18126660">Thus, if it aborts, it frustrates completely the preservation of the New Haven and the public interest in having that railroad preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4514.373" offset="18160828">So let's look at the question, am I over stating this question?</text>
            <text syncTime="4519.129" offset="18179845">Well, the risk that the merger will abort was found specifically by the Commission, they addressed themselves right to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4525.393" offset="18204923">They said, if consummation of the applicants' merger delayed several years or indefinitely, we can have no assurance that it will ever occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="4535.439" offset="18245151">The factors that enter to an agreement to merge sooner or later can be affected by changing conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4541.801" offset="18270542">And then they went on to say, “We are not prepared to take this risk involved in a substantial postponement of consummation of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4550.764" offset="18306382">Moreover and this is the language that I would bring specifically to the Court's attention, moreover, we are not prepared to take the risks which delay of consummation of even 6 or 12 months might entail.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4564.800" offset="18362598">Now, the 6 or 12 months was picked up out of these petitions for rehearing file by various of these appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4571.254" offset="18388407">And the court was saying, “Not even six months.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4574.600" offset="18401782">We -- the Commission, I beg your pardon, the Commission will say, “Not even six months will we take this risk.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4579.932" offset="18423097">And as a matter of fact, if the court will look at the calendar, four months have already elapsed since September in this -- that I've just read to you was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="4592.726" offset="18474297">But N&amp;W and C&amp;O and B&amp;O whose interest in this case is demonstrated by their briefs and argument are certainly rather remote, but they on one hand, in Erie-Lackawanna which has a real interest on the other hand, assure the Court that there is no such risk of an abortion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4612.994" offset="18555382">Mr. Trienens said to the Court yesterday, there is $81 million of glue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4622.739" offset="18594356">Mr. Bourne in his brief on behalf of Erie-Lackawanna says, the risk that this would be aborted in the near future is and I quote “miniscule”.</text>
            <text syncTime="4632.617" offset="18633853">Now each in its own way either begs or distorts the question that the Court must decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="4639.213" offset="18660185">The risk is not that Penn or Central voluntarily with that way as Mr. Cox just told the Court, of course they won't.</text>
            <text syncTime="4648.021" offset="18695502">Apart from that I would agreed that $81 million of glue is a lot of glue, but it's not the glue that's the important thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4657.517" offset="18733432">It's, will this merger abort in spite of their desire to get that $81 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="4663.692" offset="18758092">That's the risk which the New Haven is subjected and apart from the questions that Mr. Cox addressed himself to of how do you manage, continue to manage and a price of this size vested with the public interest without knowing whether tomorrow you're going to be a combined company or separate company without knowing what you do about employees or construction programs or orders for new freight cars or building of yards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4687.395" offset="18852968">You can't manage indefinitely under those circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="4716.117" offset="18967803">The Commission's order gives the Penn-Central the same rights that the New Haven has today to move for changes in its passenger service under the Transportation Act of 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="4725.152" offset="19003956">It gives them no special rights nor the states demand special rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="4733.490" offset="19037288">Not to my knowledge sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="4738.708" offset="19058186">As I started to say, more important than the problem of corporate management, living without knowing what's going to happen, is that no matter how much they want this merger to stick any plan, a plan of reorganization or a merger plan which is based upon a stock exchange ratio as Mr. Cox pointed out is particularly vulnerable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.192" offset="19152123">In fact, it is almost too numerous to less.</text>
            <text syncTime="4765.847" offset="19166751">The members of this Court know that whenever you have a merger plan or reorganization plan based upon an exchange ratio, it's subject to vagaries of changes and circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4779.407" offset="19220982">What Erie-Lackawanna makes the prediction that the likelihood of a change in the near future that is a change in circumstances is minuscule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.275" offset="19260479">It is foolhardy or naive in making such a prediction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4794.268" offset="19280436">One thing is certain even if it is minuscule and let's assume for that purpose that it is, this was a risk which the Commission refused to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="4804.576" offset="19321710">Now, it had to make findings on both sides and it did and it refused to take the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="4809.923" offset="19343026">The appellants ask the Court now to take this risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="4815.759" offset="19366431">Now because you're being asked to take the risk, I think it is fair to consider what the consequences of the risk are.</text>
            <text syncTime="4823.188" offset="19396106">If this merger aborts as demonstrated by the syllogism I went through earlier the New Haven will be forced to liquidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4832.817" offset="19434663">Now, what does this mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="4836.252" offset="19448351">It must first be realized that if the New Haven liquidates, service to 17 million persons, that being the population of the service area of the New Haven is adversely affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.084" offset="19511672">On a daily basis, the New Haven carries 65,000 of those persons on its passenger trains.On</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.377" offset="19544900">a daily basis, the New Haven now, brings in and out of New England 60,000 tons of freight and the livelihood as well as the food of persons depends -- the cost of food depends on this kind of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4876.052" offset="19607594">If it were not so, this would be moving by some of them right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4881.098" offset="19627760">These are the direct consequences of a social and public nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4889.384" offset="19660884">The Court may recall questions asked by Mr. Justice White yesterday of Mr. Trienens with respect to a gross revenues test in determining importance of railroads, a table which appears in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4906.260" offset="19728384">Let's just look at that gross revenue test.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.771" offset="19738415">In the point of view of comparing the New Haven with some of the other parties here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4913.315" offset="19756596">Even as hopeless a bankrupt as the New Haven, has revenues that are twice as large as the Boston and Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4922.070" offset="19791600">They're nearly two and a half times as large as the Central of New Jersey and they're nearly three times as large as the Delaware and Hudson, you'll find this right in the front of the B&amp;O brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4934.181" offset="19840084">Now, even as to the Erie-Lackawanna, it must be realized that its merger was made effective only in 1960 as recent as that and it was a combination of the Erie Railroad and the Delaware-Lackawanna and Hudson Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4949.073" offset="19899643">Today, the New Haven's gross revenues are more than half of the Erie-Lackawanna and if you will look at the two components that just came into the system six years ago, the New Haven was as important as either one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4962.586" offset="19953768">So if you're talking importance on the test used by Mr. Trienens, this is a terribly important railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4971.444" offset="19989191">If you look at net income as Mr. Justice White did yesterday, this is a very sick railroad when one recognizes the size of its revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="4981.058" offset="20027643">Now, do I overstate the likelihood of liquidation as the alternative solution?</text>
            <text syncTime="4986.374" offset="20048854">I think in this respect, the best I can do is refer the Court to Judge Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="4993.825" offset="20078634">Judge Anderson as the Court knows was the District Judge when this railroad filed reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5000.530" offset="20105488">When he was elevated to the Court of Appeals, he continued to sit by designation as the District Judge on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5008.075" offset="20135685">He has complete continuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5009.998" offset="20143313">Quite recently, we had occasion to ask permission to file a reorganization plan based upon our contract with Penn-Central in order to carry out that very inclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5022.459" offset="20193259">Now, this was opposed by some of our bond holders on the ground that what we have was not a plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5027.918" offset="20214993">This is part of the question that Mr. Justice White earlier referred to today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5032.738" offset="20234324">But this is what Judge Anderson said in directing the trustees to proceed with the plan which is now to be heard next Monday in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="5041.187" offset="20268074">I'm reading from B (9) of the Appendix to our brief which is Judge Anderson's opinion, “Were there no alternatives available on proceedings initiated by the creditors, liquidation would be called for.</text>
            <text syncTime="5056.161" offset="20328051">Nevertheless at the present moment, liquidation, close as it may be cannot presently be entertained as a reasonable alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="5065.411" offset="20365040">No such proceeding has been commenced and from the record of this case and the recognized cost in both time and money of liquidating a railroad such as the New Haven, which for many years has been a deficit operation, the Court concludes that so long as there is a reasonable possibility that the New Haven can be sold and then operated as part of a trunk line system like the Penn-Central, a plan of reorganization designed to that end is in the best interest of all concerned including the bond holders.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5096.279" offset="20488443">Now, we had occasion in an earlier opinion to refer to this question of rather than New Haven would have to be liquidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5104.078" offset="20519685">At that time and this was about two years ago, he referred to Mr, Justice Holmes opinion in Bullock versus State of Florida and he quoted this language, “apart from statute or express contract, people who have put their money into a railroad are not bound to go on with that at a loss if there is no reasonable prospect of profitable operation in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="5126.336" offset="20608711">No implied contract that they will do so can be elicited from the mere fact that they've accepted a charter from the state and have been allowed to exercise the power of imminent domain.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5137.284" offset="20652492">And in the same opinion he quoted from Judge Frank in Third Avenue Transit where Judge Frank says, “As the debtor is a public utility, the judge properly took into account the factor of the public interest and the debtor's continued operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5151.511" offset="20709439">That, however, is but one factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5153.775" offset="20718425">It must not be allowed to outweigh all others.</text>
            <text syncTime="5156.523" offset="20729501">There are strict limits to the extent to which in reorganization proceedings, the interests of creditors or of a particular class of creditors may be sacrificed to the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5166.691" offset="20770147">To exceed those limits is to save the least from dangerously close to the edge of unconstitutional taking of the property, a line from which courts should keep away if possible.”</text>

            <text syncTime="5254.097" offset="21119770">What I'm asking is a very specific question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5257.422" offset="21133040">What we have before us now is a denial of a temporary or interlocutory injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5266.477" offset="21169298">Now, that denial was entered in the absence of a final order of the Commission on a private proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5277.495" offset="21213393">The Commission, I'm troubled because the Commission in its findings said that that -- in this inadequate protective order we're in it -- the Commission would not approve consummation of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="5293.132" offset="21275878">Now, what I'm asking you is whether it would be possible as a matter of law number one, number two as a matter of practicalities of the merger, one of the following would be possible that this Court approve -- affirm the decision of the District Court and leave open the possibility that in June or July or whatever it is that the Commission enters its order with respect to the protective conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5328.488" offset="21417357">The motion for temporary injunction can be renewed in the Three-Judge District Court at that time and whether it would still be confronted with a -- an acute form of unscrambling the omelet and whether in those -- in those circumstance, such a procedure would be compatible with legal and orderly process.</text>

            <text syncTime="5375.723" offset="21606275">First, the Commission never contemplated that the protective traffic conditions were fixed and immutable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5384.528" offset="21641488">As Mr. Cox touched on today and I would read the language that he touched on, in fixing the conditions and this is part of their order here, they said this, “for the purpose of illustrating,” I'm reading from Appendix G as page 561 of their opinion, “for the purpose of illustrating but in no way limiting the application of this condition, the following specific conditions are prescribed, and then to complete the pattern, they go over to paragraph C on page 562 and they say -- paragraph D “all determinations as to whether the Erie-Lackawanna, Delaware and Hudson or B&amp;M is a competitive factor and they digressed for a moment, these are all key to a definition of competitive factor, is a competitive factor shall be made within 10 days after a complaint is filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="5491.556" offset="22069582">However, we do not believe that this uncertainty is one which justifies postponement perhaps for several years of large public benefits which will flow from applicants' merger, and what I say to you Your Honor is this, the larger --</text>
