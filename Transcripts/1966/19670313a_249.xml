            <text syncTime="35.876" offset="247912">This case is here on petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.013" offset="272468">It involves a wide-range of constitutional issues which include the following questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.660" offset="295037">First, the constitutional validity of a parade permit ordinance, second, the constitutionality of the administration of that ordinance, and then the question of the admissibility of evidence to establish the mode of this administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.655" offset="355015">The validity of an injunction which embodies that ordinance in toto and requires parties to refrain from a lengthy enumerated series of lawful acts, the applicability of the so-called Mine Workers rule, that is the question of whether one may litigate first in the Alabama courts, and second in this Court, the validity of a permit ordinance and the validity of the injunction and the action for contempt, the constitutionality of the finding of contempt based upon statements by petitioners expressing outrage at the issuance of the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.970" offset="488239">And the validity of a finding of contempt against certain petitioners against -- on whom the papers had not been served.</text>

            <text syncTime="108.694" offset="539126">Well, we would submit the master question in this case is the constitutionality of the permit ordinance because we would say thereby the injunction falls and because of the nature of the First Amendment questions involved in this type when it affects one's speech, the so-called Mine Workers rule does not apply and we have -- there are reasons in state law where the Mine Workers rule does not apply also.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.170" offset="629091">But I was about to say Mr. Justice Harlan that while it would be impossible to discuss within 30 minutes -- because it will be impossible to discuss within 30 minutes all of these issues, all of which are rather serious, I planned to focus upon -- but one or two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.910" offset="684053">And in view of the fact that the United States in an amicus brief has addressed its attention exclusively to the so-called Mine Workers problem and the position in their brief is the same as ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.298" offset="729610">I do not plan to discuss that question, although I would of course be happy to answer questions concerning it, if the Court has any.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="272.551" offset="1194590">Mr. Justice Fortas, I think that we face -- we might just posit two-types of situations, and one in which is there's merely a permit ordinance on the books and there is an interest in regularity of enforcement, an interest in perhaps applying and attempting to obtain a permit under that ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.192" offset="1293124">Yet this Court has recognized in numerous cases that if that cont -- ordinance is unconstitutional on its face whereas applied one may violate it with impunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.428" offset="1334084">On the other hand, we might posit a situation in which we might assume that injunctions ought to be obeyed until they are litigated and disposed of on the injunction rather than on the contempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.678" offset="1399077">I would say this is a hybrid situation in which the injunction embodies in toto the ordinance and merely transforms the mode of its enforcement from ordinary criminal misdemeanor proceedings to contempt proceedings and we would argue that it falls in the permit ordinance type category of cases rather than the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="350.398" offset="1505970">We also have an argument which I think is -- which we would submit is correct and that is that under Alabama law, this is the first time that the scope of reviewing contempt has ever been so narrowly interpreted that in the case of Fields against City of Fairfield which came to this Court and was reversed on no evidence grounds, there was a question of the validity of a permit ordinance involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.767" offset="1591442">The Alabama Supreme Court appraised the validity of the ordinance then appraised the validity of the injunctive order passing upon the merits as part of one of its foregrounds for assessing the validity of the contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.832" offset="1647762">One of which was whether the injunction was on its face void.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.199" offset="1661241">It held it was not void and affirmed the contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.570" offset="1670646">We say this isn't exactly this category, and in a speech's state ground -- non-federal ground for affirmance was given.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="446.204" offset="1889238">Well, Mr. Justice Harlan, let me address myself to it then.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.424" offset="1902090">And I think in order to understand the context -- the Mine Workers, the so-called Mine Workers doctrine and the other issues involved in this case, it's important to see the context in which this case arose because First Amendment rights, prior restraint questions, questions of -- all the questions involved in this case turn on the context of the situation, the enforcement of the ordinance and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.458" offset="2006267">This case -- issues arose on an incidence which occurred four years ago known as the Birmingham Demonstrations of 1963 which were acknowledged to have been the impetus to passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.685" offset="2063109">Birmingham at that time was a virtually, a totally segregated community.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.949" offset="2080141">Nine years after this Court's decision in Brown against Board of Education, there had been absolutely no school desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.421" offset="2106055">Fifteen years after this Court's decisions in Sweatt and Mclaurin pursuant to state policy, the University of Alabama remained racially segregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.992" offset="2140327">This Court's decision in Gober against City of Birmingham reflects the unconstitutionality of the racial segregation ordinance within the City of Birmingham.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.282" offset="2189542">The ordinary channel to which democratic change might be affected, that if by exercise of the ballot were clogged, only 11% of Birmingham Negroes were able to vote and after passage of the 1965 Civil Rights Act, the rather low degree of Negro discretion was confirmed by the fact that federal registrars were sent into Birmingham.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.974" offset="2284314">And we submit that the First Amendment claim in this case -- that with regards to the First Amendment claim in this case nothing is a greater testimonial to the wisdom and utility of the First Amendment as a mechanism for affecting change democratically than the fact that the exercise of speech, assembly and other First Amendment rights in Birmingham at this time informed the conscience of the nation and helped changed this situation not only in Birmingham but indeed in other parts of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.808" offset="2407612">Those First Amendment rights were not exercised without opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.773" offset="2423495">Numerous decisions of this Court indicate and as the report of the United States Civil Rights Commission indicates which is quoted at some length in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.389" offset="2453901">It said that street demonstrations were regularly suppressed and the police follow that policy and they were usually supported by local prosecutors in Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.163" offset="2493085">The particular facts that of which this case arose were as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.596" offset="2522760">These demonstrations were part of the series that began on early April.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.853" offset="2535821">Birmingham has a parade permit ordinance set forth and quoted in our brief on page 4 which ordinance was embodied in toto into the injunction in this case and it stated that the Commission, the City Commission will grant the permit for parade processions or other public demonstrations unless in its judgment and I quote, "for public welfare, peace, safety, health, decency, good order, morals, or convenience require that it be refused".</text>
            <text syncTime="637.131" offset="2652954">One of our -- as part of our argument we submit that this parade permit ordinance is unconstitutional and indeed, the Alabama Court of Appeals in a case arising out of this very march that's involved in this case and involving one of the very petitioners here, held that ordinance unconstitutional.</text>
