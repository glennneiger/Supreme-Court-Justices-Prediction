            <text syncTime="34.122" offset="239888">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.856" offset="254830">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Seventh Circuit upon the petition of the Federal Trade Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.801" offset="286595">It presents for decision the question of whether the enforcement policy of the Federal Trade Commission is to be determined by the Commission or by the several Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.168" offset="340093">More particularly, the question presented is whether the court below exceeded the proper bounds of its authority, in staying the Commission's order that Universal-Rundle cease-and-desist from violations of the Robinson-Patman Act until the Commission makes an industry-wide investigation of the pricing practices of Universal-Rundle's competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.935" offset="435075">It is recognized on all sides I believe, that the issue here is governed by this Courts decision in Moog Industries which held that the Commission's determination whether or not to withhold the cease-and-desist order until competitors are proceeded against, is not to be overturned by the Court of Appeals in the absence of a patent abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.249" offset="532355">Universal-Rundle is a manufacturer of plumbing fixtures.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.210" offset="548237">In 1957, it enjoyed net sales of approximately $24 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.373" offset="572897">It sells it wares to some 8000 dealers under its UR brand name.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.425" offset="601109">In addition, it sells plumbing fixtures to Sears, Roebuck and Company, which are retailed under Sears' private brand Homart.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.340" offset="640711">Sears is of course a very large retailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.078" offset="651682">Its annual sales volume exceeds $3 billion and Sears, Roebuck owned some 60% of Universal-Rundle's capital stock and I should say it was this intimate relationship between Sears and Rundle that led initially to the focusing of attention on Rundle.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="158.184" offset="736110">Does the Trade Commission order cover the Homart products or just the U.R. Products?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_s_rifkind" startTime="164.025" stopTime="513.346">
            <label>Mr. Robert S. Rifkind</label>
            <text syncTime="164.025" offset="759515">It does not because it was eventually determined after very lengthy hearings, most of which had been deleted from this record that the Homart and the UR lines were not of like grade and quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.061" offset="811656">On August 4, 1960, the Trade Commission issued two complaints charging Sears and Rundle respectively with violations of the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.726" offset="854288">The complaint against Rundle alleged that Rundle was violating Section 2 (a), in two ways; first, by selling fixtures to Sears under the Homart brand at lower prices than it sold its UR line of fixtures to competitors of Sears and second, by selling its own UR line at different prices to purchasers competing in the resale of the UR line.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.451" offset="969226">A motion by Commission's counsel to consolidate the two cases was denied by the hearing examiner and hearings were then commences the Rundle case in October 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.125" offset="1011858">Following the close of those hearings, the examiner found as I've just indicated to Mr. Justice Fortas that the Homart and UR lines were not of like grade and quality, and he therefore dismissed so much of the complaint as charged -- as charged Rundle with discriminating in favor of Sears.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.190" offset="1088136">With respect to the remainder of the complaint, the hearing examiner found that Rundle sold UR brand plumbing fixtures to some purchasers in the Philadelphia-Camden area at prices substantially below those charged by respondent for products of like grade and quality to other competing purchasers in the same market area.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.065" offset="1179669">He also found that in the competitive circumstances prevailing, the disfavored dealers were likely to suffer competitive injury if Rundle's discriminatory practices were to continue and he therefore ordered Rundle to cease-and-desist from discriminating in price between customers who compete in fact with each other in the resale of Rundle's fixtures other than the Homart line.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.327" offset="1284681">On cross-appeals to the Commission, the hearing examiner's initial decision was affirmed in all respects that are relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.420" offset="1317073">The Commission rejected Rundle's contention that the requisite injury to competition had not been shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.226" offset="1344240">In particular, the Commission held that the fact that price differential was -- were attributable to truckload discounts which were offered to all customers did not negate competitive injury because it has been shown that truckload discounts were beyond -- the truckload quantities were beyond the buying capabilities of some of the customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.753" offset="1442356">The Commission's final order was issued on June 12, 1964 and on July 20, 1964 Rundle petitioned the Commission to withdraw that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.729" offset="1498258">The petition also prayed that reentry of the order be stayed for 18 months that it be reentered only on 30 days notice to Rundle, and that an immediate temporary stay issue pending a decision on the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.145" offset="1559907">The petition alleged that the stay was sought to afford the Commission sufficient time to investigate and institute whatever proceedings are deemed appropriate by the Commission to correct the industry-wide practice of granting discounts on truckload shippings.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.527" offset="1629497">The petition further alleged that if the cease-and-desist order was not stayed pending corrective action of industry-wide practices, Rundle would suffer competitive disadvantage and extreme hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.863" offset="1678817">In support of these contentions, Rundle attached exhibits indicating that its six principal competitors, all offered truckload discounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.585" offset="1713716">It also urged that Rundle's market share exclusive of its sales to Sears was 5.75% ranking sixth in the industry and that Rundle suffered losses in the proceeding three and a half years whereas its six major competitors had enjoyed profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.626" offset="1793860">An affidavit of Rundle's marketing vice-president stated that the company may suffer further substantial financial losses if it must be the sole plumbing fixture manufacturer under an order to cease-and-desist.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.419" offset="1849031">The Commission denied the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.452" offset="1857181">In doing so, it's stated that the fact that respondent may have incurred losses prior to the issuance of the order, does not support the contention that enforcement of the order will cause a financial hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.033" offset="1907545">It also stated that the general allegation by respondent that its competitors are granting truckload discounts is not a sufficient basis for -- instituting industry-wide proceedings to condemn this practice nor is it a valid reason for withholding enforcement of the cease-and-desist order.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.579" offset="1985703">Rundle then sought review in the Court of Appeals of both the cease-and-desist order and that an order denying the stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.735" offset="2010363">The Court of Appeals reserved decision on the cease-and-desist order.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.225" offset="2028231">Accordingly, the merits of that order are not now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.315" offset="2048606">On the other hand, the Court of Appeals set aside the Commission's order denying Rundle's petition for a stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.030" offset="2079535">The Court found that the Commission had directed its attack against a general practice which is prevalent in the industry, but that in doing so, it had selected one who share in the market is less than 60% whose discounts were lower on the average than its competitors'.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.457" offset="2153200">It also held that the Commission --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="535.389" offset="2244942">Out -- out of the Court, how the Court of Appeals, they found these precise factors which followed in throughout the industry without reaching the merits?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_s_rifkind" startTime="548.395" stopTime="767.657">
            <label>Mr. Robert S. Rifkind</label>
            <text syncTime="548.395" offset="2296978">That is one of the great mysteries of this case Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.047" offset="2307532">As I'm trying to point out in the minute, the Court of Appeals found that Rundle's competitors were guilty, more guilty than Rundle, but it declined to determine whether Rundle was guilty and I'm sure Mr. McAleer has very substantial criticisms of the order on the merits which he was urging also before the court and which hadn't been reached or which have to be decided at some point.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.074" offset="2407633">Under the -- I should just add at this point that under the decision, the Commission conceivably could launch an industry-wide investigation occupying it for good many years, and come back to find that its original order against Rundle is in some respect defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.715" offset="2482239">Furthermore, the -- the Court of Appeals held that the order of the Commission involved the sacrifice of a comparatively small manufacture when, as I suggest, when as I have suggested it's larger and more guilty competitors “are not prosecuted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="614.837" offset="2562696">Finally, it held that the Commission had a duty to conduct an industry-wide investigation and that Rundle's showing was sufficient to require the Commission to make Rundle's competitors parties to the proceeding against Rundle.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.814" offset="2618598">We submit that the Court of Appeals started from mistaken premises, applied an unsound legal standard and produced an entirely unworkable result.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.386" offset="2660916">First is we've just alluded too, it started with a premise that Rundle's competitors were guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.167" offset="2696025">There is no basis in the record as far as we can see, as far as the Commission could see for reaching that as a definitive matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.882" offset="2730924">There are defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.629" offset="2741896">There are individual circumstances that have to be shown in each case, a violation of 2 (a), a truckload discount is not a per se violation of 2 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="670.392" offset="2784946">Second, the Court accepted at face value Rundle's assertion that it might lose business if the Commission's order is not stayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.889" offset="2814934">Indeed, the Court -- the Court apparently concluded sub selentio or perhaps ignored the question that the harm the Rundle would suffer from the order out weighs the harm its competitors would suffer -- I'm sorry, its customers would suffer from staying the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.815" offset="2882644">After all, the Commission had determined the people were su -- were suffering from these discriminatory practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.386" offset="2912946">In doing so, the Court of Appeals ignored evidence that Rundle's prediction of significant injury in implausible.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.426" offset="2945128">Thus, there was testimony in the record that Rundle had already ceased to deal with the smaller customers who had been unable to purchase in truckload quantities.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.008" offset="2983372">Nor, did the Court consider that under the Commission's order, Rundle remained free to grant discounts that are justified by lower costs, free to grant discounts to meet the prices -- prices of competitors in good faith and free to grant discounts that do not operate to discriminate between competing customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.590" offset="3061739">And I'd particularly like to stress the availability even under the order of the good faith meeting the competition defense because the Court of Appeals doesn't seem to have focused on the fact that Rundle pleaded as part of its own case, good faith meeting competition and then for reasons which it alone knows, failed to prove a good faith meeting a competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="786.651" offset="3249925">Suppose the record showed beyond any possibility of argument, that Rundle's competitors were worse than Rundle was and all of the relevant respects and the Commission's order was -- was going to put Rundle out of business in the interest of its competitors.</text>

            <text syncTime="871.449" offset="3589204">Rundle is perfectly free assuming its competitors are injuring it to bring treble damage actions, to bring injunctive actions to stop that sort of activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1122.640" offset="4593977">This isn't a review to see whether there is substantial evidence supporting that Commission determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.267" offset="4624488">The Court assumed that the Commission has wantonly proceeded against one of the smallest of a group of violators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.374" offset="4656880">Indeed, the court found that “the industry is according to the record limited to a few.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.013" offset="4687391">Nothing in the record indicates how many firms there are in this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.809" offset="4702647">The record does, on the other hand, indicate how many competitors Rundle has and they are more than a few.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.522" offset="4729501">On page 112 of the record, Rundle's vice president, Mr. Backner named 17 firms with which Rundle was in competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.549" offset="4765550">And at page 171, Mr. Backner added an 18th and indicated that there were perhaps 20, 25 or more such firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.050" offset="4807555">Yet, the court below apparently focused only on Rundle's six largest competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.264" offset="4828453">It failed to note that while Rundle is one of the smaller of the largest firms, it is nonetheless larger than most of its competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.431" offset="4869099">But the court adverted to the fact not in the record that nearly a year after the Commission's denial of the stay, the Commission's counsel informed Rundle's counsel that an investigation could not then be undertaken because it would conflict within an industry, within an investigation of the industry being conducted by the antitrust division.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.408" offset="4977037">The Court of Appeals dismissed this latter investigation as somehow not qualifying as one by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.872" offset="5006817">It thus leaves the Commission in the unhappy -- with the unhappy choice between letting Rundle continue with unlawful discriminations or launching in an investigation which is likely to immunize defendants and thus forwarded two pending criminal price-fixing cases, against leading members of the plumbing fixture industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1369.190" offset="5580152">The Court of Appeals apparently has found that the other firms are violating the law and has directed that the cease-and-desist order against Rundle be stayed pending corrective action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.029" offset="5631457">These dilemmas, we submit are merely indicative of the fundamental difficulty with the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.023" offset="5655489">The Court of Appeals, we suggest, misunderstood this Court's holding in Moog Industries, that the Commission's determination to stay or not to stay, a remedial order, may not be overturned to the absence of a patent abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.782" offset="5730513">We suggest that a Court of Appeals can properly hold that an administrative agency has people who abused with this discretion only if it finds that the agency has based its decision on consideration having no rational relationship to the relevant statutory policy to be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.533" offset="5805537">No such finding has been or could be made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.675" offset="5846079">As I have suggested in our judgment within the scope of discretion left by Moog, affirmed by Moog, a Commission -- the Commission is free to decide to proceed intensively or extensively against many firms in a few industries or a few firms in many industries, is free to decide that it could be most effective by proceeding against the largest firm in an industry or the most typical firm in an industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.174" offset="5976064">And it can elect, I submit, to make an example of one violator in an industry in the hope of the others will be brought around, if not by altruism, then by the in terrorem effect of the order or the threat of reality of private treble damage actions and injunction actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.827" offset="6050670">And again, the Commission may certainly act in the light of information that is received in confidence as to the enforcement plans of other agencies of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.701" offset="6090167">All of these choices, whatever their wisdom or unwisdom fall well within the area of discretion committed by Congress to the Commission and may not be overturned by the Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1522.974" offset="6195284">In a decision rendered on June 12th 1964, the Federal Trade Commission found that Universal-Rundle Corporation, a manufacturer of cast-iron and victor's China fixtures had violated Section 2 (a) of the Robinson-Patman Act by granting a discount averaging 10% on plumbing fixtures sold under respondent's brand name in truckload quantities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.869" offset="6306879">The Commission ruled that such discounts may adversely affect competition on the buyer level since the truckload quantities were deemed by the Commission to be beyond the buying capabilities of certain of respondent's customers who competed with a customer buying in truckload quantities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.867" offset="6390888">On July 20th, 1964, Universal-Rundle requested the Commission to stay the effective date of the order for at least 18 months and within that period of time for the Commission to undertake an investigation of the truckload discount practices of respondent's six principal competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.456" offset="6485243">In requesting this stay, Universal-Rundle brought the following matters to the attention of the Federal Trade Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.956" offset="6511156">First; the Commission was furnished with each of respondents six major competitor's price-list and price bulletins showing that plumbing fixtures purchased in truckload quantities were priced not 10% but approximately 18% below the price paid for identical fixtures by those competitor's customers in less than truckload quantity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.465" offset="6613243">The Commission was advised if the company sale with Universal-Rundle branded fixtures accounted for approximately 5% or precisely 5.75% of the total industry sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.572" offset="6661622">With this market share being one of the smallest in the industry, while four of respondent's competitors' sales accounted for 66% of the total industry sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.926" offset="6711045">The leading manufacturer's share and a manufacturer who were shown to be granting a truckload discount of 18%, his -- that company's share of the market was 32% and the second breaking manufacturer's share of the market was 15%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.722" offset="6786278">The Commission was informed by Universal-Rundle that it had incurred substantial losses during each of three years immediately preceding the entry of the Commission's order to cease-and-desist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.305" offset="6836642">These losses amounted to over one-half million dollars, during each of the three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.807" offset="6866631">The FTC's attention was invited to publish by native data showing the substantial profits of its six principal competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.004" offset="6911352">In an affidavit by its vice-president in charged of marketing, the company predicted that an immediate entry of the cease-and-desist order against Universal-Rundle for engaging in an industry-wide practice without the FTC taking some action to correct this industry-wide practice of granting truckload discounts would have the direct result of substantially decreasing its sales volume which would then be taken over by its large competitors who were free to continue to engage in the same practice of granting truckload discounts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2185.289" offset="8844518">It was the view of the Court of Appeals that the Commission's refusal to either stay the order or undertake an investigation of the industry-wide practice of grating truckload discounts was inconsistent with the overriding policy of the amended Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.739" offset="8910346">And the Court ruled that the pendency of the Department of Justice proceeding did not serve to excuse the Commission's refusal to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.783" offset="8946500">The basic question as I see it presented to this Court for decision is whether the Federal Trade Commission, the agency charged by the Congress with the primary responsibility for enforcement of the Robinson-Patman Act acted arbitrarily in an abuse of its discretion when it chose to ignore the pricing practices of Universal-Rundle's competitors yet insisted that an immediate order be entered against that company and that company alone for engaging in the same pricing practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.710" offset="9090173">We have set forth three reasons in our brief why we think the Commission committed a patent abuse of discretion in this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.766" offset="9126431">Briefly summarized they are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.800" offset="9138552">The court below was unable to detect how enforcement of this order against Universal-Rundle Corporation coupled with an FTC flat refusal to investigate any other plumbing fixture manufacturer would be in conformity with the statutory objectives of Congress in enacting to the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.693" offset="9234160">That Congress was placing its trust in the FTC that it would not enforce the statute in such a way as to lessen or impair competition at any distributional level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.728" offset="9294242">It is our position that the FTC in taking the action it did in this case, failed to consider how it's refusal to investigate any the other manufacturer's truckload discounts could only contribute to a further increase in the high degree of concentration shown to exist in this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.878" offset="9386924">Yet, entry of an order against Universal-Rundle would not benefit any of Universal-Rundle's customers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2385.953" offset="9647208">To comply with the order, Universal-Rundle has only two practical choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.416" offset="9673017">The company could eliminate truckload discounts or it could terminate those customers the FTC deems incapable of buying in such quantities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.191" offset="9712097">If it made the first choice that is if it eliminated truckload discounts, the company's smaller customers would still be competing in the marketplace with other manufacturer's customers who continue to receive the price concessions on truckload quantities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.745" offset="9778343">Since it is obvious I submit that a company who's share of the market is a small as Universal-Rundle's is in no position to be a setter of marketing business, be a setter of policy with effective prices in this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.627" offset="9837902">And for this reason, elimination of truckload discounts would not affect the pricing practices of the large manufacturers such as American Standard, Kohler and the other companies mentioned in our petition for a stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.662" offset="9894013">Universal-Rundle's smaller customers, under these circumstances would be in no better competitive position as a result of the FTC's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.395" offset="9932988">If Universal-Rundle chose the second method and terminated customers unable to buy in truckload quantity, these customers undoubtedly would continue to purchase plumbing fixtures at the higher discriminatory price from one or more of respondent's competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.534" offset="9997458">Under these circumstances, it is quite apparent we submit that immediate entry of the order against Universal-Rundle would not make the adverse effect on the buyer level of competition since the terminating customers would still be buying in less than truckload quantity from a competitor of UR -- Universal-Rundle and at a higher discriminatory price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.186" offset="10092126">On the other hand, regardless of which of the two methods are taken by Universal-Rundle to comply with the FTC's cease-and-desist order, it's market share could only be decreased and it's last buyers would shift from Un -- was last buyers would shift from Universal-Rundle to the competitors who have larger market shares and who are free to continue to engage in the industry's wide practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.773" offset="10206438">The second reason we contend as to why the FTC abused its discretion in this proceeding is that it failed to heed the ruling of this Court in Moog Industries Inc. versus the FTC reported at 355 U.S. 411.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.574" offset="10277700">On page 413 of the Moog decision, this Court stated as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.948" offset="10311137">“Although an allegedly illegal practice may appear to be operative throughout an industry, whether such appearances reflect facts and whether all firms in an industry should be dealt with in a single proceeding or should receive individualized treatment, our questions that call for discretionary determinations by the administrative agency,” end of the statement from the Moog decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.415" offset="10421060">We submit that in Moog, this Court concluded that before the FTC exercised its discretion in determining whether it's a cease and des -- enter an order to cease-and-desist against one company, the Commission should have made some effort to find out whether the alleged -- allegedly illegal practice is in fact industry-wide in scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.401" offset="10532968">Here, when the FTC was confronted with document showing that respondent's competitors were granting truckload discounts of approximately 18%, here where in this very record that we've shown, five of the seven non-truckload customers of respondent also purchased from one or more of the other manufacturers, here, where the FTC found that a discount averaging 10% may lessen the competition in an industry in which price competition was intense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.734" offset="10658356">The FTC flatly refused to take any action to obtain the very type of information which this Court in Moog has held it should have had to make an informed decision as to the most efficacious method of enforcing the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.454" offset="10725230">The issue presented to this Court in Moog was whether an order to cease-and-desist should go into effect against one company before the time other competitors who were already being prosecuted or investigated were brought under similar orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.365" offset="10808822">This Court in effect held that the Commission was the master of its own timetable insofar as entry of an order to cease-and-desist was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.015" offset="10859395">It is readily apparent that this Court in Moog did not condone or sanctioned a flat refusal by the FTC to ignore industry-wide violations as it has done in the plumbing fixture industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.112" offset="10923865">Universal-Rundle has not asked that its order be stayed until similar orders are entered against one or more of its competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.654" offset="10958033">All the company ask is the FTC to investigate its competitors and after such an investigation for it then can determine whether the best enforcement policy is to invoke its adjudicatory processes to obtain compliance in this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.822" offset="11042670">And if so, whether an order should be entered against Universal-Rundle immediately or whether other methods such as the issuance of guides, trade regulation rules, assurances of voluntary compliance from each one of the manufacturers, would be the most expeditious and effective meth -- effective method of obtaining industry-wide compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.401" offset="11144965">The third reason why the FTC's action in this proceeding was an abuse of discretion is that in issuing an order against respondent and refusing to even investigate its competitors that Commission departed from its own announced enforcement policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.662" offset="11210062">The Federal Trade Commission has officially reported to the Congress in its annual report for 1964 and I quote from page 1 of that report, “Whenever a law violation was identified, the Commission instead of applying the simple and superficially vigorous method of hoping individual violators undertook to find out if their competitors were doing likewise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.330" offset="11332733">If they were, the Commission then decided how best this competitively generated evil could be eliminated with the least delay” of what the Commission has told the Congress is its enforcement policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.326" offset="11400652">The Commission has elaborated on this policy in testimony before the house appropriations subcommittee which is reported at 408 and 409 of hearings before Subcommittee App -- Appropriations of the Independent Offices 89th Congress first session and I quote from the chairman's testimony of the Commission to the Subcommittee on Appropriations of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.845" offset="11510784">“We have given a mandate to our enforcement bureaus, instead of taking these cases at as they come, one by one, the first thing they are to determine is whether or not this is an isolated situation that has come to our attention or whether it is something that is engaged in competitively by all competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.539" offset="11609527">If so, to step back and then with our resources, engage in what I would hope to be some basic planning and determine what would be the best tool and approach for us to take.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.843" offset="11662712">I'm still quoting from the testimony of the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.279" offset="11684446">“Historically, the Commission was wedded to the procedure of taking our customers or their cases as they came.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.481" offset="11713285">The Commission had hoped that with the tools that Congress had afforded the Commission to work with that even on a case by case method that proceeding against one, the others if it affected them, would take notice and follow suit, it just didn't worked that way.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.527" offset="11785488">It could be said,” said the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, “In all fairness to these people that if there were 50 engaged in the same practice, what certainty would a party have that if they stopped, the other 49 would stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.913" offset="11854973">In our country, very rarely can a man be his 'brother's keeper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.564" offset="11873677">I think this is the basis of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.411" offset="11885066">We are trying to enforce our law in the American way equitably and fairly.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.307" offset="11912652">That is the end of the quotation of the testimony by the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission before the House Appropriation Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.812" offset="11942640">We submit, if the Court please, that the Commission's action in this proceeding is diametrically opposed to and in conflict with the above quoted enforcement policy of this agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.595" offset="12005752">Here, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission has told a Congressional committee that at every instance when it identified the law of violation, its staff is under specific instructions to find out if competitors are engaged in the same practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.681" offset="12074088">Now, once it is determined that the practice is industry-wide, then and only then according to the Commission statements to the Congress does the Commission decides the best important method to eliminate the illegality.</text>

            <text syncTime="3016.910" offset="12171055">In short, this announced enforcement policy which the Commission refuses to follow in this proceeding suggests that the FTC has interpreted the Moog decision in precisely the same manner in which respondent has urged in its arguments before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.414" offset="12253080">The chairman of the Federal Trade Commission has candidly stated on several occasions why this enforcement policy has been undertaken by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.868" offset="12294875">He stated in a speech on June 16th, 1965, that may add for the benefit of the Court, copies of all of the speeches that we have referred to in our briefs had been filed with the clerk, that the policy according to the chairman, that the policy reported by the Commission to the Congress quotes, “gives all violators an opportunity to rid themselves of the illegalities simultaneously without suffering competitive injury in the process.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.777" offset="12414516">The chairman has summed up in a few precise words the rational of the lower court's relief in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.674" offset="12454118">Mr. Dickson who astutely observed “The man who is willing to comply with the law simply can't afford to if the competitor is allowed to go on violating it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.393" offset="12500929">No explanation was given by the Federal Trade Commission for deviating from its announced enforcement policy in the proceeding against the Universal-Rundle at the time the agency refused to grant the stay of its order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.648" offset="12557981">In this Court, the FTC claims that an industry-wide approach was not appropriate because the truckload discount practices of respondents were and I quote from page 12 of the reply brief “Ancillary to the main case involving discriminations in favor of Sears, Roebuck and Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.173" offset="12640110">The FTC however ruled that that company's prices to Sears, Roebuck were not in violation of the Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.581" offset="12677726">I submit that the FTC's characterization of the truckload discount practices as inquiry to its main case is in effect an admission that no complaint would have been issued if the company's prices to Sears had not been challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.841" offset="12758706">If this is correct, there would appear to be no reason for the Commission to have entered an order against the company unless it was at that time ready to undertake an industry-wide investigation of the truckload discount practices of other manufacturers in the industry which of course it refused to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.892" offset="12866957">In denying the stay in August of 1964 and refusing to take any action with respect to the other manufacturer's discount, the Commission, I submit, has done exactly and precisely what the Federal Trade Commission and its chairman have labeled as both “On bear to the sole company who is prosecuted and is,” and I quote again, “a superficial method of enforcing the law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.582" offset="12989733">This Court, we respectfully submit, should not reverse the lower court's decision in the instant case since the decision is in conformity with the announced enforcement policies of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.165" offset="13052008">I submit a reversal would be tantamount to this Court encouraging the FTC to proceed, to enforce the law in a manner which that very agency has and no in certain terms described as unfair and in conflict with the original purpose of the Commission of guiding the business without bringing down upon it the menace of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3661.327" offset="14748714">The Commission went on to rule that certain of our customers were unable to buy in truckload quantities and because these truckload quantities were beyond the buying capabilities of certain of our customers, the customers buying in less than truckload quantities were paying a higher price at a 10% price differential was sufficient to cause an adverse effect on the competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.761" offset="14842441">All the Commission had to do was to undertake an investigation of the other manufacturers and find out whether or not there was any co -- any other -- any customers of those manufacturers who would likewise unable to buy in truckload quantities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.357" offset="14900851">The Commission then could have applied the same rational at -- that it did applied it in this case and that is certainly in an industry where price was so significant and so important that where you had a price differential of 18% and you had some customers in a trading area who were unable to buy in truckload quantities that that was sufficient for the problem -- before the Commission to conclude that injury to competition maybe adversely affected.</text>

            <text syncTime="3879.091" offset="15619741">Secondly, it's -- it is also I think quite clear in response to the question Mr. Justice Harlan put, I think also the Chief Justice that the Commission has not precluded itself forever from investigating this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.209" offset="15684211">Indeed, in the very correspondence to which Mr. McAleer referred, at page 54 of our principal brief, the Commission's counsel wrote to McAleer, “In the meantime, it would be of considerable assistance to us and would contribute substantially to any investigation which we do undertake if you would advise me if the reasons they then have used which your client has for believing that some of the accounts listed in the exhibits to your letter buy fixtures from such and such firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.144" offset="15819943">Finally, all of the things that the Court indicated in Moog which might prompt the Commission to investigate this matter or not come down essentially to the critical factor that the Commission alone is empowered to develop its enforcement policy and to allocate its resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.061" offset="15923597">This -- the court below ignored that teaching.</text>
