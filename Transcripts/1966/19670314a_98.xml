            <text syncTime="24.843" offset="202794">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.677" offset="214079">This case is on certiorari to the Supreme Court of California from that Court's denial of a petition for habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.550" offset="249605">The case involves whether petitioner, an indigent, was provided appointed counsel on his direct appeal from a criminal conviction consistently with the requirements of due process and equal protection especially as stated in Douglas versus California.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.843" offset="334764">Petitioner was convicted of possession of marijuana in 1957 after a jury trial at which he had been represented by the public defender.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.675" offset="382098">He sought to appeal in forma pauperis in the California courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.006" offset="403414">A transcript -- a full transcript was provided and counsel was appointed to represent him.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.242" offset="432358">Counsel, however, informed the appellate court that he, the counsel would not file a brief, because in his opinion, there was no merit to the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.597" offset="485752">Petitioner then requested the appointment of another attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.057" offset="503620">This request was denied by the District Court of Appeals in California and petitioner was advised that he could file a brief pro se or allow the District Court of Appeal to decide the appeal on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.329" offset="568717">Petitioner filed a pro se brief, the state filed a lengthy answering brief, petitioner filed a pro se response.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.818" offset="606647">And the California District Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.806" offset="626604">This occurred in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.396" offset="640920">In January of 1965 after this Court's decision in Douglas versus California, petitioner sought habeas corpus in the California District Court of Appeal to reinstate his original appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.616" offset="709883">The District Court of Appeal denied his petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.888" offset="726915">Petitioner relied in his petition for habeas corpus on Douglas versus California alleging that he had been denied a federal right to representation by counsel on his direct appeal from the original conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.604" offset="797759">The order of the District Court of Appeals denying the reinstatement of the appeal was on the merits for it cited a California case In re Nash, a post-Douglas decision of the California Supreme Court as the basis for the denial of the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.238" offset="884276">The In re Nash case indicates that the procedure originally applied in this case meets in the view of the California Supreme Court the requirements of the Douglas case.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.080" offset="935685">Petitioner then sought habeas corpus on the same grounds in the Supreme Court of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.869" offset="962853">In California, there is no direct appeal from the denial of a petition for habeas corpus rather the petitioner seeks the same writ in the higher court.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.474" offset="1009246">The Supreme Court of California denied the petition for habeas corpus without opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.489" offset="1037354">The question here is whether the California procedure concerning counsel on appeal that was followed in this case adequately meets the requirements of Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.520" offset="1093465">Under that procedure which is in issue here, one that was approved, as I had stated in the case of In re Nash.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.872" offset="1130872">The District Court of Appeal on the first appeal as of right in a criminal conviction concerning an indigent proceeds to consider the case on the record and without lawyer prepared briefs for the defendant and without oral argument if appointed counsel files a so-called no merit letter with the appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.483" offset="1261275">There is no procedure testing the adequacy of the counsel's determination that there is no merit in the sense that the case ought not to be argued by a lawyer in behalf of the indigent.</text>

            <text syncTime="990.471" offset="4065259">There are three alternatives -- well, I think I'd prefer to just compare very briefly the procedures in Douglas and the procedures here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.618" offset="4125863">As I'd indicated before, two interrelated reasons underlay Douglas, one, the adversary system point and the other, the discrimination point between indigents and non-indigents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.197" offset="4180198">In my view, the infirmities and the procedure that were reject -- procedures rejected in the Douglas case are not cured under the procedure here where counsel is appointed but can withdraw with ease resulting again in appellate court consideration without benefit of briefs and argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.518" offset="4265462">First of all, only one side is represented on the appeal and that's the point to which I've been giving most of my attention so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.745" offset="4302346">And in that situation, as a matter of fact, the one side the state being represented on the appeal, the indigent is not only not represented but he's in a situation in which he has his attorney rather, his appointed attorney has made a statement that there is no merit to his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.315" offset="4384684">In my view, the discrimination problem in the Douglas case is not very ameliorated by the procedure in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.271" offset="4420420">In fact, in my view it's potentially worse because under the pre-Douglas procedure the Court, District Court of Appeal, screened the cases to determine whether counsel was appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.484" offset="4473292">Under this procedure presently existent in California, counsel who might have a number of reasons for not wanting to brief and argue, or at least for seeing himself in the position of amicus rather than advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.225" offset="4540270">In a real sense, does the screening, he makes the determination whether or not the defendant shall be represented on the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.834" offset="4578722">And so, in my view, the upshot is that the procedure like that in Douglas lends itself to producing appeals which involve non-frivolous issues in which the indigent in fact is not represented and this against his will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.333" offset="4648730">Your Honor, I should like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1469.801" offset="5982542">As soon -- and then some of the Courts even without asking the man will automatically assume if he's in prison that he's indigent, they won't even send this form out and they'll appoint counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.061" offset="6023607">Now, after counsel was appointed, he gets his record from the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.747" offset="6046386">Many times the client has the record he's in prison, the lawyers will come into the Court's office and look at the Court's copy of the record or they'll come to our office and borrow our copy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.952" offset="6087137">However, he has the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.597" offset="6093720">Now if there's any error at all, and this is to a paid counsel or counsel for indigents, then counsel's obligation undoubtedly is to point that error out to the Court by writing a brief and putting his client's best foot forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.214" offset="6164250">We have no quarrel with that at all we think it's done practically all the time depending again on the ability of counsel to recognize error in the record, after that's done, if a brief is written of course we get into the normal type of an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.306" offset="6240632">Now, the matter is set for hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.045" offset="6255574">It's been my experience watching appeals for about seven years very closely, six years, that oral argument in the District Courts of Appeal at least in Los Angeles particularly where about 60% of all appeals are handled is actually more of a fiction than a fact, and this is true with paid counsel as well as indigent counsel, because we find -- I personally, I just thought about it last evening have handled about 450 appeals in three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.197" offset="6396113">I don't believe I have orally argued more than possibly 50 out of those 450, and many of those included paid counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.120" offset="6435819">Now we do find as a practical matter that when somebody comes in and it's a very notorious case perhaps where they have gone out and hired the best counsel their money can buy, we find that those counsel will come in for the rich man and they will make an argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.075" offset="6531636">But it's a make wait argument, but it's done perhaps more to impress the client than the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1711.376" offset="6948864">Of that 2000 appeals, about 20% are paid counsel, of 400 appeals, the rest are indigent counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.310" offset="6980629">And of the 1600 indigent appeals left, we probably run about 10% of appeals where they say no merit in a letter like this, although this is becoming less frequent, or they write what I call a straw man brief where they set up the points involved if they think might be arguable, search and seizure or perhaps the Escobedo Rule or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.848" offset="7090761">And then they show how their case does not come under those rules and then the conclusion is there is no merit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2058.918" offset="8338996">But in this case, we come to the cardinal problem of what do you do when a competent counsel looks at the record and he says, “There is no error”.</text>

            <text syncTime="2089.097" offset="8459786">I don't think it requires an attorney to make up error when he knows there is none.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.772" offset="8486431">And there's bound to be some cases of this large group where there is no error, and if the Court has faith in its bar it can accept the attorney's word, but they go further in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.967" offset="8531257">Even though they have faith in the bar, the Court itself very carefully goes over that record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.193" offset="8556126">Now the Court in California does not only look, into my knowledge, to the points raised by the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2701.210" offset="10908191">And depending on the strength of the memorandum, they dismiss the case without even looking at the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="2747.139" offset="11091884">You do not have an appeal, it's something that only a trained person can look at and evaluate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2769.278" offset="11180492">And I don't think it matters that the man in the prison feels bad or has some idea that there's something wrong with his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.864" offset="11214869">I think his lawyer should consult with him to find out what he has in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.786" offset="11230542">But he can not evaluate that record unless he's the trained expert that the lawyer is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.152" offset="11255933">And it's this mesurement, and it's this objectivity to me that distinguishes regardless of what the client says in the prison, the error either is or is not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.630" offset="11305880">And if the lawyer looks and says, “There's no error” and then the Court looks and does not find any error, it seems to me rather futile to say that the Court should appoint another attorney to go out and look and see if there's more error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.299" offset="11364603">And it's like the old principle about carrying the cow at the county fair.</text>

            <text syncTime="3324.102" offset="13399751">But I would submit this that there will be many more instances where counsel will make arguments which are meritorious in the sense that they certainly bear consideration by the appellate court.</text>
