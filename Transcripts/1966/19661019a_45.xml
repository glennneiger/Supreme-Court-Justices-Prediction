            <text syncTime="42.064" offset="271653">Specifically we have asked this Court to revisit the decision of Palko versus Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.061" offset="303626">Specifically this case then concerned itself with whether the protection against double jeopardy is of such statute so as to be immune from state encroachment under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.300" offset="368619">The petitioner in this case was charged in two counts, the first was the violation in Indiana of the crime of reckless homicide and then the second count, the offense of involuntary manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.467" offset="429223">After a lengthy trial the petitioner was convicted only of the crime of reckless homicide and the jury returned no verdict on the count of involuntary manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.591" offset="481782">Although we submit it's not really germane to the academic question here, it is well settled in Indiana that jury silence on account is tantamount to an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.624" offset="525876">So I submit that in every legal effect this petitioner was convicted of the crime of reckless homicide and acquitted of the crime of involuntary manslaughter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1957.192" offset="7932113">The major question in this case is not whether the double jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment is incorporated in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth and therefore directly applicable to the states because even assuming arguendo that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.194" offset="7992195">Ronald Cichos was not twice put in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.938" offset="8011107">Let me just briefly go back to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.948" offset="8023124">Ronald Cichos went to trial on a two count, amended affidavit charging him with reckless homicide and involuntary manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.957" offset="8055202">The jury came in with a verdict, finding him guilty of reckless homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.133" offset="8079862">From that verdict he filed a motion for new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.126" offset="8099924">The trial court overruled his motion and from the ruling on the motion for new trial he appealed, the Supreme Court of Indiana assigning as his only heir the trial court's ruling on the motion for new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.804" offset="8158542">Supreme Court of Indiana granted him the exact relief that he prayed for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.795" offset="8174529">They grant him of a new trial which in Indiana under Indiana's appellate procedure means a complete new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.019" offset="8207444">And this is what he received on the second trial and also he received an identical verdict.The jury again came in finding him guilty of reckless homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.954" offset="8251225">It is our position that the petitioner's reliance upon Green versus United States is completely unfounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.830" offset="8278706">Green versus United States is wholly inapplicable to the case at bar on -- for several reasons, one of which is the waiver question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.657" offset="8314023">Now this Court rejected the Government's contentions on waiver on the double jeopardy on -- after a -- the granting of a new trial in Green Versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.368" offset="8352893">But that however does not dispose of the question on waiver in this case for the reason that in this case you're dealing with state appellate procedure and the constitution does not require a state to provide a system of appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.902" offset="8407019">Does not provide a system of appellate -- require a system of appellate procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.071" offset="8447666">This Court in McKane verus Durston said that a state may accord an appeal upon whatever terms it deems proper which was cited with approval in Griffin v. Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.826" offset="8494686">So it is our position first of all that Ronald Cichos waived the double jeopardy question when he sought a new trial in the Indiana Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.185" offset="8536064">The only limitation that this Court is put upon McKane v. Durston was that in Griffin v. Illinois when it said, "The state's appellate court system cannot be discriminatory under the Equal Protection Clause."</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.325" offset="8584652">It's not to say that a state must provide a system of appellate review but only that it cannot be discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.134" offset="8615894">So, the waiver question cannot be decided by this Court in the same way that was decided in Green because you are dealing with two different systems unless this Court is prepared to say that there is a constitutional right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.338" offset="8676707">It must hold Ronald Cichos has waived the double jeopardy question but even if we assume arguendo that he has not waived the double jeopardy question, Ronald Cichos was never twice put in jeopardy in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.033" offset="8739506">Because it's been pointed out Indiana law and we will agree with Mr. Price, reckless homicide and involuntary manslaughter where an automobile is involved or identical offenses requiring identical proof only the punishment differs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.153" offset="8803976">Reckless homicide carries a punishment of 1 to 5 as in this case, involuntary manslaughter 2 to 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.661" offset="8838040">It is for this reason -- it is our position that Stroud versus United States is controlling in the case at bar and not Green versus United States because here you cannot say that the jury silence is tantamount to acquittal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3525.453" offset="14205158">But double jeopardy since it did not -- since appellate procedure did not exist at common law as it does in modern America procedure involves questions of policy and policy questions which are not subject to the clear mandate of a constitution should be left to court's exercising there supervisory powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.587" offset="14317693">Therefore the policy questions should be left to the highest court's of the states rather to then to this Court with exception and this exception does exist that this Court, I think has recognized there is some double jeopardy in the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3576.429" offset="14409122">Now, the double jeopardy in the Fifth Amendment, I think we have to recognize is the double jeopardy that as applies in the federal system to modern appellate procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.404" offset="14460949">Therefore because it is a policy question it should be left -- supervisory capacity of highest courts of the states under this Court over highest courts in the federal system.</text>

            <text syncTime="3615.503" offset="14565334">May I first comment on the questions that have been asked concerning the Indiana statutes and the question of, if an acquittal occurs as to one offense the effect upon a second trial for the other and I refer to page 15 of our brief where the statute itself is quoted if I may take from that statute this sentence, "With respect to the offense of reckless homicide and involuntary manslaughter, a final judgment of conviction of one shall be a bar to the other."</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.546" offset="14689573">It does not say an acquittal presumably, State of Indiana especially if the Supreme Court has interpreted the statutes it could not only enact statutes endlessly for the same offense but could try then piecemeal under that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.565" offset="14761671">The state's argument, if it please the Court presumes that there is no constitutional encroachment regardless of how many times the legislature may reenact the same qualitative statute that there is never a point where this has constitutional implications and I submit to law is just not that calloused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.218" offset="14860204">The state says that Cichos here may have been put in jeopardy but he waived his jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.957" offset="14891238">He waived it by taken a new trail on the conditions that the State of Indiana imposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.776" offset="14914435">I submit to you that the state cannot impose a relinquishment of a constitutional protection as the price of an appeal whether an appeal be a constitutionally guaranteed right or not and I cite two cases from this Court that arose in Indiana, Dowd versus Cook, 340 U.S. 206 and Lane versus Brown, 372 U.S. 477.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.806" offset="15018611">There the appellate procedure for an indigent defendant was left solely to the discretion of the public defender whether the public defender wanted to order a transcript or not and this Court struck that down as discriminatory and improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.280" offset="15084544">The state could not impose this type of price for the exercising the right to appeal..</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.567" offset="15113592">On the question of mootness and no prejudice, I submit to you that any time may jury has within it the power to compromise on alternative counts for the same offense compromising jury possibilities of the worst sort are present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.585" offset="15193736">I submit to you that prosecution leverage of the worst sort is present when a state cannot only enact over and over again the same offense but can try over and over again for the same offense.</text>
