            <text syncTime="14.390" offset="160893">With the Court’s permission, I should like to spend a few moments of this time outlining the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.843" offset="190777">Petitioner has chosen to concentrate on the testimony of the witness Edward Morrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.236" offset="220348">This is only a portion of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.941" offset="231111">If that was the only evidence, it would concededly be inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.472" offset="253262">But petitioner has conveniently grossed over some very important elements of the record which I would like to call to the Court’s attention.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="46.308" offset="288580">You mean, Mr. Gordon inadequate even under preponderance statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="49.251" stopTime="395.739">
            <label>Mr. Charles Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="49.251" offset="300387">Yes, under any criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.560" offset="317628">In totality, we believe the evidence on the record in this case would most likely satisfy any criterion of persuasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.833" offset="362663">The evidence is summarized for the Court’s information, that’s pages 2 to 6 of our Brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.614" offset="389831">Briefly, it is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.661" offset="402056">First, there is a United States passport which was issued to one Samuel Levine in June of 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.845" offset="446777">Now, thoughout the proceedings, petitioner has not denied, and yesterday I heard his counsel conceived that petitioner’s photograph appears on this passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.475" offset="501321">A witness, Samuel Robinski was called and he said, “Yes, I’m a friend of petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.962" offset="527235">That is his photograph on the passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.957" offset="539251">Petitioner asked me to go with him to the passport office and to appear as a witness on his unidentified witness on his behalf” and he said, “I signed my name ‘Robinski’ to that passport and that’s petitioner’s photograph on the passport”.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.217" offset="612289">Moreover, the identifying data on the passport correspond with petitioner’s identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.138" offset="639875">For example, he has a scar on the back of his right hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.383" offset="656906">At the hearing, he was asked to show his hand, has a scar on the back of his right hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.584" offset="673729">The passport shows a scar on the back of his right hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.775" offset="690448">Next, there are documents which include notations on the passport itself which show that this passport was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.055" offset="735587">First, there is a visa by the French Consul General in New York; couple of days after the issuance of the passport, a Visa for the holder of the passport to go to France.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.011" offset="787414">Then there was a notation on the passport that the holder of the passport was admitted by the immigration authorities in France, a couple of days -- a few days later when the boat ducked.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.084" offset="831718">Then, there is a notation on the passport that in December of 1938, the holder of that passport again used it.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.837" offset="874768">He presented that to the American Consular authorities in Barcelona and asked them to approve it for his coming to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.835" offset="914683">Then, there are document, additional documents, the American Consulate in France show that a number of persons had arrived in France and these were expected to being persons who were using that passport to Spain.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.756" offset="986363">Among them is less than the name of Samuel Levine And, finally, on the passport itself there was a stamp by the immigration service, showing that the holder of this passport, Samuel Levine, was admitted to the United States under that name in December of 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.508" offset="1073403">Now, we add to that the testimony of witness Morrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.728" offset="1090330">This is cumulative.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.305" offset="1096600">This is supporting evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.621" offset="1101824">This in itself, is I say is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.120" offset="1111855">But added to the other evidence, it is quite impressive.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.752" offset="1126379">Now something about Mr. Morrow, this, as the Court indicated and counsel agreed yesterday, this is not a professional witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.263" offset="1156472">This is a reporter for the New York Times, a man who was worth as his report for over 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.139" offset="1183953">He himself pored in Spain and we located him after some diligent gun showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.741" offset="1214360">We found out that this person had been in Spain.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.009" offset="1223450">We asked him, “Do you remember this person?”</text>
            <text syncTime="284.222" offset="1240273">We showed this photograph.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.144" offset="1247901">Well, he said, “I can’t say I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.420" offset="1257096">That photograph is vaguely familiar to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.885" offset="1266918">I can’t say I don’t”.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.807" offset="1274650">“Do you remember the name ‘Sam or Samuel Levine?”</text>
            <text syncTime="296.912" offset="1291055">“That rings a bell on my mind but I can’t say.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.378" offset="1304848">I think there was some such fellow but I can’t say.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.870" offset="1318849">He was asked, “Would you want to look at the person we have in mind and see if that will refresh your recollection?”</text>
            <text syncTime="311.180" offset="1348106">He said, “I’d be glad to”.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.723" offset="1358242">So in one day when there was a hearing, unknown to the petitioner, Mr. Morrow this non-professional public expert individual, “This is the only interest, who has been telling the truth”, he said, went to the immigration office and sat down there in the lobby and observed the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.456" offset="1437236">And after this observation for now, “Yes”, he said “I remember now.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.739" offset="1454373">This is the Sam Levine that served with me in the Spanish Loyalist forces in Spain”.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.248" offset="1484361">He says, “I remember it too that he went back with me on the S.S. Ausonia, with the group of his -- who sailed from Spain back to the United States as the Loyalist were losing the war in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.531" offset="1541517">And, I remember he was on the ship at that time”.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.582" offset="1553742">Now I suggest that on the face of this record, the petitioner’s failure to offer any of these, none at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.971" offset="1587284">He didn’t testify, he didn’t produce any witnesses, could’ve produced document possibly, he could’ve produced witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.493" offset="1613302">He said nothing; he testified to nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.171" offset="1628035">He just sat there and did not open his mouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.275" offset="1640469">Now, he is the person who knew the facts; he is the person that best knew the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.847" offset="1662725">And, added to this record and on the face of this record, I think his silence is also significant.</text>
