            <text syncTime="31.639" offset="229961">This case involves the legal status of an order of the Federal Trade Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.445" offset="265174">The order in question was issued in January of 1959 and the date is important here, issued upon the consent of the respondent Jantzen.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.581" offset="329644">In substance the order directed the Jantzen to cease-and-desist from further discrimination in advertising and promotional allowances granted its customers, a form of discrimination covered by Section 2(d) of the Clayton Act.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="76.326" offset="408639">Was this a consent?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="77.869" stopTime="195.843">
            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="77.869" offset="414804">Yes Your Honor it was a consent order.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.727" offset="430268">And the only statutory problem which is here results from the fact that later in that same year 1959, specifically in July, the Clayton Act was amended so as to provide both new and strengthened methods of enforcement of cease-and-desist orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.299" offset="540609">Now respondent contends and the Ninth Circuit has agreed that a practical consequence albeit an inadvertent one of this amendment was to make the preexisting January 1959 order wholly unenforceable and it consequently acknowledged violations of this 1959 order, violations which were found some years later in 1964 cannot be reached through the 1959 cease-and-desist order.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.941" offset="711137">We urge of course that this was not an intended result, a point on which there appears to be little if any basis for dispute and that it is not a result which is required by the amendatory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.011" offset="783444">We make the further I would say complementary argument that if the amendment should be read as creating a gap and leaving this former order unenforceable, then we say alternatively that gap would be filled by the general savings statute 1 USC 109.</text>

            <text syncTime="205.051" offset="923564">I expected parochial language it said perhaps inadvertent.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.130" offset="939865">I am going to argue on the basis of the legislative history and that plainly Congress thought it was protecting and strengthening the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.865" offset="982810">It also made reference in the committee report which is printed as an appendix to the government's brief to numerous compliance investigations which the commission had underway and there's not a whisper in the entire history that Congress thought it was going to make any orders unenforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.399" offset="1076955">So I think there is little basis at least for any suggestion that Congress thought this result was going to fallout.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.987" offset="1123349">I might note incidentally that the Second Circuit has reasonable come out in direct opposition to the conclusion reached by the Ninth Circuit in this case and that in earlier -- at an earlier date the District of Colombia Circuit had indicated although that precise issue was not before it for a decision that it excepted the commission's view which I shall explain as I go along that the old orders continue to be enforced by that.</text>

          <turn speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="293.015" stopTime="892.042">
            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="293.015" offset="1275382">We have printed it since it's not available in the reports in the supplemental memorandum that Your Honor should have.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.665" offset="1310072">Now before I attempt to develop our arguments, let me seek if I may to clarify the issue by recalling to Your Honors' the pre-1959 procedures and then comparing them to the procedures for judicial review and enforcement as provided in 1959 by the so called Finality Act of 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.014" offset="1423444">Now prior to that year, Clayton Act orders, cease and desist orders could come before the Court of Appeals in one of two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.660" offset="1474017">The party subject to the order could bring a review proceeding to set it aside or to modify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.841" offset="1502751">There was no period of limitations prior to 1959 so that the order might stand for years and then ultimately a review proceeding might be instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.863" offset="1550817">The next paragraph of the old statute provided that the commission for its part could go to the Court of Appeals in order to seek enforcement, but it was only entitled to enforcement if it could show two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.377" offset="1624900">First that it's cease and desist order was valid and second that its order had been violated since it had been issued, in other words it had to show a post order violation, a second act.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.579" offset="1689684">Sanctions attached only if an order of enforcement was obtained and a third violation thereafter shown at which point of course the contempt power of Court of Appeals would be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.940" offset="1759169">Now as I've indicated accordingly there might be -- there might have been under the 1953 -- pre-1959 procedures two proceedings in the Court of Appeals preliminary to a decree enforcing the commission's order, the one proceeding by the responded company seeking review of the order, the other proceeding by the commission seeking enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.335" offset="1876720">A ruling by the Court of Appeals on a respondent's appeal that the order was valid did not automatically carry enforcement with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.357" offset="1924786">Indeed this Court made it clear in the old Ruberoid decision that even if a commission order was affirmed that enforcement would not follow unless in addition violation, post order violation was shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.800" offset="2010572">Now these old procedures as I've outlined initially applied both to orders issued under the Clayton Act and to orders issued under the Federal Trade Commission Act, both of which statutes of course were roughly contemporaneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.933" offset="2083088">They were cumbersome and in 1938 Congress changed them so far as cease and desist orders issued under the Federal Trade Commission Act were concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.297" offset="2140557">That was done by the so called Wheeler-Lea Amendments and in large part though not in toto, the Finality Act of 1959 or Clayton Act orders what the Wheeler-Lea Amendments had done in 1938 for Federal Trade Commission Act orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.305" offset="2228642">And the new procedures brought into the law by Wheeler-Lea can be simply stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.028" offset="2255496">It provided that if an order issued under the Trade Commission Act was not appealed within 60 days, it would become final.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.390" offset="2296978">If it were appealed within that 60-day period, it would become final upon the conclusion of the review proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.581" offset="2337729">Under this scheme, the Wheeler-Lea scheme final orders were equipped with teeth.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.837" offset="2366673">Violation of any such final order would carry civil penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.463" offset="2389243">Now there were numerous cease and desist orders outstanding when the Wheeler-Lea Amendment was passed too and the happily the Wheeler-Lea amendment made some specific provision for that which the statute, we are dealing with today did not make.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.594" offset="2465729">Wheeler-Lea in a separate section said that all Federal Trade Commission Act orders which had not already been taken to the Courts would become final if the private party affected by that order did not seek judicial review within 60 days of the enactment of the new enforcement procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.295" offset="2572518">And as a result all Federal Trade Commission Act orders would become final and self executing either by the failure of the party to seek judicial review within the 60 days allowed by the statute or if he did seek review by his failure to sustain it's challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.293" offset="2664573">Now, the commission sought similar legislation in relation to Clayton Act cease-and-desist orders over a period of years and various bills differing somewhat in their details were sporadically introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.066" offset="2727685">It was not until 1959 that the comparable legislation was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.917" offset="2751091">I say comparable because there are some differences and those differences do concern us in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.259" offset="2780453">First very briefly as to the similarities; the Finality Act of 1959 like the Wheeler-Lea Amendments upon which it was patterned, substituted new, review and enforcement procedures for the old.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.072" offset="2855685">Just like Wheeler-Lea it provided that the Clayton Act orders would become final 60-days after service upon the respondent company unless judicial review were sought and further of course if review were thought they would become final to the extent sustained upon the completion of the review proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.974" offset="2963310">Again like Wheeler-Lea, it provided that final Clayton Act orders would be self executing and would carry penalties also that they might be imports through the injunction process.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.787" offset="3022555">In short then so for as Clayton Act orders issued after July 1959 are concerned one may say that the Wheeler-Lea and the Clayton Act and the Finality Act procedures are for all practical purpose is same.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.925" offset="3107088">Now Wheeler-Lea as I indicated earlier contained this separate section which provided in substance that in the case of an already outstanding order the respondent would have 60 days to go to Court and failing that the order would become final.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.844" offset="3182738">The Finality Act which was Senator Sparkman's Senate Bill enacted in the law, adopted a different approach for already outstanding orders than it adopted cease-and-desist orders thereafter to be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.033" offset="3259538">Section 2 of the Finality Act which appears at page 39 in the government's brief, states that the review and enforcement procedures provided by the new statute and the amendments made by Section 1 shall have no application to any proceedings initiated before the date of enactment of this Act, and then it goes on, that each such proceeding shall be governed by the provisions of such section as they existed on the day preceding the date of enactment of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.731" offset="3446262">Thus the statute tells us quite explicitly that if a Court of Appeals proceeding involving the cease-and-desist order in this case had been pending, when the Finality Act was passed in July 1959 that the old procedures would govern and that the commission could seek enforcement in the case of post order violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.808" offset="3554617">What the statute fails to tell us in terms, is what procedures are to govern cease-and-desist orders issued prior to July of 1959, in relation to which no proceeding was pending in the Court of Appeals as of July 1959 and that of course is the factual situation that we have in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="897.955" offset="3695156">-– substituted new review and enforcement procedures for the old and that these were prospective in their operation, they were going to govern all orders thereafter issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.551" offset="3757537">The statute also explicitly provided that in respect of any proceeding that was already in Court, the earlier pre 1959 procedures would govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.344" offset="3828799">Jantzen argues the Congress repealed the old provisions except in so for as it enacted an explicit savings provision and that in consequence there is a gap because although Congress provided for the continuance of the old methods of enforcement in respect to cases already pending in Court, it did not in terms provide any method of enforcement in respect of pre-1959 cease-and-desist orders which had not yet been taken to Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.166" offset="4016044">It seems hardly likely that Congress engaged as this Congress was in urging of sponsor in strengthening and protecting the act would have knowingly discarded the vast majority of the cease-and-desist orders and cast them in limbo making them a wholly unenforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.612" offset="4121788">In fact when the 1959 legislation was passed, there were some 440 Clayton Act cease-and-desist orders outstanding, some 50 of which have been affirmed or enforced and in additional 11 then pending on review in the Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.733" offset="4226278">The respondent's argument would mean that the remaining 379 orders with many of them entered after protracted and strenuously contested proceedings would be unenforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.954" offset="4311228">I think it's been conceivable that Congress would have knowingly discarded this large number of orders without even a whisper in the entire legislative history and there is none of this is what it was about or this is what it intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.697" offset="4410180">I think it also offends the commonsense considerably to suppose that Congress would make explicit provision for commission of enforcement of an order which is then being challenged in the courts but makes no allowance whatever for the commission to enforce an order which has not even been questioned, but yet that would be the consequence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1148.767" offset="4698467">As I said both those circuits have concluded that the obvious purpose was to make the new provisions prospective and those Courts have concluded that the statute can fairly be read in light of it's obvious purpose as repealing the old provisions for enforcement only and respect of orders thereafter issued by the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.032" offset="4831483">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held has shortly after the Finality Act was passed in its Sperry Rand case that the new statute was prospective only and that all pre-1959 orders where to be enforced by the old statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.359" offset="4908805">Judge Fayes suggested in that opinion that the explanation of the rather limited language used the reference only to cases pending in the courts may have been prompted by the dealing on the part of Congress that otherwise some doubts might exist about proceedings which were in litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.465" offset="5009220">In all events the commission duly advised as a result of the District of Columbia Circuit litigation that the new statute was prospective only directed an investigation and I'm now returning to the particulars of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.230" offset="5080273">In 1964 to determine whether respondent Jantzen was in compliance with the old 1959 order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.467" offset="5125204">Jantzen acknowledged in that commission proceeding that it had violated the order and indeed it stipulated two, three instances of violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.033" offset="5179538">The commission thereupon filed a petition for a court order adjoining compliance and at that point Jantzen objected that the court was without jurisdiction because on a strictly literal reading of the statute one might say there was a gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.248" offset="5296358">I've indicated already I think that we believe the other circuits that have viewed this matter are correct in believing that one may read into this language a continuation of the statute not only for pending cases, but for all of cases including those in which the respondent hadn't even challenged the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.592" offset="5405759">This brings me and I shall treat it only very briefly to the alternative argument which we think is a sound one if there is any -- if the Court finds occasion to reach it and that is the argument that if the Finality Act were read as leaving a gap, it seems to us that the general saving statute would properly be invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.592" offset="5533759">That statute says in substance that the repeal of statutory provisions shall not release any liability incurred under the old law, unless the repealing act shall so expressly provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.541" offset="5609514">Now respondent answers that contention with this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.261" offset="5636368">It's says that it had no liability in July 1959 when the Finality Act was passed because at that point it had not yet violated the commission's cease-and-desist order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.475" offset="5705226">Now we would agree that in July of 1959 there was no fixed liability in the sense of an applicable sanction or an approved penalty or a liability for a sum certain, but we would argue that liability is satisfied by the very entry of a cease and desist order even though any penalty would be dependent upon the future event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.939" offset="5859140">And in a number of labor board cases which have been decided by the Courts of Appeals that an analogous question has arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.635" offset="5909922">The cases I refer to are cases in which the labor board issued a cease and desist order under the Wagner Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.348" offset="5948792">Before the order was judicially enforced, the provisions of the Wagner Act under which the order had been promulgated was superseded by provisions of Taft-Hartley, yet in those cases the Courts of Appeals concluded that a administrative cease and desist order is a liability within the meaning of the Savings Statute even though there is no sanction until the order, the administrative order has been judicially enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.819" offset="6098631">Now that brings me finally to respondent's suggestion, a point to which Mr. Justice Harlan adverted a moment ago, a suggestion that the commission does not need the old remedy for old orders because when there is a violation, it can bring a new complaint and get the benefit upon it's finding a violation of the new procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.463" offset="6269262">Now I agree, I think the commission probably agrees that there may well be cases in which it would be fully as expeditious to start a new case as it would be to pursue the old one and one of the commissioners has strongly questioned that as being of that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.031" offset="6371453">I should like to stress that nothing I have suggested would prevent the commission from pursuing its options in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.586" offset="6413667">Quite the contrary my only point is that it should have the option, that Congress has left it the option to enforce its old orders as well as to bring new cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.634" offset="6465912">And the commission is of the view that there are at least two situations in which it maybe considerably more difficult to prove the basis of a new cease and desist order than it would be to establish a violation of an outstanding order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.986" offset="6555355">But one thing a cease and desist order may and it sometimes does direct a respondent to refrain from acts which are not in and of themselves unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.524" offset="6609481">Once a violation has been proved, an administrative agency or a court of equity may be empowered to take necessary steps to prevent a repetition and sweep more broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.804" offset="6674578">As this Court put it in the National Led case a known violator may expect some fencing in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.882" offset="6718882">A second led is not invariably necessary in an enforcement proceeding to litigate all of the issues which would or might have to be litigated in a brand new proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.929" offset="6791084">Thus the record in the earlier administrative proceeding, the proceeding leading to the initial cease and desist order may suffice in the violation proceeding to dispose of particular elements in the case at that second stage and indeed this Court's Morton Salt and Ruberoid opinions are both quite suggestive as to that possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.892" offset="6926921">In short we think that there are circumstances in which the commission may find that enforcing old orders rather than instituting new proceedings will be to its advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.804" offset="6994631">When it will follow up an old order rather than institute a new case it seems to us is a matter for the commission itself rather than for the courts to attempt to decide, but our point here is simply the Congress has reviewed the matter has not closed the door upon the enforcement of pre-1959 order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1758.037" offset="7135483">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.965" offset="7155231">Our point here is that Congress has made it quite clear what it was doing in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.726" offset="7190235">The commission recognized that at that time and to some extent the commission recognizes it today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.668" offset="7218030">When this proceeding that's now before the Court and we want to if we can to invite your attention to this proceeding as dramatically as we can and not some other case that might come up some day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.564" offset="7273618">This proceeding when it was initiated in the summer of 1964, if the Federal Trade Commission at that time and now makes available a very handy government printing office publication containing it's rules and containing various other statutes that the commission has responsibility to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.139" offset="7375914">And if anyone in the summer of '64 or anytime since August 1963 looks at the copy of the Clayton Act that's printed in this publication, he doesn't find any of these provisions that the government tried to tell the Court of Appeals in San Francisco are those that their petition is filed under.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.960" offset="7467238">He looks in here and here is Section 11 of the Clayton Act as it now appears in the United States code and has consistently appeared United States code each time anybody considered it since 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.275" offset="7536515">Now there is a clue in this publication and incidentally I went by there on the way up to Court this morning and asked simply for a slip copy of the Clayton Act, the legal public record section of Federal Trade Commission and it's identical to what I'm attempting to show right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.603" offset="7613733">The same thing, the statute as it appears in the United States code with a footnote then at the end of Sub Section B of Section 11 and there that footnote says that there was this amendment in 1959 Public Law 86-107 which re-designated the first two sub-paragraphs of Section 11 of the Clayton Act and then amended third, fourth, fifth, six and so on providing this procedure which Mr. Spritzer has carefully laid out is the current method for enforcement of Clayton Act orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.088" offset="7763675">It says that there was this amendment and then it goes on to say paraphrasing Section 2 of the 1959 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.650" offset="7793977">The amendment so made do not apply to any proceeding initiated before the date of enactment of that Act under the third or fourth paragraph of Section 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.035" offset="7835564">Now I don't know whether it was or I won't question anybody's motivation but the fact is that the counsel continually referred to that second section of the Finality Act of 1959 as referring only to pending cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.009" offset="7931382">That's just not correct and the commission lays it out in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.946" offset="7951130">That second section said that, shall – these amendments shall have no application to any proceeding initiated under the third or fourth paragraph and the third paragraph of the old Section 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.738" offset="8002330">The old Section 11, the third paragraph was reviewed, it was enforcement proceedings and the fourth paragraph was review proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.574" offset="8045693">So that let's not have the Court be confused as to what the Finality Act of 1959 on its face did. it specifically preserved any -- the old method of procedure for any proceedings for review or enforcement previously initiated and I would suggest that, that means all of the significant cases or close to all of them and I will come to that if I may, but for instance don't have this misunderstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.605" offset="8177768">If in 1955, this Court or a Court of Appeals reviewed and affirmed an old Federal Trade Commission Clayton Act order this 1959 Act on its face preserves that specific method of enforcement and we are not contending that it doesn't and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is not saying that it doesn't, those are totally unaffected by the Ninth Circuit's decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.607" offset="8289782">Now to go on then as to what the Federal Trade Commission, its publication tells you about this, they tell you about the Section 2 and they each such proceeding that is, those were that was a review or enforcement proceeding previously initiated continues to be governed by the provisions of such section as they existed on the day proceeding the date of enactment of public law 86-107.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.007" offset="8387375">Now you don't find anywhere else unless I am mistaken in the commission's rules or its publications any clue that they are going to tend to regard some other provisions of law which have been repealed as still in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.656" offset="8482043">The handling -- the code of files of the U.S. Code didn't do the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.476" offset="8501269">The Court will recognize that the U.S. code as prima facie that's the law here and we submit then that that's lesser some terribly persuasive reason as to why that isn't the law and that just settles the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3372.329" offset="13592639">I see my time is supposed to be up and I would like if I may just try to bring the attention back to this one question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.036" offset="13651466">If the government's argument of statutory construction here what statute is it arguing should be construed and what words in what statute should be construed in what way to come out with any result other than the result reached by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.965" offset="13719280">I submit that question as I never even been hinted at in any of the government's briefs or oral arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.826" offset="13742686">Secondly I do want to try to comeback to the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.185" offset="13760136">The Second Circuit we submit simply misunderstood this, the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.283" offset="13776541">First of all they had a case before, the Second Circuit had a case before it in which the terms of section two of the 1959 act explicitly applied and they said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.775" offset="13818441">And then they went on gratuitously to state that they didn't like what the Ninth Circuit did here because and they don't say what they would, they don't say how they would construe the statute otherwise they just say we don't like this result because it disregards two factors and then the two factors they state are simply not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.992" offset="13899316">They misunderstood the, in the sense of the non-enforceability of the orders issued prior 1959 no matter which methods or procedure apply and they went on just to conclude that well the Ninth Circuit opinion is somehow inconsistent with some vague general intention of Congress and we submit to you that that's not correct, that's not, they didn't need to do that and they were wrong in doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.971" offset="14019271">And as to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia those cases there, question wasn't before them at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.992" offset="14039333">In those cases the court was simply reviewing the commission's attempt by blanket [Voice Overlap] to give automatic penalty within 60 days of the passage of the 1959 act to all lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.833" offset="14086666">And actually counsel in that case was not trying to take on an added burden when they said the commission can't do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.665" offset="14110072">Now the commission when that -- there was no petition for certiorari from those DC cases and what the commission has done here is it attempted to blanket in all these old orders in a way that that the contrast between the Wheeler-Lea amendments and the 1959 amendments just simply wouldn't permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.053" offset="14179558">It was rebuffed on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.867" offset="14186872">Rather than go back to Congress they then come along at some later year and try to get the courts now to just straighten and rewrite the 1959 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.309" offset="14224593">Now why are 1959 act and why was it written that way, for one thing we submit because the commission at that time didn't point out any of these possible horribles that it's arguing now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.836" offset="14262732">If you look inside the Keith Travis (ph) committee reports, it's clear that the understanding of that committee was you had approved three violations of law to achieve anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.943" offset="14299094">I see my time is up.</text>
