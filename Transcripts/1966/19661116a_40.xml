            <text syncTime="38.047" offset="255561">Mr Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.428" offset="269040">The petitioner in this case is a 34-year-old female who married an American soldier while he was stationed in Germany in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.281" offset="308537">They had one child while they were living together in Germany.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.621" offset="325883">The petitioner's husband in return from Germany to Harlan County, Kentucky which was his parents home and left the petitioner and their infant child in Germany for a period of approximately a year-and-a-half.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.479" offset="385337">After that time, the petitioner and the child came over to the United States and they moved to Harlan, Kentucky with her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.704" offset="430164">They resided there for approximately six months and then move to Dayton, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.755" offset="450435">About four months after that, which was sometime in August of 1956, they had a second child that was born approximately four months premature.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.756" offset="498395">About four months after that which would be somewhere around December, the petitioner got into an argument with her husband, he took her and put her on a bus and shipped her off to Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.055" offset="555551">She turned around as soon as she got there after borrowing money from a friend to get back, arrived in Dayton, Ohio and found that her husband had taken their two children and moved back to the family homestead in Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.357" offset="612812">She was without funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.210" offset="620231">She couldn't speak English at the time and then she went to work 5&amp;10 Cent store.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.505" offset="645413">After that, she worked in a 5&amp;10 Cent store for approximately three months and then she went to work as a waitress in a restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.058" offset="683656">Soon after she went to work, she received a telephone call from her husband who is in Kentucky, stating that their son who at that time was about four months old -- no, it would have been about seven months old was in dire need of a brain operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.738" offset="746350">She was told by her husband that the child could not have the operation unless he had $300.00 that he had no Blue Cross and the hospital refused to operate on the child unless she had the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.056" offset="803610">She told her husband that she had no way of getting the money and he told her, “If you're a mother enough, you'll know how to get it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="184.898" offset="843003">At this time, the petitioner testified that she was told and she did believe that if she did not get the money, the child would die as a result of this because she could -- because the child would not have an operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.963" offset="899218">The next day, a vacuum cleaner salesman came to the door to sell her a vacuum cleaner, she said, I'm sorry I can't afford a vacuum and told her, she told him the sad story.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.711" offset="954180">He said, well, I know how I can get you the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.539" offset="969540">He left and came back some time later with another man and a bottle of liquor, they took some pictures of her and apparently, men started coming to her apartment the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.726" offset="1030248">The petitioner testified that she continued to engage from that point for approximately two months in acts of prostitution until she had repaid the $300.00 that she got from this vacuum cleaner salesman by the name of Tom Wally.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.550" offset="1105586">After that, she tried terminating the arrangement with him when she repaid him.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.253" offset="1124394">He threatened to turn it over to the police and the immigration authorities even in view of that, she left Dayton approximately two weeks later and went to Knoxville, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.212" offset="1164204">This two-month period of time as far as we can determine is approximately from April 1 until June 1 of 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.942" offset="1207150">She then went approximately June 1, 1957 to Knoxville, Tennessee and remained there until the 4th of July of 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.430" offset="1249050">On the 4th of July, a friend of the petitioners drove down from Dayton, Ohio, picked the petitioner up and brought her back and the petitioner resided with this lady from the 4th of July of ‘57 until September of ‘57 in one place and then they move above the place where the petitioner was working in September ‘57.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.081" offset="1347688">In October of 1957, a Mr. Emercon was eating dinner in the restaurant where the petitioner was working and Mr. Emercon was told by his dinner companion not in the presence of the petitioner that the petitioner was quote “in the business”.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.190" offset="1432116">This is in October of 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.020" offset="1451447">Mr. Emercon then met the petitioner that evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.873" offset="1466911">He went to the petitioner's apartment, they talked at great length.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.414" offset="1484988">She told him this whole story.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.026" offset="1495437">He explained to her what she had been doing and everything about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="677.578" offset="2813680">Now, as far as the first period of time is concerned, the Board of Immigration Appeals stated that even if accepting duress as a defense, we find that the petitioner did engage in acts of prostitution after June 1, 1957 so we're concerned in this case with the second period of time with one, did she in fact engaged in acts of prostitution after June 1, 1957?</text>

            <text syncTime="2638.098" offset="10655744">Since the facts here are obviously subcritical, I would like to briefly consider the record before returning to the legal arguments made by the petitioner and raised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.201" offset="10696182">I should note that we take a radically different view of the record and the facts here than does the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.473" offset="10717288">Indeed, if the record shows the facts as petitioner feels that it does, I think the Government wouldn't be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.310" offset="10756577">One thing upon which the parties do agree here, however, is that the record is rather confused one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.230" offset="10784266">We agree with this and would like to note that much of the confusion ever resulted from a number in inconsistencies in petitioner's own testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.689" offset="10818121">Indeed, as the counsel of petitioner noted that she frankly admitted that she changed her story at one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.782" offset="10846542">There is a great bit of confusion about dates here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.794" offset="10862529">The petitioner has now developed what appears to be a rather plausible handling of this problem of dates which has the effect of telescoping the time of her admitted involvement in prostitution insofar as it's possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.037" offset="10911535">On the other hand, the special inquiry officer who of course observed the witnesses and was in the best position to determine their credibility found the facts to be quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.608" offset="10949778">After considering the testimony and the demeanor of the witnesses and all the surrounding circumstances, he arrived in what we feel to be a most plausible and probably accurate resolution of this problem of confusion particularly as to dates which one finds in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.390" offset="11008920">His finding that petitioner's engagement in prostitution whatever the circumstances of its commencement continued until late 1958 and not 1957 is we feel amply supported in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.883" offset="11058866">The petitioner's trip in Knoxville which was referred to previously according to her own witness Mrs. Jackson occurred in 1958 and not 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.223" offset="11100244">The petitioner's husband as shown by the record in the Kentucky Court and the probative custody proceeding, his death occurred in July of 1958 or 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.597" offset="11145801">The petitioner herself stated at one point that she received “gifts” of money from that engaging and of course subsequent to learning of her husband's death some six months after he has been killed and at an apartment by the way that she moved to only according to her testimony after the Knoxville trip.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.757" offset="11226363">Other testimony we feel also confirms the findings as to dates reached by the special inquiry officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.177" offset="11252067">But even apart from his findings, once here in fact that stands out clearly from the record is that petitioner repeatedly and consistently tied the determination of her engagement in prostitution to her meeting this Mr. Anthony Emercon whether that occurred in late 1958 or as early as late 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.836" offset="11330748">In the circumstances of Emercon as becoming acquainted with petitioner, confirmed and we think that she continued to engage in prostitution at least at the very least until meeting him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.985" offset="11375261">He was told by a friend who said that he had relations with her for money that she was “in the business”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.204" offset="11400234">Now, we know this is hearsay and so did everybody below but hearsay is generally admissible in administrative proceedings and it seems to me that there are some real question here as to whether it might not have been admissible judicially under an exception to the hearsay rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.106" offset="11463764">But anyhow, he went to her apartment for the purpose--</text>

            <text syncTime="2855.299" offset="11524577">I think it's probative because I don't think people generally run around deporting out women and saying things like this about them if there isn't some substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.351" offset="11568776">Emercon went to her apartment as the record shows for the purpose of having relations with her although he states that he could not go through with it but left $10.00 anyhow or probably not an outstanding alone to prove that she was then engaging to prostitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.533" offset="11625514">This evidence we feel tends to strongly corroborate that her admitted activity continued at least until she met this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.524" offset="11653517">At the earliest under any view of the record, she met him in October of 1957 at least six months after the time that she herself admits that the prostitution started.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.235" offset="11700328">The inference is most favorable to her engaged in men and assuming that her prostitution started in April and not February.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.200" offset="11728123">She once gave an affidavit saying that it started in February.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.962" offset="11747244">The evidence still showed an engagement of prostitution for some six months at the very least.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.325" offset="11764694">Only two months of which are accounted for by the alleged arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.813" offset="11782666">She now said the Knoxville trip intervened but as the special inquiry also found it's quite likely that that trip did not occur until 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.870" offset="11818820">She once stated that she spent three months in Knoxville but under a present view of what happened, she could have been there no longer than several weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.878" offset="11846928">She started working for the vacuum cleaner salesman in April, continued for two months, wanted to quit but continued for another two weeks and then went to Knoxville to get away returning on some July 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.467" offset="11897292">Parenthetically, her early explanation of why she went to Knoxville that Mr. Wally asked her to go there to practice prostitution and that she was evicted from her apartment because another girl used it for purposes of prostitution it seems to us more possible just as it seems more likely that the Knoxville trip did not occurred in 198 and that she had engaged in prostitution from early ‘57 until sometime late ‘58.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.681" offset="12002095">In any event, she tied the end of her prostitution to meeting Emercon over and over again as the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.029" offset="12031457">Under any view of the testimony, this could not have occurred until late 1957 outside of the period of the alleged duressthus we feel the Government showed she had engaged to prostitution even apart from the period of alleged duressfor substantial period of time in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.100" offset="12111809">In addition, the petitioner was arrested for prostitution in early 1959, no charges were dropped and Emercon gave a statement to the police at that time that she was a prostitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.078" offset="12159666">Statement which she says was untrue and was given to help her retain custody of her daughter.</text>

            <text syncTime="3048.636" offset="12297906">Thus, we feel, there's at least some evidence in the record that her engagement continued into 1959 even in that so far in two months that she admits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.498" offset="12341373">Now, in response principally, Mr Chief Justice, to your question, her duress defense, whatever it's merits simply doesn't cover the ration of proven engagement in prostitution and as I stated contrary to her session the factfinders here did not accepted duress offense as true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.748" offset="12422353">Rather as we view their opinions they found it unnecessary to reach those questions or to decide whether her story should be believed and she was deportable for having engaged in prostitution outside of the period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.223" offset="12476270">Now, as to an affirmative defense of duress, whoever had the burden of proceeding at the burden on proof seems to ask is not relevant here because the question simply never arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.668" offset="12526007">Even assuming that the Government had the ultimate burden of proof once the defense such as this was properly raised, that burden never arose here because her evidence that she produced didn't relate wasn't coextensive with the period of her engagement in prostitution and therefore, the prima facie case which deserve as it made out was not refuted and they did not need to rebut that evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3157.806" offset="12734568">In some cases, they'll have the burden of -- ultimate burden of proof on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.045" offset="12759542">Now, here, all that I'm saying is this question is -- simply never arose here because even though she did produce some evidence of what she says relates to duress, the Government did not need to attempt to rebut that evidence if it's case was based upon -- could be based upon other evidence in the record, evidence apart from the period of alleged duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.089" offset="12879705">As a matter of fact with respect to the factfinders' view of her story, it seems to us clear that have they found it necessary to pass on the variety of the story, neither the special inquiry officer nor the Board of Immigration Appeals would have believed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.099" offset="12943757">The special inquiry officer founded a hard story to believe and the Board of Immigration Appeals stated that it was a bizarre story.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.638" offset="12973955">But the Board of Immigration Appeals echoing special inquiry officer stated, even if the respondent's story is to be believed, even it be considered circumstances under which she entered the practice prostitution may have amounted to duress, nevertheless the continuance of the practice until at least 1957, late 1957 is not explained cannot be dependent on the ground of duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.483" offset="13069354">Now, just several words about the adequacy of duress defense itself, it seems to me that it's a rather unusual and highly attenuated one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.406" offset="13108955">It's an attempt to justify on the grounds principally of economic duress affirmative misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.501" offset="13137377">Now, we now concede that in some limited circumstances there maybe an adequate defense of duress under such condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.591" offset="13169768">The courts have generally carefully scrutinized such alleged duress defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.091" offset="13191711">And I think sociologist would probably tell us that most prostitution is engaged in under some economic duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.875" offset="13222849">Now, supposed instead of deciding to engage in prostitution, petitioner decided in order to get this money that she was going to rob a bank or forge a check.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.389" offset="13260884">I think that she would be hard pressed to maintain that the circumstances were suppression to justify her activity if it later was brought a proceeding which later brought against deport.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.400" offset="13308949">Falsely analyzed therefore we've been able to hear duress defense had it been reached and if you reach it theoretically it's on its face legally inadequate even if her story is believed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.924" offset="13355029">Her reliance on the Board of Immigration Appeals case in which the duress defense was accepted seems to us wide in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.960" offset="13383241">That case was a rather unusual one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.789" offset="13390555">The girl there was 17 years of age, she was held in custody and threatened with harm that she didn't brought through with the prostitution, tried to escape unsuccessfully and was caught continued with her engagement only until she could get away and a special inquiry officer there specifically stated that he found her story completely credible and believable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3952.480" offset="15913253">Mr. Forer.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph Forer</label>
            <text syncTime="3954.149" offset="15919940">Mr Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3958.067" offset="15935613">This is a deportation case in which the question is what is the standard of proof which the Immigration and Naturalization Service must satisfy when it seeks to approve the deportability of a resident alien?</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.114" offset="16007816">The petitioner, Joseph Sherman was born in Poland in 1906.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.431" offset="16037073">When he was 14 years old in 1920, he entered the United States as an immigrant with his mother and the rest of his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.093" offset="16079705">43 years later in March 1963 the Immigration Service instituted deportation proceedings against them on the charge that he had re-entered the country on December 20, 1938 without inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4012.951" offset="16155146">Now, in December of 1938 and for that matter beginning with the Immigration Act of 1917 and up until December of 1952, there was a three-year statute of limitations on deportations for entry without inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4033.964" offset="16239261">But in 1952, effective December of 1952, the current Immigration and Nationality Act was enacted and it retroactively removed the statutes of limitations on deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.284" offset="16300492">So the result is that when this proceeding was brought against Mr. Sherman in March 1963 it was brought not only 25 years after his alleged offense of illegal re-entry or re-entry without inspection but also 22 years after that entry if it had occurred had been later rest by a statute of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4074.959" offset="16403205">Now, in the deportation proceeding, the services case rested on two bases of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.991" offset="16443329">The first section of evidence related to a passport, the Service introduced evidence that in June of 1937, the petitioner applied for a United States passport under the false name of Samuel Levine and to his application there was attached his photograph.</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.237" offset="16540296">A few days after the application was made, well, the Service then introduced a passport as a self-proving document which on its face indicates that it was issued a few days after this application was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.639" offset="16605915">This passport is in the name of Samuel Levine and then has affixed to it petitioner's photograph.</text>
            <text syncTime="4133.412" offset="16637053">The record doesn't show to whom that passport was delivered and it doesn't show how it came under the possession of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and it doesn't show what happened to that document between December of 1938 when we last get some idea of its history and the time of the immigration proceedings in 1964 and 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.872" offset="16746872">But the evidence does show that in June of 1937, somebody traveled to Europe on the passport issued to this false Samuel Levine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4172.227" offset="16792325">And on December 20, 1938, somebody entered the United States with the aid of this passport issued to Samuel Levine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4181.880" offset="16830882">The only direct evidence that the petitioner had ever left the country after his original entry was the testimony of a man by the name of Edward Morrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.745" offset="16870379">Morrow had fight with the loyalist forces in Spain during part of 1937 and 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="4200.610" offset="16905801">And he testified at the deportation hearing that he had seen the petitioner also fighting with the loyalist forces in Spain during that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4209.968" offset="16943208">And he also testified, Morrow testified, that when he returned to the United States from Spain by way of France on the Steam-Ship Ausonia which arrived in the United States in December of 1938 that the petitioner was on that boat and he also testified that he knew the petitioner had used the name Samuel Levine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4236.611" offset="17049788">Now, Morrow was testifying 27 years after these alleged events.</text>
            <text syncTime="4243.378" offset="17076851">By his own testimony he had never spoken to the petitioner or to this Samuel Levine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4249.317" offset="17100675">He had never been introduced to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.227" offset="17108302">He had never had direct contact with the person that he claimed was petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4256.615" offset="17129827">As he testified, he had merely seen that person around and in some unexplained fashion, unexplained since he had never been introduced to him or spoken to him, he knew somehow that the man was named Samuel Levine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.772" offset="17190431">Considering that this was 27 years after casual contact, this is on its face and heroic achievement of recollection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4282.559" offset="17233586">Particularly since Morrow's memory was admittedly weak on matters which were much more reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4290.204" offset="17264201">Morrow himself admitted that he was not positive of his identification but said and I quote, “I feel I saw this man in Spain.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4300.886" offset="17306937">But the difficulty with Morrow's testimony goes further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4307.647" offset="17334000">Before the hearing at which Morrow testified, he had been interviewed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.374" offset="17372871">And he was shown this passport photograph of the petitioner which had been on the passport of Samuel Levine and Morrow hadn't been able to identify the petitioner from that photograph.</text>
            <text syncTime="4330.050" offset="17423548">Although obviously that photograph was a better likeness of the petitioner in 1938 and the petitioner himself was in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="4342.247" offset="17472345">Furthermore, when Morrow was interviewed by the Service before the hearing and he was asked about Joseph Sherman or Samuel Levine, he couldn't recall either name much less recalled that this was a person he had seen in Spain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4359.556" offset="17541622">Now, he suggested that perhaps the subject of the passport photograph, he suggested in the interview that perhaps the subject of the passport photograph had been on the ship, the Aquitania on which he, Morrow had sailed from the United States to France in June of 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="4381.383" offset="17628871">But when he testified at the hearing, he reversed them so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4384.780" offset="17642454">This time, he said, the petitioner was not on the voyage to France in June of 1937, the Aquitania.</text>
            <text syncTime="4392.894" offset="17674951">This time he put him on the voyage to the United States from France in December 1938 on the Steam-Ship Ausonia.</text>
            <text syncTime="4402.527" offset="17713507">Now, on this evidence the petitioner was ordered to deport and on review by the Third Circuit -- Second Circuit, I'm sorry, Judges Waterman and Smith with Judge Friendly dissenting, set aside the deportation order and remanded it the Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4423.352" offset="17796786">They held that is the majority of the three-judge panel held that in a deportation case against a long resident alien, such as the petitioner, the Service is obliged to prove its case by the criminal standard of proof that is it must prove the guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.431" offset="17881109">Now, since the standard regularly employed in deportation proceedings by the Board of Immigration Appeals and the special inquiry officer who are the factfinders is that deportability merely has to be proven by a preponderance of reasonable substantial and probative evidence, the panel vacated the deportation order and remanded the case to the Service for reconsideration in the light of the higher standard of beyond the reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4474.122" offset="17999809">Judge Friendly as I said, the Senate, he was sympathetic as he said to the idea of requiring more than a rare preponderance standard in cases of deportation involving the resident aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4488.808" offset="18058637">But he felt and he said that Congress had foreclosed the matter because it had provided a standard of proof for the Service in the administrative deportation hearing by Sections 106 (a) and 242 (b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4509.294" offset="18140557">These two sections provide in substance that administrative findings of deportability are valid and conclusive if and only if these findings are supported by reasonable substantial and probative evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.917" offset="18215058">The two-court majority felt that those two sections had nothing to do with the situation because they related only to a judicial review and were simply the substantial evidence -- the familiar substantial evidence standard for judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="4543.757" offset="18278379">The Government petition for rehearing in the Second Circuit took the case en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="4550.272" offset="18304502">The en banc court reversed the panel and sustained the deportation order adapting Judge Friendly's dissenting opinion of the panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4560.060" offset="18343581">Judges Waterman and Smith dissented that hearing to their original opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4565.961" offset="18367195">Now, as the case was decided in the Second Circuit, the focus was on the applicability of Sections 242 (b) and 106 (a) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.718" offset="18414216">And in our brief, we show and I think we show quite conclusively that these two sections have nothing to do with the case both on the basis of their language, their legislative history and their administrative interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4595.246" offset="18484328">On all three bases, it is clear that these sections merely relate to the standard for judicial review and furthermore they relate not to the burden of proof or the nature of the burden of proof but rather to the quality of the evidence on which the order must be based.</text>
            <text syncTime="4612.402" offset="18552978">Now, as we understand the government's brief, the Government does not contend otherwise, it does not contend that these two sections do apply to the Service at the -- as the setting a standard of proof what they must do with the deportation hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4632.727" offset="18634271">So really, I don't think it is necessary for me to argue now that these two sections are not in terms controlling.</text>

            <text syncTime="4664.133" offset="18759868">All I'm saying is that I don't -- we disagree with that and we think we have demonstrated why the Court of Appeals is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="4672.554" offset="18793618">I'm just saying that I'm just going to rely in my brief for that demonstration to convince you because I don't think that the Government disagrees with us, so I don't want to spend my time on oral argument on a point that at least I think I can just rely on our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4690.086" offset="18863731">Now, the Government does try to draw certain inferences and say that the existence of the judicial review standard has an influence but it seems to us that it is impossible to reason backward from a judicial review standard as to what is the standard for the burden of proof at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4716.742" offset="18970311">In a criminal case, on judicial review the jury's verdict, the finding of guilt has to stand if it is supported by substantial evidence as that's the same substantial evidence test as in administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4732.104" offset="19031751">And yet the standard of proof at the criminal trial is a proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4742.648" offset="19073964">Now, we say that since Congress has not fixed the standard of proof and since at the administrative proceeding and since you can't reason backward from the judicial standard of proof, there simply is no statutory standard of proof and that means that the standard has to be defined by the judicial system and ultimately by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4769.395" offset="19180962">And it is our contention that in the case of resident aliens, for reasons I will go to in a minute, the standards should be either that of the criminal standard of proof beyond the reasonable doubt or at least the standard which the Court has created in denaturalization cases whereby the Government must prove lost citizen -- denaturalization by clear unequivocal and convincing evidence beyond a mere preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.561" offset="19325576">In the denaturalization cases as well as in other kinds of cases such as cancellation of land grants, the Court required compliance with this higher standard of proof that is with the clear unequivocal and convincing evidence standard which is of course a higher standard than the traditional civil standard of preponderance on the grounds that in those cases, denaturalization or cancellation of land patents that those cases involved a revocation of precious rights conferred by governmental action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4848.758" offset="19498402">Now, the same logic obviously applies to deportation cases against resident aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4854.759" offset="19522435">Resident aliens have been granted by governmental action, the precious right to reside and remain in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4863.951" offset="19559215">And with that right they acquire and have been granted a whole complex of other rights which residents of this country have.</text>
            <text syncTime="4873.636" offset="19597876">And aliens who have accepted this right have directed the course of their lives in reliance on the possession of these rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.638" offset="19633925">So that if you take the logic of the cases involving cancellation of other governmental grants, at least the denaturalization standard should be applied to deportation cases involving aliens who have been admitted for permanent resident.</text>
            <text syncTime="4904.620" offset="19721801">But we think that there are still other reasons for requiring a higher standard than the preponderance standard and that these reasons call for adopting the criminal stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4916.937" offset="19771120">And this we think because in several respects in terms of its consequences, its nature, its procedures, deportation cases should for the purposes of the standard of proof be equated with criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4936.147" offset="19847920">Now, deportation is -- of a resident alien is different in any other kind of administrative or civil procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4944.505" offset="19881357">Because that deportation is a deprivation of personal liberty and it is one which in many cases and perhaps most cases is a more drastic deprivation of liberty for the alien and for his family who may be citizens, then the usual term of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4968.041" offset="19975502">Now, whatever the case may be for theoretical constitutional purpose, realistically, the deportation of a resident alien is punishment and as to him, that is punishment, and this case illustrates that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.930" offset="20039137">In this very case, the Government is seeking to uproot a man who has lived in this country since he was a child for 46 of the 60 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4995.895" offset="20086993">His family is here, his friends are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4999.480" offset="20101308">His means of making a livelihood, his skills, his resources and ability to survive, his very ability to communicate and the only language he knows, these depend on his remaining here and the Government is attempting to remove him from this environment and return him to a country from which for all realistic purposes, he's a stranger.</text>

            <text syncTime="5301.531" offset="21309524">So, by the same token, it seemed to us the Court can logically apply the criminal standards of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="5309.273" offset="21340453">Another reason aside from the consequences of deportation are the causes of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5315.980" offset="21367306">If you read the causes which are listed in the Immigration and Nationality Act, they read like a penal code.</text>

            <text syncTime="5349.654" offset="21501994">And what point is the really punitive aspect of deportation as opposed to its ostensible regulatory aspect is that many of the causes, perhaps most of the causes of deportation have no reasonable or rational relationship to the avowed regulatory objective of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5373.291" offset="21596557">The regulatory objective of deportation, the thing that this Court has said takes it out of requiring the criminal -- the constitutional criminal safeguard, the regulatory aspects is that the United States is just getting rid of somebody who is -- of an alien who isn't fit to enjoy the privilege of residing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5392.785" offset="21674506">But actually, nobody makes a determination of fitness, and in this very case, who could make a rational -- can draw a rational conclusion that the petitioner's unfit to live in this country, because if you accept everything that the Government says is true, in 1938, because he wanted to, in his enthusiasm to risk his life as a premature anti-fascist fighter, he cheated on getting a passport and entering and leaving the country.</text>

            <text syncTime="5532.677" offset="22234049">For constitutional purposes, this Court long ago decided that you don't have indict by -- over a very strong dissent that Justice Rutledge for example, is offering.</text>
            <text syncTime="5546.354" offset="22288802">But as Justice Jackson said in the Spector case, who said that these administrative determinations have been sustained as constitutional only by considering them as not inflicting punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.980" offset="22339271">But the more we go on, the more they add causes of deportation, the less these causes have to with do with the ostensible regulatory purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5567.790" offset="22374484">The more these causes become retroactive, he says, the less possible it becomes -- to give any logical content to this doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5577.406" offset="22413040">And all I'm saying now is that if -- maybe it is a civil, and unless you overrule yourself it is civil for the purposes -- for constitutional purposes, you care free now to develop a standard of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="5594.078" offset="22479705">And the standard you should develop and I won't go into the procedures, but the procedures as you know can involve arrest, supervision and so forth, considering these things, it would be reasonable to make it a criminal standard or at the very least, the standard of reasonable substantial and probative evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5613.366" offset="22556818">It is just -- I don't mean reasonable, I mean the standard of the denaturalization case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5621.308" offset="22588583">Now, it is just simply offensive for the Department of Justice to be able to use the same standard of proof to destroy a man's life as it prevails if you're trying to prove in some small court, a $100-court case of a sidewalk slip, or a bill collection claim for $35, there's nothing new with the courts adopting as a matter of judicial policy a higher standard of proof and preponderance in civil cases including in some cases proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5658.194" offset="22736123">Now I've mentioned the naturalization cases, cancellations of land patents, but there's a whole host of other situations in which the English and American Common Law Courts have used these higher standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="5672.904" offset="22794951">Whenever fraud is involved, proof of a lost will, proof of parole trust, reformations of the deed, adultery, illegitimacy of a child born in wedlock, and so forth, all of these have had higher standards of proof than the traditional civil standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5692.950" offset="22875199">Now, this country is a country of aliens and the children and grandchildren of aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="5701.222" offset="22908217">In our deportation laws, because of their harshness, all of which are illustrated here, their harshness, their rationality, we have in a sense betrayed our heritage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5712.593" offset="22953775">The Court has refused to confine Congress as to its power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5717.678" offset="22974046">It's refused to apply substantive due process, a bill of attainder clause, ex post facto, the First Amendment, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5725.709" offset="23006229">But it has not refused to confine the Service, maybe out of remorse or some of the thing it has allowed Congress to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5734.341" offset="23040711">What we are asking here is no more than that you do confine the Service to the point where this man's liberty can -- and that of any other resident alien cannot be destroyed, short of proof which is more than the bare preponderance of the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="5756.646" offset="23129945">Mr Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5760.359" offset="23144782">As I see it, the issue presented by this petition is narrow one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5766.255" offset="23168397">It is not disputed here that the statute prescribes for deportation for entry without inspection under the circumstances depicted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5776.533" offset="23209462">It is not contended that the statute is unconstitutional for any reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="5782.368" offset="23232867">Moreover, the petitioner does not claim that he was not given a fair hearing nor does he assert that there was any deviation from due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="5791.743" offset="23270379">His sole contention relates to the adequacy of evidence on which the deportation charge was reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="5800.204" offset="23304234">Now, petitioner relies heavily on the severity of the consequences of deportation particularly for long time residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="5809.724" offset="23342268">With that premise, all of us will agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="5813.902" offset="23358986">What we do take issue with, however, is the nature of the structure petitioner seeks to place upon that premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="5824.438" offset="23401096">To us, the decisive consideration here is this, the administrative tribunal found unpersuasive evidence convincing to it that there had been an entry without inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="5842.092" offset="23471731">The Court of Appeals in reviewing that decision found that the administrative decision was reasonably supported by probative and substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5853.742" offset="23518333">We believe that petitioner's hypothesis regarding the measure of persuasion is unrelated to the realities of the record before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="5863.596" offset="23557726">Just as a matter of interest Mr. Gordon, how did it happen that suddenly 25 years after the alleged event, the Immigration and Naturalization Service of which you were a Deputy General Counsel have gone after this man?</text>

            <text syncTime="5889.202" offset="23660231">The fact is that the petitioner reentered in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="5894.266" offset="23680397">The following year, World War II intervened and there were deportations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5898.704" offset="23698160">After the end of World War II, there was a period in which the conditions have not been stabilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="5905.351" offset="23724805">Then information came to us that there were a number of people like petitioner how had used fraudulent passports.</text>
            <text syncTime="5913.954" offset="23759182">Investigation was conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5916.144" offset="23767960">The investigation took many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5919.064" offset="23779662">The investigation was followed by efforts to subpoena the petitioner and other witnesses, they resisted, court proceedings followed, and eventually they were required to answer the subpoena's, eventually we've got to the point where they claimed Fifth Amendment privilege and then we proceeded on the other evidence, so the delay isn't as long as it appears, we were trying during that time to make the deportation case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5978.817" offset="24018631">There are cases in which it is our conviction that the consequences of deportation are excessively severe because the family ties, because of the age of the petitioner and because of other considerations urged.</text>
            <text syncTime="5992.805" offset="24074637">In those cases, we do not press for deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5995.875" offset="24086862">There are several thousand such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5998.545" offset="24097520">In our judgment, this was not such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6001.756" offset="24110373">Now, I want to point out moreover Your Honor that Congress has provided has provided avenues for relief in cases of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="6009.388" offset="24140884">There are a number of discretionary remedies which were available to the petitioner and during the hearing he was asked, “Do you wish to apply for any of these discretionary remedies?”</text>

            <text syncTime="6026.103" offset="24207757">And thereafter he thought about and decided not to apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="6030.835" offset="24226670">I do not know why he didn't chose to apply, and that's he didn't want to testify, about his activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6036.114" offset="24247777">But that's speculations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6037.492" offset="24253315">The fact is that there were opportunities for relief, he did not take advantage of it.</text>
