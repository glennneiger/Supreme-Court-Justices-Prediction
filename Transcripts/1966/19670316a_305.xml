            <text syncTime="34.892" offset="242918">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.511" offset="257442">This case comes here on direct appeal from a judgment of a three-judge Federal Court in the District of Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.016" offset="283460">At root what is involved is the validity of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission pursuant to which the issuance of certain securities by REA, Railway Express Agency was authorized, those securities were to be sold to the Greyhound Corporation another of the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.032" offset="355453">The appellants here are five railroads who are stockholders of REA, a number of individual motorbus carriers who are competitors of Greyhound, the Freight Forwarders Institute, the American Trucking Association Incorporated and a number of individual motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.078" offset="431731">At the outset I would like to take just a few moments to sketch the case in sort of an outline fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.538" offset="461511">The basic facts are quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.684" offset="470079">Railway Express is the number one ranking carrier of express freight in the United States and Greyhound is the number two ranking carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.953" offset="507173">Pursuant to the order of the Commission that's here in question Greyhound will acquire a 20% stock interest in REA and that will be accompanied by a 20% representation on REA's Board of Directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.575" offset="565687">There is no question from the record that the intent of the parties here fundamentally is to coordinate and consolidate their express trade activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.075" offset="611662">Now in these circumstances we suggest and the government agrees I think that the record raised a very serious question under Section 7 of the Clayton Act and under Section 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act, which as this Court of course knows prohibits the acquisition of control by one carrier of another without Commission approval pursuant to the Section 5 proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.957" offset="707166">So that the basic question here is what should the Commission have done in a proceeding that it was engaged in when these were questions raised on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.204" offset="748231">And the proceeding that it was engaged in was not a proceeding under Section 7 of the Clayton Act nor under Section 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.089" offset="779682">It was a proceeding under Section 28 (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act, the security --</text>

            <text syncTime="230.590" offset="1025755">Well, Mr. Justice Fortas I am sure you know that one of our issues here is a Chenery issue, a question of the ambiguity of the Commission's order and I must say that I am really quite at a loss in answering the question as to what the Commission felt here because I just can't tell.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.318" offset="1096600">I think that with respect to Section 7, one doesn't know whether the Commission believed that they didn't have to consider Section 7 questions or any question with respect to anticompetitive impact under 28 (2) that was argued to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.787" offset="1170474">Whether they thought that there was no Section 7 question raised on the record that was argued to them, whether they thought that this was really a justice department responsibility or whether they thought that they could do it later, I just -- really at a loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.576" offset="1205687">The only place at which they mention Section 7 is in a sentence of the very opening of the order where – in which they say, I think I quote literally that it is not appropriate at this time to consider the Section 7 question.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.898" offset="1258977">Do you understand I am making, in this question I am making a distinction between Section 7 Section 5 on the one hand and the factor of competitive effect on the other hand as arguably part of the public interest standard.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_dempsey" startTime="307.568" stopTime="367.759">

            <text syncTime="307.568" offset="1333687">Yes I do Mr. Justice Fortas now with respect to the question of the competitive impact the Commission does say on page 200 of the record, it further appearing that intervener's opposition is directed to the possibility of control of applicant by Greyhound and to the anticipated combination and correlation of certain of their facilities and services.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.966" offset="1419264">Now there it seemed to me, when I read the order at the first time that they were raising the question of, the broad question that you raise, of anticompetitive impact apart from a section putting it Section 7 terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.460" offset="1469210">And then in the next paragraph they go into the question of the position that Greyhound will have on the Board of Directors and they indicate their belief that these five Greyhound directors couldn't influence the strong railroad directors and they conclude with what I take to be a finding that there is no control and maybe a finding that there would be no anticompetitive impact or they certainly don't say that.</text>

            <text syncTime="372.820" offset="1594702">All that I can say is that they conclude that paragraph by saying and that control or power to control must be real and not based on conjuncture or remote possibilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="385.828" offset="1646634">Page 201 right on top and that concludes I think the thought that they introduced in the preceding paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.489" offset="1677354">Now I don't -- it does certainly doesn't constitute a finding that they would be no anticompetitive impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.782" offset="1698461">I read that to say that they believe that this 20% transaction alone would not constitute an acquisition of control and therefore they need not pursue the Section 5 now.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.345" offset="1748720">I cannot find in that sentence or in any other sentence in the order a determination of the question that they seem to be raising of anticompetitive impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.735" offset="1794278">So that -- I do think there is a very serious Chenery point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.173" offset="1816116">We've been plagued by that point from the very time this litigation was instituted because at every point the issue seem to shift and at one time we are arguing the scope of 28 (2) at another time we are arguing the question whether there is control or not control, whether there is a Section 7 violation or not, whether Seaboard standard should apply and I -- this case it seems to me is an excellent illustration of the awkwardness of judicial review in the face of a hopelessly ambiguous order.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.315" offset="1960626">Now so far as the – as the facts are concerned I don't know that I need to go into them in great detail because the government does concede that this record does establish a very serious problem with respect to the anticompetitive impact of this transaction, but at sometime or another it will have to be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.330" offset="2032724">And REA concedes that of course only arguendo because they will naturally dispute that in any further proceeding that's been held, but I'd like to touch briefly upon the salient facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.713" offset="2086222">The Greyhound Corporation approached and I might say that these facts are taken almost exclusively from the papers that Greyhound filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.817" offset="2118614">There was no hearing, no witnesses, no cross examination, no Sixth Amendment problem here. [Attempt to Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="511.966" offset="2151215">The Greyhound Corporation approached REA in January of 1965 with an offer to buy a controlling stock interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.345" offset="2184756">That offer foundered, evidently because of the opposition of some of the REA stockholders who were opposed to this program and they have the ability to block it because all existing REA stockholders have the right of first purchase on REA stock sales so that if one REA stockholder wants to sell to a third party another REA stockholder can come in and exercise his right of first purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.107" offset="2291754">The REA management and board then struck upon the notion that in order to get Greyhound into the company the thing to do is to have Greyhound buy 500,000 shares of authorized, but unissued stock as to which the right of first purchase does not apply and there were negotiations and in July of 1964, Greyhound made such an offering a letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.543" offset="2389556">In the letter, Greyhound said that from the start their interest in REA had been to get a position in a company so that the express trade activities of the two concerns could be coordinated.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.240" offset="2440338">They referred to certain studies that had been made by the company in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.268" offset="2456430">They said they didn't' they didn't want to as they put buy into a controversy with the dissident REA stockholders so that they were willing to take this 20% position and leave to the future question as to their ultimate position of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.394" offset="2516929">There were further negotiations and then the matter was put to the REA Board which approved 14 to 3 I believe the vote was with one abstention and then to REA stockholders the proxy statement indicated that the benefits of the transaction would be to secure coordination and consolidation to express activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.458" offset="2605223">A heavy vote was urged because Greyhound had indicated that it wanted to be sure that it would have the cooperation of REA management.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.559" offset="2633644">The heavy vote was obtained, over an 80% vote of REA stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.051" offset="2651617">Now there is no -- there is nothing in the record with respect to these studies that were referred to by Greyhound, with one exception and that's reasonably significant I think, I might mention it.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.669" offset="2698010">There was a two and a half day conference between two vice presidents of these companies about three weeks before Greyhound made its 20% offer and that conference is memorialized in a memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.341" offset="2748688">In the brief it's quite long.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.080" offset="2755688">It's summarized in some detail in our briefs and what it amounted to basically was that the two vice presidents thought that the thing to do here possible was really to have a, an almost total union between two.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.118" offset="2811800">They would use the same terminals, they would use the same service forces, the same maintenance forces, the same supervisor, the same advertising program.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.753" offset="2850356">REA would perform pickup and delivery service for Greyhound.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.612" offset="2865821">They'd have -- entered into through route and joint rate arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.063" offset="2879613">In short an almost complete amalgamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.169" offset="2896018">Now we don't say that this memorandum is a binding contract, of course, we never had said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.986" offset="2915349">All that we say is that it shows with some specificity the kind of program that may very well emerge from this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.612" offset="2953801">The contract itself has several relevant provisions that I might mention that appears on page 15 of the record, it's a letter contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.946" offset="2991208">There is the 20% representation on the Board of Directors clause, sub-paragraph A.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.945" offset="3015137">Sub-paragraph C commits the REA board to consider seriously and work toward a long-term agreement between REA and the Greyhound Corporation to consolidate operating functions and facilities and to cooperate in all lawful, feasible and jointly advantageous ways to effect economy, improve service and increase public receptivity and patronage.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.179" offset="3104057">And then sub paragraph E is the 60-day offer clause and I'll refer to it as the 60-day offer clause by which Greyhound offered to purchase up to an additional million shares of REA stock for a period of 60 days after the closing of the basic 20% transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="806.450" offset="3329128">The notion here seems to be that because of this 60-day offer, because no one can be certain now and the Commission could not be certain when it read this contract and when it was called upon to act, what the ultimate position of Greyhound and the company would be, it was appropriate for the Commission simply to bypass the Section 7 problem or the anticompetitive impact problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="887.630" offset="3653883">As I say if the Commission wants to take that kind of an approach, I don't say that's unreasonable but what I say is that if we are right in our construction of the statute with respect to the obligation of the Commission to deal with Section 7 problems impacts on competition problems at the least and Section 5 problems, then that kind of a position by the Commission is a reason for denying the application, not a reason for granting it and letting this go to the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.382" offset="3772897">What the Commission should have said, if that's the way it felt, to REA we suggest, is now you haven't met your burden of proof here and you have the burden of proof, you haven't met it, you haven't demonstrated that this transaction is compatible with the public interest under Section 20, but it's for a lawful object because this record raises a very serious question under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, a very serious question under Section 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act and you haven't even put us in a position to deal with this problem adequately.</text>

            <text syncTime="1630.020" offset="6623483">There the government said that petitioner, that is the government, asserts that the application places before the Commission serious questions under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, which by virtue of Section 11 thereof the Commission has a duty to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.624" offset="6681893">Greyhound will if the Commission approves this application to acquire a substantial stock interest etc, and they go ahead, and then they conclude therefore the Commission in accordance with its responsibilities under Section 11 cannot avoid determining to what extent, depending the proposed transactional result and effects of Section 7 is intended to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.582" offset="6753677">I think that's a somewhat clear statement than what they have in their brief now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.879" offset="6770918">Maybe they intend to repeat from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.923" offset="6779068">If they don't in any event if they adhere to that then they would be on our side in opposing a postponement on the ground if there was no prospect of ultimate success in the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.879" offset="6834866">In addition I would think that on the Section 5 issue, certainly there is a substantial question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.878" offset="6858898">Now with respect to the temporary restraining order problem Mr. Justice White there is another difference I think and that is that the Commission does operate here within a statutory framework.</text>

            <text syncTime="1906.004" offset="7727417">I think that if the government is right in suggesting that the -- if the Commission had acted the way that we say it should have acted, to have produced absurd results that that's a very good ground for thinking that our doctrinal analysis is wrong one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.575" offset="7785723">On the other hand, if we're right in suggesting that there were no difficult practical problems involved here, that there may very well be damaged, we maybe injured, the public interest maybe injured then I would think that whether you put it under 20a (2) or whether you put it under 5, under 11 and coordinated enforcement of this network of statutes, you really ought to come out the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.204" offset="7876211">But -- well let me say one more thing though in that connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.462" offset="7893243">I think from the point of view of administrative procedure that we would urge that it's more desirable to read the statute so as to include these factors so that one doesn't get into this problem continuously about whether the Commission abused it's discretion in not bringing a Section 7 proceeding immediately or waiting 50 days or waiting an year or whatever it might be, similarly with the Section 5 proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.104" offset="7999822">I think when the Congress says that the Commission must determine that a transaction is in the public interest before it authorizes it, that then the Commission is on notice that it's got to be on some fashion at least with every ingredient of the public interest, everything that touches the public interest in a decently immediate way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.027" offset="8075473">So that I think there is some purpose in reading the statute that way in terms of the operation of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.728" offset="8118314">The question of impact on the appellants I think is important here, it's one of the practical considerations that the government advances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.731" offset="8162304">And as to that, I think one can't say, and this would be relevant to the temporary restraining order situation also, I think one cannot say with any reasonable degree of certitude precisely what the risks are going to be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.569" offset="8225625">There are too many contingency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.048" offset="8231581">The 60-day offer might come out in a variety of different ways, but what one can say it seems to me fairly is that there is a substantial risk of some kind and that root, it arises from the fact that the Commission has approved this basic 20% transaction and that transaction is going to be in effect whatever is done with respect to instituting a Section 5 proceeding or a Section 11 proceeding in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.608" offset="8337847">Now, we have motorbus carriers who alleged before the Commission that their degree of profitability, their measure of profitability basically turned upon express carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.449" offset="8385181">So that we have people who are in a peculiarly vulnerable position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.291" offset="8404511">The proceeding, if there's one, may last for two or three years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2081.107" offset="8427813">So the government suggests though that, well, perhaps the Commission could do something such as Mr. Justice White suggested might be done in a temporary restraining order case in order to protect the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.619" offset="8473893">Perhaps they could impose an interim condition on, if they began a Section 5 proceeding, perhaps they can put the stock in a boarding trust or direct the Greyhound Directors not sit on the REA Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.246" offset="8532407">Well, perhaps they could, but no one knows whether they will and if one must measure the probabilities, one I think must consider that they did not do that in this proceeding where they could.</text>

            <text syncTime="2271.071" offset="9187662">They have simply put the matter on to the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.292" offset="9204590">The -- as to the threshold doctoral question of the scope of 20a (2), the appellees suggest that the legislative history is controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.179" offset="9272090">What that legislative history shows is that when the Congress passed the securities provision the problem that bothered them was certainly the problem of fiscal manipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.927" offset="9323081">But there is not a single item of legislative history that establishes that when the Congress employed the term public interest and lawful object, that they intended that the Commission restrict it's consideration to problems of the fiscal soundness of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.178" offset="9384103">There's not a shred of evidence to that effect and we suggest that when one is confronted with terms in their natural scope would include anticompetitive factors, that one has to have a -- has to measure up to a very strong and a very heavy burden of proof in terms of legislative history to this conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.637" offset="9465919">They also suggest that the -- this Court's decision in the Alleghany case is controlling here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.962" offset="9495176">The Alleghany case of course as the Court knows that is a very complex body of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.935" offset="9519104">We've gone through it in rather laborious detail in our brief I'm afraid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.252" offset="9540420">I would make just one point about it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.837" offset="9550764">We don't think that the appellees read the case correctly, neither did the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.800" offset="9570617">The lower court thought that Alleghany was not controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.842" offset="9582738">What the appellees says that in Alleghany, Alleghany II, the second per curiam decision, this Court held that Section 5 questions were not relevant in the Section 20a (2) proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.899" offset="9618996">As I say, we don't, for reason set forth in our brief, we don't read it in that way, but even if that's right, even if that's what the Court meant in that case, it has very little to do with this case because of the character of the Section 5 issue in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.715" offset="9674271">There the Section 5 question was the allegedly illegal acquisition of the New York Central by Alleghany at some time prior to the Section 20a (2) proceeding and the securities that were in question there had nothing to do with that prior acquisition of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.849" offset="9742817">It was just an exchange of one kind of preferred stock for another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.473" offset="9761311">Now we don't say that in a Section 20a (2) proceeding the Commission must consider every past misdeed of an applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.559" offset="9785657">What we do say is that the Commission, where the securities issues is to be used as a vehicle for acquiring control illegally or may be, and where it is to be used as an instrument for the violation of Section 7 at least perhaps that the Commission must resolve that kind of Section 5 problem and that kind of Section 7 problem in the Section 20a (2) proceeding and we suggest that Alleghany however it may be read doesn't bear on that problem at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2497.082" offset="10091708">There are two transactions involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.116" offset="10107800">First one is the sale by REA to Greyhound of 500,000 shares of stock, which represents 20% of REA stock, and the Commission has authorized REA under Section 20a to issue that stock, it being presently unissued and to sell it to Greyhound, and the Commission has found that REA urgently needs the $10 million that it will receive from Greyhound.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.148" offset="10215946">The second transaction which is also involved here is between Greyhound and REA stockholders and I include the appellant Railroads as among those stockholders most importantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.147" offset="10271953">Immediately after the sale by REA to Greyhound, Greyhound must make a tender offer to REA's shareholders to buy up to an additional 40% of REA's presently outstanding stock and that offer must be completed within 60 days after the offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.464" offset="10369233">One possible result of those two transactions is that Greyhound will ultimately own 60% of REA stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.913" offset="10402983">The more likely result is that the appellant railroads will and they have said very clearly several times that they will, exercise their right of first refusal with respect to the 40% of stock that Greyhound will seek on the tender offer and that they because they already own 10% will then own approximately 50% of REA stock.</text>

            <text syncTime="5386.331" offset="21648697">Now the only response that has been made to that is one that the -- this would give the appellant railroads another chance to block the transactions which it is said they did twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5398.532" offset="21697494">Well, the difficulty with that argument is that the twice involve situations where the right of first purchase was in question, that is to say outstanding stock, 50% acquisition.</text>

            <text syncTime="5492.160" offset="22071986">This is a Section 20a(2) proceeding in which it's the Commission's responsibility to protect the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5498.410" offset="22097063">So that whether or not a private party makes a point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5501.378" offset="22108871">We didn't have much of a chance because they weren't any briefs, there were no arguments just petitions to intervene, which were denied or which were granted and request for hearing which were denied and the petitions for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5511.603" offset="22149831">But in any event, it's the Commission's responsibility do bear a statutory burden you're not the private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5518.481" offset="22177311">Now, so far as what may happen, it seems to me there is a real difference here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5524.391" offset="22200926">There will be, everyone agrees if there is a proceeding two or three year proceeding damage maybe done in the interim and we are not comforted by the fact that the Commission may or may not try to insulate this transaction in the interim period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5538.657" offset="22257977">We don't see any judicial review that we'd have available if they chose not to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5543.813" offset="22278666">And so far as the prospects of a proceeding has been brought or concerned, we are not very comforted there either by the fact in this Court it appears that there seems to be agreement as to what has gone because after all it is up to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5561.319" offset="22348675">Thank you.</text>
