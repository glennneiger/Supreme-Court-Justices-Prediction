            <text syncTime="71.287" offset="427301">The question presented in this case is whether the scope of a search under the automobile exception extends to the personal belongings of a passenger when police have developed probable cause to search a private vehicle generally, but have no probable cause specific to the passenger or her belongings.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.781" offset="513296">Under United States v. Ross, a search of an automobile based on probable cause extends to every part of the vehicle and its contents that may conceal the object of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.379" offset="567735">The officer here had probable cause to search the entire vehicle and its contents because he had reason to believe that the vehicle was transporting contraband and that it could be concealed anywhere inside the vehicle.</text>

            <text syncTime="164.709" offset="801061">However, I feel that Ross still controls the outcome of this case because the rule announced in Ross covers this kind of situation and many, many other kinds of situations.</text>

            <text syncTime="232.542" offset="1072421">First, that item, the purse, is a plausible repository of the contraband that was being searched for here, and it was inside the place where the probable cause attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.021" offset="1122263">In view of that, I think yes, even if the passenger had picked up her purse and taken it outside with her, the officer would have been within his authority to have her put it back in the car or, alternatively, to tell her not to take... pick it up and take it out of the car--</text>

            <text syncTime="268.836" offset="1217557">DiRe teaches us that a search of a person is going to require the individualized probable cause that respondent wants to see attached to the purse.</text>

            <text syncTime="296.225" offset="1327063">But I would argue that a line should be drawn at articles of clothing that are actually being worn by the person getting out of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.533" offset="1368336">If there's a search of an item of clothing, that amounts to a search of the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.094" offset="1386622">However, any other object that might be inside the car when probable cause is established, picked up and taken out of the car, even if it's an item of clothing, ought to be subject to search by the officer because again it's at the place when probable cause is established and it's a plausible repository.</text>

            <text syncTime="350.552" offset="1544402">This Court has given an example of illegal aliens in a van does not give authority to police to search their suitcase or a lawn mower in a briefcase type of affair where it's just physically impossible or for other reasons it's absolutely known that the object of the search won't be there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1168.016" offset="4814305">In United States v. Ross, the Court articulated a clear, logical, and easily applied rule that probable cause to search a car gives the police the authority to search any container in the car that might contain the object of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.313" offset="4867491">The container should not be exempt from that rule simply because it's owned by a passenger whom the police do not have probable cause to arrest.</text>
