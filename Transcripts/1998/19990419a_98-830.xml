            <text syncTime="60.101" offset="389370">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="63.912" offset="404625">The issue in this case is the meaning of the word coal, as used by Congress in reserving the right to mine and remove coal in the 1910 and 1909 Coal Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.169" offset="445690">The court of appeals held that coal also includes methane gas that happens to reside within the coal bed, and that in addition to the right to mine the coal, that the United States and its assignees also have the right to mine and to remove the gas from the coal bed, the rationale here being that you can not only essentially take out all of the coalbed methane, but that you can leave all of the coal behind.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.908" offset="556658">It seems to me that this counterintuitive description of the rights of the United States and its assignees is absolutely wrong, and that the judgment of the court of appeals ought to be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="123.272" offset="642130">The acts involved here, both 1909 and 1910, referred to, I think it was, what, prospecting mining and removing the coal?</text>

            <text syncTime="142.243" offset="717990">Not typically, although to be honest with you, I wish I could make more of that argument, Justice Souter, but if you look at the 1914 act and its description of dealing with gas and oil, phosphate, and the other minerals that it identifies there, it uses essentially the same language.</text>

            <text syncTime="162.697" offset="799805">On the other hand, it is still absolutely clear, I think, to go back to the word coal, which is the pivotal term in this particular statute, that you would hardly find a word that is more commonly understood by the average individual in 1909 and 1910.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.356" offset="858424">It was the source of energy for 75 percent of this Nation's energy, and Congress, according to this Court, at that time acted in a practical way and defined the rights in practical terms that could be understood by average homesteaders.</text>

            <text syncTime="250.636" offset="1151518">First of all, as you well would understand, out in Colorado and in the West, the rights to water are essentially held by the States and the relationship between the States and private parties are fundamentally different than the relationships involved in a litigation like this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.444" offset="1206793">But second of all, the coal... excuse me, the water that is in the coal is chemically bonded, or at least some of it is chemically bonded to the coal, and it is not our position that chemically bonded elements which are in fact constituents of the coal are subject to removal by those who have rights to other minerals that may exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.497" offset="1282966">Our basic point here is that coalbed methane is essentially a physically separate item that just happens to reside within the coal bed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1094.327" offset="4526330">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.511" offset="4543048">As you know, I'm here on behalf of the amici States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.114" offset="4557467">There are five amici States which represent one tenth of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.937" offset="4572723">We're here on behalf of our citizens and ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.768" offset="4588083">We're here as friends of the Court because we believe the decision was inherently wrong, but we're also here in our own interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.865" offset="4628416">We, as amici States, we as States, are owners of lands that are subject to these very same acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.991" offset="4656942">Upon our admission to Statehood for the creation of the States and for the benefits of our public schools we were granted lands specifically for the purpose of funding education, and we were constitutionally in our enabling acts required to dedicate the proceeds from those lands to the purpose of our State educational systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.373" offset="4742519">In 1906, with the presidential withdrawal of the coal lands, we were not allowed to select in lieu lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.189" offset="4777732">Now, in lieu lands... first of all, upon admission to the States, the States were granted specific sections of land within each township, but oftentimes those lands had already been homesteaded or withdrawn, so we were entitled, then, to take in lieu lands instead of those lands, but with the 1906 reservation, that also applied to in lieu lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.872" offset="4860488">So the States were in the position of not being able to select in lieu lands until a 1912 act came along, which is referenced in our brief, that specifically incorporated the provisions of the 1909 and 1910 acts, so that's how the States are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.214" offset="4917853">That's why we are here as property owners as well as on behalf of our citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.836" offset="4936347">In these acts, the States received title to everything but the coal on our subsequent school selections in lieu lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.403" offset="4974591">The amici States here are holders of tens of thousands of acres for the benefit of our public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.766" offset="4996011">Again, they're constitutionally required for school funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.737" offset="5007923">We also have regulatory authority, and given time, I'm going to get to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.019" offset="5025059">We have regulatory agencies that are responsible for oil and gas production, and the regulation of oil and gas production, as well as separate entities that are responsible for mineral production, such as coal production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.569" offset="5071244">So anyway, we're here both as the owner and regulators today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.630" offset="5087544">Now, as the Court recognized in the Andrus case, Andrus v. Utah, and it's cited in all of the briefs, I believe, these lands were granted to the States under a solemn agreement for the support of our public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.111" offset="5141461">It was an inducement for the States to come into the Union, and in inducing the States to come into the Union, they granted the lands for the purpose of our public schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="1334.207" offset="5485859">As was alluded to earlier, the coalbed methane is obtained by normal drilling techniques, not by coal removal techniques that were known to the parties at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.254" offset="5525983">Those removal techniques, as Mr. Justice Scalia I think pointed out, those were, when you took a chunk of coal, and you took a chunk of coal, or several chunks of coal, and you loaded them into a wagon or subsequently a truck, and you hauled them away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.834" offset="5588364">Now, in response to Justice Scalia's question regarding ownership, the gas, the natural gas, the very faint remnants of natural gas that would remain in that coal, under normal mining law practices would belong to the owner of the gas estate, but the mining practices have always followed the rules of reasonable development, reasonable diligence, and in following the rules of reasonable development and reasonable diligence at this point in time, even now in 1999, it's not reasonable to extract the methane gas from those chunks of coal that are removed from a coal mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.053" offset="5761190">But while they're in the ground, and you can use normal gas drilling techniques to produce those, produce the gas, then that is reasonable in some circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.136" offset="5797552">There are still many coal beds throughout the country to which no coalbed methane is ever going to be produced, probably, at least under present technology.</text>

            <text syncTime="1555.852" offset="6372351">Even where it's not their own property, as such, the States have an interest because of severance taxes and other interests that the States have in taxing those products that there be conservation, that the mineral resources, whatever they may be, be conserved, and so therefore the oil and gas commissions don't allow flaring, and don't allow wasting of natural gas products.</text>

            <text syncTime="2619.473" offset="10626862">Second, miners in 1909 necessarily had to remove the CBM as a part of the mined coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.238" offset="10653925">Third, the miners had no way of setting the CBM apart or leaving it behind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.380" offset="10674509">Congress used the term, coal, in light of those realities, to describe what nature had deposited and what miners mined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.608" offset="10707423">This usage is not only the ordinary, practical, common sense usage, but is also consistent with what science tells us about coal, both now and in 1909.</text>

            <text syncTime="3502.287" offset="14158094">But if you look at 545 to 555 of the joint appendix, and you look from the macro to the micro elements of every particle of consideration that the handbook on coal identifies, you will never see CH4, because methane is not a constituent of coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.158" offset="14225595">It is found within the coal, which is why the Government then turns to say, well, it's not the coal, it's the coal deposit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3544.383" offset="14326532">This Court in Western Nuclear specifically held that prior to 1916 the regime was specifically identified minerals.</text>
