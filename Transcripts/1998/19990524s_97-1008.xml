            <text syncTime="7.222" offset="114787">In 1994, Carolyn Cleveland suffered stroke.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.763" offset="136939">She applied for and then she later received social security disability benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.229" offset="158777">Those are available to disabled people who can't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.412" offset="175496">Now, at the same time, her employer discharged her on the ground that she could not any longer adequately perform her job.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.947" offset="209664">She later on brought this lawsuit against her employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.659" offset="224501">It's a suit under the Americans with Disabilities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.033" offset="242056">She claims in the suit that she could perform her job with reasonable accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.454" offset="267760">Now, we granted certiorari in order to consider how to resolve a conflict that might arise when a person tries to assert claims both for social security disability and under the ADA.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.922" offset="329618">The kind of conflict I'm talking about is not purely factual.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.175" offset="346546">As for an example when somebody just says, “Well, the light was red and now it was green.”</text>
            <text syncTime="70.483" offset="367861">Rather the conflict is connected with the statutes, the two statutes, basic legal requirements, an applicant can qualify for SSDI Social Security Disability only if she, “Cannot engage in either her previous work or any other kind of work which exists in the national economy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="91.998" offset="453857">Now, plaintiff can recover under the ADA only if she can perform the essential functions of her job, at least, with reasonable accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.550" offset="492100">Now, some courts have thought as a result of the requirements I just read that trying to obtain or obtaining relief under both statutes would rather be like saying, “No, I can't work for the SSDI statute”, “No, I can work for the ADA.”</text>
            <text syncTime="121.392" offset="571512">And for that reason, those courts have used the doctrine of judicial estoppel or sometimes they've created presumptions, which make recovery under the ADA difficult or impossible for a person who applied for or received SSDI.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.793" offset="641102">Now, the Fifth Circuit in this case, for example, created a rebuttable presumption that would allow a person who has applied for or received SSDI to recover under the ADA only under what it said, were some limited and highly unusual set of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.392" offset="711424">In the opinion that we've written, we -- we disagree with the Fifth Circuit and we hold that courts should not judicially estop an ADA plaintiff or apply a special negative presumption in a case like this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.753" offset="772864">That's because there are just too many instances in which the kind of conflict that I just mentioned is only on the surface, but when you go into it more deeply, you discover it isn't real.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.186" offset="818630">Given the administrative needs of the vast governmental SSDI benefits program, for example, the Government cannot easily and does not look into what's called reasonable accommodation when it decides that an applicant can't work for purposes of SSDI.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.919" offset="889579">But a plaintiff could win an ADA suit by showing that she can work only with reasonable accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.203" offset="918732">Moreover, the Government awards SSDI through applying a matrix.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.245" offset="934928">It's like an administrative matrix that's keyed to systems which in fact means an applicant could qualify for SSDI because the applicant would fall into a certain category, even if that applicant in fact was capable of doing some kinds of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.677" offset="1000652">And then in certain circumstances, the SSA explicitly awards benefits to those who actually are working in something called a trial-work program, and medical conditions, anyway, can change over time.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.912" offset="1049553">Now, for these and related reasons, an SSDI claim and an ADA claim may often exist comfortably side by side.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.740" offset="1084870">Still, we do think that an ADA plaintiff cannot simply ignore the fact that she previously applied for or received SSDI.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.144" offset="1122487">She must explain how the two claims are compatible and in the context of summary judgment that explanation must warrant a reasonable juror's conclusion that assuming the truth of or the plaintiff's good faith belief in the SSDI claim, she could, nonetheless, perform the essential functions of her job with or without reasonable accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.450" offset="1211721">Carolyn Cleveland believes she can easily provide such an explanation in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.479" offset="1235858">We therefore vacate the Circuit Court's judgment and remand the case so that she may have an opportunity to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.244" offset="1262921">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
