            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="85502">The opinion of the Court in No. 97-889, Wright versus Universal Maritime Service Corporation will be announced by Justice Scalia.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="10.407" stopTime="222.660">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="10.407" offset="127089">This case is here on certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.754" offset="148509">Petitioner Ceasar Wright was a longshoreman in Charleston, South Carolina and a member of the International Longshoremen's Association AFL-CIO which has a collective bargaining agreement, the CBA, as we call it, with the South Carolina Stevedores Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.692" offset="224264">The CBA contains a general Arbitration Clause which covers "matters under disputes".</text>
            <text syncTime="42.488" offset="255402">In 1992 Wright was injured at work and sought compensation for permanent disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.129" offset="277972">Under the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act, Wright ultimately settled that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.106" offset="305871">In 1995, he returned to work and was referred to four Stevedoring Companies through the union's hiring hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.080" offset="337740">When the companies learned however that Wright had previously settled the claim for permanent disability they informed the union that they would no longer accept him for employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.553" offset="375670">Instead of filing a grievance pursuant to the CBA Wright filed charges of employment discrimination with the EEOC and the South Carolina State Human Affairs Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.335" offset="422795">He alleged that the Stevedoring Companies refusal to hire him violated the Americans with Disabilities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.528" offset="451530">After receiving a right to sue letter Wright filed the present lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.968" offset="469293">The District Court dismissed the complaint without prejudice because Wright failed to use the CBA arbitration procedure, the Fourth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.751" offset="504506">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today we reverse the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.922" offset="521120">This dispute implicates two lives of our case law, a case called Alexander versus Gardener Denver decided in 1974, held that an employee does not forfeit his right to judicial forum for a Title VII discrimination claim if he first pursues his grievance to arbitration under a CBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.844" offset="604816">A case called Gilmer versus Interstate Johnson Lane Corp decided in 1991 held that a claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act could be subjected to compulsory arbitration pursuant to an Arbitration Agreement agreed to buy an individual in a securities registration form.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.531" offset="687572">Although these cases are relevant to our disposition of the present dispute, we find it unnecessary to resolve the question whether after Gilmer a union may waive an employees' rights to a federal judicial forum for antidiscrimination claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.663" offset="752147">Because we conclude that in this case no such waiver has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.680" offset="768134">The respondents rely upon the presumption of arbitrability we have found in Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.493" offset="795406">We conclude that this presumption does not extend beyond the reach of its principle rationale, which is that labor arbitrators are in a better position than courts to interpret and apply the terms of a CBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.118" offset="841904">This case however ultimately concerns not the interpretation or application of a CBA but rather the meaning of the Americans with Disabilities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.507" offset="887461">We hold that any union negotiated waiver of employee's rights to a federal judicial forum for statutory antidiscrimination claims must be clear and unmistakable.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.945" offset="929257">We do not find such a clear and unmistakable waiver in this CBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.223" offset="946393">For that reason we vacate the judgment of the Fourth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.601" offset="967814">Our opinion is unanimous.</text>
