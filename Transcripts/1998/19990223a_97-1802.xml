            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="148177">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 97-1802, David Conn and Carol Najera v. Paul Gabbert.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.398" offset="189764">Mr. Brazile.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kevin C. Brazile</label>
            <text syncTime="12.349" offset="197496">Mr Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.903" offset="207736">To answer the first question of certiorari raised in this case, there has to be a determination made as to whether or not Petitioners in this case engaged in egregious or outrageous conscience-shocking conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.292" offset="265310">This case, and the case of County of Sacramento v Lewis, as well as the case of Washington v Glucksberg, has set forth the test that should be used in... in making the analysis in a substantive due process case such as this, which involves executive action.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.372" offset="333646">What the Court has told us is that we look to the historical precedent, we look to the case precedent, and we look at the traditions of our Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.841" offset="375442">In this case, the liberty interest at stake is the question of whether or not an attorney has a right not to be subject to a search at the time his client is testifying before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.247" offset="425075">In this case, the Ninth Circuit found that the search warrant was in fact a valid warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.110" offset="448585">Also, at this juncture of the proceeding, this was a grand jury proceeding; there had been no charges filed against Miss Baker, so the sixth amendment right to counsel did not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.620" offset="502606">What tradition normally requires to do a search of a person, whether it be an attorney or anyone else, is in fact a valid search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.626" offset="542626">That's what occurred in this case.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="100.937" offset="551821">Mr. Brazile, if you... you say the conduct wasn't egregious enough to meet what you say is the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.843" offset="587452">But do you concede that it... it was subject to some kind of sanction at all, to deliberately time the search... the search with a warrant... of the lawyer at the very moment when his client was being... was testifying?</text>

            <text syncTime="131.567" offset="674388">In this case, the search warrant was served between the hours that the warrant authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.194" offset="704899">The warrant authorized a search any time between 7:00 a.m. and 10: 00 p.m. in the evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.676" offset="722871">The warrant was executed at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.360" offset="733529">It was a valid warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.869" offset="739589">And when Miss Baker was before the grand jury, each time she made a request to consult with her attorney, the district attorneys and the grand jury foreperson allowed her to leave the grand jury in order to consult with her lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.008" offset="792148">Now, according to this Court's decision in U.S. v. Williams, she had no right to have that lawyer in the grand jury room with her.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.343" offset="825480">And it's not even established that she had a right to consult with him outside of the grand jury under this Court's case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.026" offset="852229">But there are other case law from the Federal circuits that do allow that... that the witness has a right to consult with her lawyer.</text>

            <text syncTime="191.226" offset="913042">If the warrant could have been... it could have been executed before the witness appeared before the grand jury or after, but it wasn't a coincidence that they occurred simultaneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.356" offset="965601">And my question to you, just... is... is whether there is any sanction for this?</text>
            <text syncTime="211.960" offset="996007">Or if it doesn't meet the constitutional standard, that's it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kevin C. Brazile</label>
            <text syncTime="215.923" offset="1011785">Well, there is a sanction for this type of conduct if... under California laws and many others States, there is the tort of abuse of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.548" offset="1042296">If they felt that the warrant was used for the... for an ulterior motive, in an abusive way, they could have brought a tort action for abuse of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.313" offset="1077405">So, there is a State law remedy here.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.063" offset="1132366">--No, Your Honor, we do not concede that the warrant was somehow calculated to interfere or to interrupt with Mr. Gabbert's practice of his profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.790" offset="1171237">What in fact happened is, earlier in the morning, when they were up in the district attorney's office, Mr. Gabbert indicated that the documents that were requested in the subpoena, that he had the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.808" offset="1219406">He indicated that to Mr. Conn.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.671" offset="1226825">And it was at that point he decided to go and to get the warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="298.221" offset="1341033">I mean, I've never heard of a search warrant for... for... is this a normal procedure?</text>

            <text syncTime="1687.776" offset="6899263">Because these were some rather unique circumstances that they were confronted with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.130" offset="6916608">So, I think the remedy, if there is one, is through the State tort law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.794" offset="6939282">And I think, clearly, as I indicated earlier, Justice Ginsburg, the tort of abuse of process is what would remedy a situation like this, where they're alleging that we used the warrant in a deliberate fashion to somehow deprive someone of... of a right or to harm a particular person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.965" offset="7008037">So... but it's not the 14th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.228" offset="7017023">That's not the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.929" offset="7019844">Because we don't want to have the 14th amendment as a vehicle or a mode for setting rules that are going to govern criminal procedure or rules that... or we don't want the 14th amendment to somehow supervise how the grand jury proceedings are run.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.520" offset="7086195">Leave that to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.972" offset="7092046">And if there's a harm that's caused, let the State tort remedy be involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.825" offset="7107406">This is not the kind of egregious, outrageous conduct that's shocking of the conscience.</text>

            <text syncTime="1754.365" offset="7165607">Our contention has been, from the time that we filed the complaint in this matter, throughout the course of the litigation, that the prosecutor's action here was to intentionally time the execution of the search warrant so as to prevent Mr. Gabbert from giving counsel to his client outside the grand jury, and specifically with respect to her potential invocation of the fifth amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.704" offset="7282949">And ultimately, it was the purpose of the prosecutors to get her, the client, to reveal information to the grand jury that she was otherwise reluctant to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="3203.482" offset="12962074">But he was picked by the district attorney, brought to the building, and accompanied the district attorneys and introduced to Mr. Gabbert.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.478" offset="12990077">And when they... when he ultimately did report to anybody, he reported back to the prosecutors what the results of his search were.</text>

            <text syncTime="3225.407" offset="13049741">The California law requires that when the master first approaches the lawyer who is the subject of the warrant, that the lawyer be given the opportunity to essentially turn it into a subpoena and voluntarily turn the documents over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.738" offset="13111077">Which is exactly what Mr. Gabbert did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.180" offset="13124869">He had copies of two of the three pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.272" offset="13137199">And as the Ninth Circuit indicated, his first act was to turn those over to the special master.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.287" offset="13161232">But the... despite the mandate of the California statute, the... the search continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.461" offset="13181921">The mandate of the statute is that if at any point the lawyer invokes the attorney-client privilege with respect to any of the materials, then it's the duty of the master to seal the documents and take them to a court for that court to resolve the disputes with respect to the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.903" offset="13251720">And as we know, Mr.... from the record... Mr. Gabbert invoked the privilege consistently during the 20 minutes to a half an hour that the search took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.429" offset="13293829">And according to Mr. Oppenheim, the master's testimony, because the documents didn't have the words "attorney-client privilege" on them, he didn't view them as privileged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.148" offset="13336670">And so, when he went back to the prosecutors, he told them there was nothing in the files that was privileged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.579" offset="13354433">And that's when the second search took place outside the grand jury room.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.533" offset="13374286">Your Honor, with respect to the... to the question of qualified immunity, the Petitioners in this case ask this Court to set down a rule that there must be some factual correspondence between a previous case of this Court and the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.997" offset="13460073">That suggestion was rejected, explicitly... explicitly rejected... by this Court in 1997, in the Lanier case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.835" offset="13503436">And as this Court said in... in Lanier, that it is... it is not unusual for the... a general proposition appearing in a prior Supreme Court case to be sufficient to give a clear or fair warning of what the constitutional right is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.157" offset="13576788">And as this Court remembers in Lanier, the... the right that was involved was the right of victims not to be subjected to sexual abuse by a State judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.044" offset="13616285">And the authority for the... the previous Supreme Court opinion for... that set out that right was Rochen, which, as the Court knows, was a... a serious physical violation of the person of... of the defendant in that case.</text>
