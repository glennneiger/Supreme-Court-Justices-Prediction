            <text syncTime="62.771" offset="399993">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="64.873" offset="408457">When the North Carolina General Assembly enacted its 1997 congressional districting plan, compliance with this Court's decision in Shaw v. Hunt was its number one goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.401" offset="454537">It met that goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.992" offset="460911">The line-drawing decisions contested here were not driven predominantly by race either for its own sake or as a proxy, but they were made on the basis of actual election data.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.711" offset="503752">They were designed to accomplish the constitutionally legitimate goal of maintaining partisan balance in the State's congressional delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.167" offset="533636">We had a Republican-led House and a Democratic Senate who determined not to gridlock and leave this vital function to Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.824" offset="572297">They came together on a bipartisan, bicameral agreement that retained six districts leaning to each party, a goal that was accomplished by having a Democratic-leaning district created in the midst of the Republican sea that is the Piedmont Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.018" offset="648993">Let me put on the table a half dozen ways this plan differs from those that this Court invalidated in Miller and Shaw and Bush v. Vera.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.484" offset="690893">This plan was not adopted under Federal pressure for maximization of black districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.337" offset="714299">It was not adopted by a process that manipulated district lines to exploit unprecedentedly detailed racial data.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.635" offset="747527">There was no use of computer programs more sophisticated with respect to race than to other Democratic districts' precincts.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.199" offset="777724">Existing political units that are about a hundred times larger than the... than the racially encoded census blocks used in Texas, precincts with the building blocks of the districts in this plan... they were not adopted for the express purpose of creating a majority-minority district.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.800" offset="856196">They did not, in fact, create a majority-minority district.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="180.773" stopTime="194.235">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="180.773" offset="872078">Was there any allegation that the... the precinct numbers were used as a surrogate for race; that is to say, precinct numbers were used in order to include people of a certain race in the district?</text>
            <text syncTime="193.153" offset="921607">Was there any allegation of that here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="walter_e_dellinger_iii" startTime="194.235" stopTime="263.111">
            <label>Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III</label>
            <text syncTime="194.235" offset="925891">I take it, Justice Kennedy, that is the... the heart of the case, that there is this... this overlap, and so given the fact that this... that the precincts included in district 12 are more Democratic and that there is a correlation... it's more African-Americans adhere to the Democratic Party and registration at the present time... that one could have done that as a pretext.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.751" offset="1024007">But I believe and I think that Mr. Everett would concur that there's simply no evidence that that was the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.667" offset="1051592">I mean, I think what you have here is the precise question that the Court answered in Bush v. Vera.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.610" offset="1079386">In the plurality opinion by Justice O'Connor, the Court said that if a State's goal is the otherwise constitutional political gerrymandering, it is free to use precinct general elections, voting patterns, precinct primary voting patterns to achieve that goal regardless of its awareness of its racial implication and that if district lines merely correlate with race, because they're drawn on the basis of political affiliation which correlates with race, there is no racial classification to justify.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="263.111" stopTime="332.719">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="263.111" offset="1201430">Mr. Dellinger, you say that there's no evidence, but I... some of the districts that... that were carved up in order to create this unusually shaped district or some of the... some of the counties were indeed overwhelmingly Democratic, and it would have been easy to put in more Democrats without putting in more black Democrats.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.916" offset="1296620">And... and part of the allegation is that the... what was done shows that there was an intentional effort not only to get in Democrats, but to get in black Democrats.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.903" offset="1336536">And that... and that circumstantial evidence is... is affirmed by the... the affidavits put in by your side which say that one of the purposes of the legislature was to... was to retain the election of incumbents.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.847" offset="1412395">And here you had an incumbent who had been elected by a district that had been unconstitutionally established on a racial basis, and to simply come in and say, well, we want to make sure that he'll get reelected is, it seems to me, more circumstantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.319" offset="1478224">I mean--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="333.400" offset="1482508">--there may not be enough evidence, but it seems to me to go too far to say that there's no evidence that... that there was any racial gerrymander here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="walter_e_dellinger_iii" startTime="341.165" stopTime="518.659">
            <label>Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III</label>
            <text syncTime="341.165" offset="1513646">--Well, to be precise, Justice Kennedy's question was whether there was any evidence that they... that they made a pretextual use of creating a Democratic district, of using Democratic precincts in order to create a district that was more African-American.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.756" offset="1576026">And one could imagine counter-examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.390" offset="1586475">First of all, the State has direct evidence of the... Senator Cooper and Representative McMahan that... that partisan election results were what... were the building blocks for the creation of this district.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.316" offset="1638198">That was their predominant concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.128" offset="1645512">The examples that are given that there are Democratic registration precincts adjacent to but outside district 12, Representative Watt's district, is virtually a non sequitur because there's a very simple answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.059" offset="1709146">The precincts that adjoin district 12 that are not included aren't less Democratic by any measure than the included precincts.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.205" offset="1745822">89 percent of the precincts outside the boundary but adjacent to, that have a majority Democratic registration actually voted Republican on election day in either one or two or all three of the elections that the legislature has been consulting this decade in doing districting.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.578" offset="1823249">You have to understand that North Carolina is basically Democratic in registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.941" offset="1836728">There's not a single one of the 12 congressional districts that has a majority of registered Republicans.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.086" offset="1857313">So their only suggestion is, but the State had some districts outside district 12 that were majority Democratic, to which our answer is, they were not excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.793" offset="1900153">We were already at the equal population limit with this district, and they were less Democratic either in terms of voting registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.318" offset="1930247">There are in the entire 12th district only 2 precincts... they're both in Guilford County; they're noted in red on one of the maps... only 2 precincts that are inside the district that have a Democratic registration that is less than one or more of the neighboring precincts outside the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.265" offset="2026064">And in that case, if the Court... the legislature followed the basic township line, Elm Street, then Lee Street that has traditionally divided Greensboro.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.831" offset="2068278">So that I... I think what the question leads to in terms of the incumbency, I don't think you can have a bill of attainder that... that Congressmen want, the interest in preserving someone of rising seniority may never be a... may never be at interest because of what this Court held about the original plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.043" offset="2141107">The State gains a great deal by having from Charlotte a member of each political party, each of whom is rising in influence within their respective political districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.761" offset="2188023">This is not... the chain of causation from the prior district I think is broken in a number of ways.</text>

            <text syncTime="3238.738" offset="13103863">There's a plan under which Members of Congress have been elected and which is, incidentally, substantially less race-based than this.</text>

            <text syncTime="3255.079" offset="13169273">And there again, the partisan results of maintaining incumbency and so forth were maintained, which is a pretty good indication that there were alternatives available to the State which they didn't use, that instead, as exhibited by their own... the submission under section 5, by portions of the affidavits when strictly... when properly construed, they had a racial motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.736" offset="13263941">They were concerned that because of the removal of the African-Americans in Durham and Gastonia from Congressman Watt's district, there would be a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.714" offset="13303856">And so they tried to assure that this would be racially of a sort that would assure his reelection, which of course occurred under the 1998 plan, but... even a less race-based plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.062" offset="13353176">But there was a specific purpose which is revealed even in the affidavit of... of Senator Cooper--</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.447" offset="13378776">So, they had a purpose and they had a purpose which is reflected in their own documents and it's reflected throughout.</text>

            <text syncTime="3325.581" offset="13451291">They understood quite well that even though there was a recital of a... of maintaining a partisan balance, a recital of racial fairness, that as far as the 12th district was concerned, there was a target, and that was to assure that there would be an African-American reelected and stated in terms of reelecting an incumbent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.695" offset="13535719">But in this particular instance, we would say that it was significant that that incumbent was an African-American.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.332" offset="13566335">Now, it's perfectly fine to have him reelected, but our contention is that it should be done from districts which are not predicated primarily on race, where race is not the predominant motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.240" offset="13613878">And we would suggest, Your Honors, that if you look at these two maps together, you come only to the conclusion that there is such a violation of the ordinary precepts of traditional districting that this has to be viewed as based on race.</text>

            <text syncTime="3492.639" offset="14119504">Race can not only be used not only for its own sake, but as this Court has taught, it shouldn't be used as a proxy or a surrogate for other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.185" offset="14149701">I'm quite clear on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.006" offset="14152940">This is a case where we used the thing itself, and it's really turning Washington against Davis upside down to say that because the thing itself, political affiliation, happens to correlate, that now we have to treat it as if it were suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.615" offset="14211455">It was stated most precisely I think in... in an opinion by Justice O'Connor that you joined in... in Hernandez where two Hispanics were struck from a jury because of their difficulty relying on the translation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.056" offset="14273208">And the Court said that was appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.689" offset="14287732">And... and the strongest statement was in the concurring opinion that said, no matter how closely tied or significantly correlated to race the explanation may be, the strike does not implicate the Equal Protection Clause unless it is based on race.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.157" offset="14341545">That is the distinction between disproportionate effect and intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.311" offset="14358158">That is the heart of our jurisprudence which we turned upside down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.752" offset="14367980">I don't think the State can be forever barred from putting a Democratic district in the Piedmont Crescent that makes as much sense as this one does as if it were some convicted felon or... or bungling constable that had to be held under scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.864" offset="14440392">The '98 plan may look better, but I would just close by saying it's significantly less desirable from legitimate political purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.971" offset="14472888">It includes an entire rural county and takes out Greensboro, which has much more in common with the banking and commercial and urban centers.</text>
