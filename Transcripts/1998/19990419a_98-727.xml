            <text syncTime="9.769" offset="184948">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.922" offset="197591">The district court in this case sanctioned petitioner, who is not a party to the underlying litigation, but instead was the plaintiff's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.167" offset="230610">The question presented to this Court is at what time petitioner should appeal the sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.781" offset="257046">The Sixth Circuit recognized that there were three possible answers to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.923" offset="277630">The first, and this is the rule the that the Sixth Circuit adopted, is that petitioner should wait until the final judgment in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.958" offset="301767">That rule, however, has some serious problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.501" offset="315873">First and foremost, it conflicts with this Court's repeated holding for more than 100 years that only parties may appeal the final judgment.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="54.139" offset="362476">Mr. Chief Justice, there is an indication in this Court's precedents that there are a class of persons known as quasi parties who may appeal, but the quasi party cases do not determine whether or not that appeal should be brought at the end of the case or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.847" offset="413258">This Court's most recent precedents, particularly Marino v. Ortiz and Karcher v. May, instruct that the test is whether or not the individual who seeks to appeal could intervene in the case under Rule 24(b), and there is no question that petitioner could not intervene under Rule 24(b).</text>

            <text syncTime="86.011" offset="489953">Mr. Goldstein, you have recognized that, if the client had been sanctioned as well, the client would have to wait till the end of the line and presumably the lawyer, too, and the lawyer, although not a party, could then appeal, so that seems to be inconsistent with your position.</text>

            <text syncTime="103.722" offset="560797">The circuits that have confronted this question uniformly agree, and so do we, that when that sanction merges into the final judgment, practicalities require that the sanction itself come up together, because it would be injudicious--</text>

            <text syncTime="118.680" offset="620670">But we have a nonparty, the attorney, who could take an appeal then, so the Chief asked if that rule is without exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.107" offset="658391">One exception would be this very situation if the client were sanctioned along with the lawyer.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.628" offset="712412">That sanction merges into the final judgment because it is... it operates upon the client.</text>

            <text syncTime="159.708" offset="784719">There are very serious practical consequences that make this sanction effectively unreviewable at the end of the case under the third prong of the Cohen doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.833" offset="941245">I mean, I don't see why, conceptually, that makes any sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="233.835" offset="1081261">Mr. Chief Justice, this Court has been quite clear that the final judgment itself has to be looked at in isolation, and you determine whether or not the appellant is a party to the final judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="245.673" offset="1128595">The final judgment is simply what we refer to to determine when she may appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.298" offset="1147090">She's still appealing the order, whether she appeals it immediately or later.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="253.550" offset="1160151">That is correct, the difference being that under Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure she is precluded from appealing the sanction order more than 30 days after it's entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.147" offset="1206544">She is directed... the rule directs that you appeal upon the entry of the order or the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.041" offset="1230055">Rule 4 further instructs that the entry is to be determined under the entry definition in the Rules of Civil Procedure, and that is when it is placed upon the docket by the clerk of the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.947" offset="1273731">The sanction order here was entered upon the docket.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.569" offset="1284180">It was the only thing that she could appeal from as a practical matter under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.613" offset="1308422">She had no other choice.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="292.105" offset="1314378">Mr. Goldstein, there are all kinds of orders that are made in the course of a trial proceeding, orders that are not immediately reviewable, and you don't lose out because of the 30-day limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.152" offset="1358577">I think that that applies to a final order, not to an interlocutory order.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="308.264" offset="1378953">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.706" offset="1384700">This Court has instructed that mere discovery rulings, or anything else, really, that goes to a party to the litigation, one of the actual litigants, all of those merge into the final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.865" offset="1433392">But the Court has been equally clear that when it is a third party, when it is not a litigant who is in question, and we point the Court particularly to Alexander and its progeny, which are discussed at length in the blue brief, and those cases instruct that when you are dealing with a third party who has been punished by the district court, that order does not merge into the final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.729" offset="1516879">The only time that it may be appealed is directly upon its imposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.120" offset="1534433">The Court has drawn a very clear line between the actual litigants before the district court and third parties who might be punished by--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="354.285" offset="1563064">Well, if the Court should decide that no such line was ever drawn and that it would make no sense to draw it, that is, the judgment is the occasion, as Justice Scalia said, it answers the when question.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.223" offset="1614786">You can appeal it then.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.904" offset="1625549">The attorney isn't seeking to reverse the judgment against the client, but is seeking to review an order that was made along the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.764" offset="1676957">So you were beginning to tell us that even if it's right that this would be appealable at the end of the line, still, you said, it could be appealed earlier because--</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="395.062" offset="1726172">--Exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.943" offset="1729725">If I could return to your earlier question, the sanction is effectively unreviewable, notwithstanding a holding by this Court that petitioner technically could file a notice of appeal from the final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.020" offset="1774029">There are two classes of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.570" offset="1780193">The first is, it is not at all clear that there will be a final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.774" offset="1797016">The district court, for whatever reason, might never close the case, the case could settle, the case could simply languish, and the attorney would never have a triggering right, under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure ever to bring such an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.162" offset="1854590">In addition, along with those practical considerations, the attorney really is injured in the interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.597" offset="1880295">We do not believe that this is an independent ground for appeal, but when you look at all the practical considerations for an attorney, the attorney is forced to pay the money--</text>
