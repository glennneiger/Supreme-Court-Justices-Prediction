            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="85811">The opinion of the Court in No. 97-2048, O'Sullivan against Boerckel will be announced by Justice O'Connor.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="6.860" offset="113187">This case comes on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.990" offset="133667">The respondent Darren Boerckel was convicted in an Illinois Trial Court of rape, burglary, and aggravated burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.556" offset="167940">He appealed his convictions to the Illinois Appellate Court which affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.460" offset="187584">He then filed a petition for leave to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.378" offset="211303">That Court denied the petition, didn't take the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.667" offset="228440">Later, Boerckel filed a federal habeas petition seeking relief from his convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.208" offset="250591">The District Court found that Boerckel had procedurally defaulted three of his claims by failing to include them in his previous petition for leave to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.881" offset="301269">The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, concluding that Boerckel had not procedurally defaulted those claims because he was not required to present them in a petition for discretionary review to the Illinois Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.881" offset="361246">In an opinion filed with the Clerk of the Court today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.507" offset="387787">Federal habeas law requires State prisoners to exhaust their state remedies before they bring their claims in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.019" offset="421850">Thus, it gives the State courts an opportunity to act on their federal claims before the filing of a federal habeas petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.125" offset="466258">The question presented here is a recurring one in habeas law.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.435" offset="483499">What state remedies does a prisoner have to invoke to satisfy that exhaustion requirement?</text>
            <text syncTime="106.768" offset="512861">In this case we are asked to decide whether a prisoner has to seek relief in the Illinois Supreme Court when that Court has only discretionary control over its docket.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.387" offset="571271">The Court has the opportunity to say, we will take the case or not, just as this Court exercises discretion over its docket.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.822" offset="609096">So, Illinois has which is rather typical a two-tiered appellate review system and most criminal appeals are heard by the Intermediate Appellate Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.365" offset="651205">Any additional appeal from that court are presented to the Illinois Supreme Court in a petition for leave to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.118" offset="682239">The Illinois Supreme Court has discretion whether to take the case or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.741" offset="704704">The exhaustion rule is codified in Section 2254(c) of the federal habeas statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.412" offset="735424">It provides that a habeas petitioner shall not be deemed to have exhausted State court remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.058" offset="757994">If he has the right under State law to raise by any available procedure, the question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.854" offset="789132">This language does not require prisoners to invoke clearly fruitless or duplicated procedures in State Courts, but we hold today that it does require state prisoners to give State Courts the opportunity to correct any constitutional errors by invoking one complete realm in the State's established review procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.940" offset="873560">In this case, that includes asking the Illinois Supreme Court for leave to appeal on all the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.532" offset="899891">Although Boerckel had no right to review of his claims by the Illinois Supreme Court he did have a right to raise his claims in that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.948" offset="941582">Although, our holding today has the potential to increase the number of claims filed in State Supreme Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.216" offset="974601">We note that nothing in the decision requires the exhaustion of a specific state remedy when state law provides that the remedy is unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.316" offset="1015039">We hold only that the creation of a discretionary review system does not without more, make review unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.809" offset="1048998">Justice Souter has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.749" offset="1060805">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion which Justices Ginsburg and Breyer have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.217" offset="1086614">Justice Breyer has filed a separate dissenting opinion which Justices Stevens and Ginsburg have joined.</text>
