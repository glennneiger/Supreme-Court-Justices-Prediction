            <text syncTime="67.105" offset="413857">Our case addresses both the issue of disability and the issue of qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.068" offset="433710">A functional analysis is required by a plain reading of the statute and under this Court's decision in Bragdon.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.333" offset="462758">Defining the impairment, simply naming the condition, here monocularity, does not end that analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.279" offset="494627">A functional analysis establishes whether the impairment substantially limits the major life activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.144" offset="522004">The Ninth Circuit held that Mr. Kirkingburg is disabled because he sees differently from other people, not because he sees substantially... in a substantially restricted or a substantially limited manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.651" offset="576129">Mr. Kirkingburg sees with one eye almost everything that an average person in the general population sees with two eyes.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.159" offset="618134">He lacks peripheral vision and he lacks some cues for depth perception.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.733" offset="640391">Here Mr. Kirkingburg claims that his own mind has compensated and helped him in terms of depth perception, by giving him an enhanced ability to use monocular cues.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.979" offset="689396">Viewing Mr. Kirkingburg's seeing functionally then, he's not substantially limited in the major life activity of seeing.</text>

            <text syncTime="307.941" offset="1377253">And the... and the fact in this case is that this employer had a qualification standard, which the statute allows it to have, that was based in safety and it was applied to everyone, but you had to have 20/40 vision in each eye independently in order to drive a truck for the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.795" offset="1452694">That standard is the same standard that the Department of Transportation, the DOT, has in its regulations for truck drivers.</text>

            <text syncTime="431.852" offset="1872848">It simply gave people with diminished visual abilities an opportunity to help the Government prove whether they were safe or not.</text>

I mean, suppose you started off with a... well, many people who lose an eye midway through life, for instance, will go through a transition period where they have very poor depth perception, very poor vision in the very beginning because they're adjusting, and then they'll get better and better as time goes by.</text>

            <text syncTime="3504.892" offset="14165027">I just have two brief points I'd like to address responding to points made by Mr. Hunt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.616" offset="14187911">First, he was talking about the waiver program as a proxy for safety, and I would like to call the Court's attention to some things in the Federal Register.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.112" offset="14221974">At 59 Federal Register 59388, the Federal Highway Administration recognized that its study was flawed and has admitted that some of the waiver drivers were sub par performers who individually may represent an unacceptable risk to safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.401" offset="14287071">That Federal Register entry was in November of 1994 after Mr. Kirkingburg got his waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.996" offset="14313507">Their own panel of doctors that advises the Federal Highway Administration and other studies and advisors over the years, as recently as October of last fall, have advised the Federal Highway Administration not to change the 20/40 each eye acuity standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.876" offset="14372962">In fact, that standard or a like standard has been in place since 1935, starting with good vision is important to safe driving.</text>

            <text syncTime="3575.168" offset="14446105">In the same breath, the Federal Highway Administration declared the current people in 1996 to be sufficiently safe to grandfather them, and... and I can't reconcile that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3606.757" offset="14572538">The other thing I'd like to address very quickly is the fact that I do not believe that the comment, he is legally blind or blind in one eye, is susceptible to construing the term legally blind separate from the phrase or blind in one eye.</text>
