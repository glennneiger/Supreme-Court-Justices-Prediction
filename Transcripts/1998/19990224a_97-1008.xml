            <text syncTime="15.733" offset="207469">Carolyn Cleveland, a stroke victim with a known perceptive and expressive aphasia, a known language disruption, didn't even get a chance to present her Americans with Disabilities Act case, even though, or even because, she had applied for Social Security disability benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.746" offset="287508">In a case very similar to Mrs. Cleveland's case, in the McKenna case, Christine McKenna, who had committed various infractions in the workplace, got to present her case, and Carolyn Cleveland has not.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.396" offset="346127">In fact, Ms. McKenna received more favorable treatment than Mrs. Cleveland in the fact that Mrs. McKenna did not have to overcome a presumption.</text>

            <text syncTime="92.935" offset="516236">It would be like a judgment in some other hypotheticals we might suppose.</text>

            <text syncTime="102.851" offset="555942">The distinction is in our particular case this evidence, these representations, these general statements that were made by Mrs. Cleveland to the Social Security Administration, were discovered after the violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and somehow are used to presumptively penalize Mrs. Cleveland from being able to bring action.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="144.837" offset="723857">And if somebody such as your client has said, I am totally disabled, that might be pretty strong evidence, I suppose, even if you don't give it presumptive effect?</text>
            <text syncTime="157.606" offset="774953">That's what she said: I am totally disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.361" offset="793970">I suppose that that is some evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.281" offset="801598">Presumably, that could change over time.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.033" offset="812674">But speaking as of the time she made the statement, that would be an important piece of evidence, I suppose?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. John E. Wall, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="173.946" offset="840259">It would be in the sense that at various points in time she did have to say, in response to various questions of the Social Security Administration, words of that caliber or character.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.113" offset="881010">Now, in our particular situation here there was a period of time, as the Court is well aware, that Mrs. Cleveland returned to work and was physically capable of doing the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.847" offset="911939">And had she been accommodated by her employer, there would have been no necessity to resurrect her Social Security disability claim.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="198.382" offset="938062">Well, why shouldn't it be even more than just strong evidence?</text>
            <text syncTime="202.245" offset="953526">If she has sworn to a government agency that she is 100 percent disabled, why doesn't that shift the burden to her to show that, even though there are differences between what ADA, why doesn't it shift the burden to her to show that those differences are relevant in this case, that is to say that her statement did not take into account accommodation or her statement was made at a later date or whatever?</text>
            <text syncTime="241.321" offset="1109843">Why doesn't it shift the burden to you it seems to me?</text>

            <label>Mr. John E. Wall, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="242.701" offset="1115276">Well, I would think that that would upset the normal summary judgment process here, being that this is an affirmative defense raised by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.758" offset="1147564">It is their burden to establish the essential elements of their defense.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="253.670" offset="1159162">Well, but the doctrine of judicial estoppel does upset the normal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.803" offset="1179746">I mean, when you have on the record testimony under oath in another, in another government proceeding, we upset the normal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.329" offset="1225826">And here she's there under oath saying that she's 100 percent disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.222" offset="1245366">Why isn't it reasonable to put the burden on her to explain to the tryer of fact why that doesn't mean that she's 100 percent disabled for purposes of the ADA?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_e_wall_jr" startTime="291.394" stopTime="295.799">
            <label>Mr. John E. Wall, Jr.</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="295.799" offset="1327704">But the question is is it just an admission against interest that can come in along with all the other evidence in the case or is it something more, something that should actually shift the burden of proof?</text>

            <label>Mr. John E. Wall, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="311.847" offset="1391861">The reason being is because people who apply for Social Security disability may be victims of Down's Syndrome, may be victims of dyslexia, may be victims of brain damage, may be victims of strokes, may have expressive and perceptive aphasia, as Mrs. Cleveland does, may have any number of other psychomotor abnormalities which may interfere with their normal language perception.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="337.524" offset="1494574">Well, they have enough normal language perception to fill out the application, I take it?</text>

            <label>Mr. John E. Wall, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="343.106" offset="1516935">Well, the process as I understand it, Mr. Chief Justice, is that this initial application that was completed by Mrs. Cleveland here was compiled after a telephone interview, and she signs it.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.496" offset="1562493">And sure enough, she would have the liberty, I suppose, in the normative world to give further explanation as to what she may have said.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="362.330" stopTime="392.199">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="362.330" offset="1593839">With respect to that, Mr. Wall, the facts are a little confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.244" offset="1609513">I thought that when she initially had her stroke nobody knew whether she would recover, because she wasn't... at the time she had her stroke, she had no memory, she could hardly talk.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.450" offset="1654339">At what point did she file that application?</text>
            <text syncTime="381.992" offset="1672520">This is the kind of disability one may recover from and one may not.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.605" offset="1686940">So had she... had she made a startling recovery by the time she filed that application?</text>

            <text syncTime="393.990" offset="1720481">As a matter of fact, the application for Social Security disability benefits I believe was filed on or around January the 21st of 1994, which was some 14 days after the onset of the stroke.</text>

            <text syncTime="1737.184" offset="7093242">Under the normal rules of summary judgment, the applicant in fact is going to have to come up with some kind of an explanation for the statements that the applicant made.</text>

            <text syncTime="3002.926" offset="12156190">One reason that has been suggested in the briefs, although that's not what we're here to resolve, but I mean one reason that's been suggested in the briefs is that in her Social Security application she was using form language.</text>
