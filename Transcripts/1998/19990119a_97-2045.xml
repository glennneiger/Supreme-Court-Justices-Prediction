            <label>Mr. Mark L. Evans</label>
            <text syncTime="29.935" offset="247763">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="32.351" offset="257480">After this Court granted certiorari in this case, respondents adopted a surprising strategy.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.541" offset="282244">In their brief on the merits, they refused to address the two issues on which the Court granted review and instead offered up lengthy arguments on issues that the Court had not agreed to review and, in fact, arguments that respondents had not made or mentioned in their brief in opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.170" offset="352775">And then in yet another surprise about 2 weeks ago, respondents later withdrew one of those three arguments in their... in their merits brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.775" offset="395198">Barring another surprise today, therefore, what we are left with are two arguments, neither of which can succeed unless the Court is prepared to overrule a very large number of its Eleventh Amendment and Commerce Clause precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.952" offset="447861">To bring the case rather briefly back to where it started, the Court granted certiorari to consider two questions: one involving Alabama's use of res judicata as a bar against a constitutional challenge to an Alabama State tax brought by taxpayers who were complete strangers to the prior judgment that was asserted as a bar, and the second involving the lawfulness of Alabama's franchise tax under this Court's Commerce Clause precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.019" offset="560187">Now, although respondents put up a defense on both of these issues in their brief in opposition, they obviously chose not to do so again in their merits brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.327" offset="601356">And I think I can understand why.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.843" offset="607417">It's because both issues are controlled by this Court's recent and frequently unanimous precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.897" offset="631658">The due process in our case is a near... in our... in our judgment is a near clone of Richards against Jefferson County, which was decided less than 3 years ago by a unanimous Court in another case that came from Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.872" offset="679515">And the Commerce Clause question is controlled by Fulton against Faulkner and in another recent Commerce Clause decisions of this Court that have condemned facially discriminatory taxes and that have narrowed the complementary tax doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.464" offset="733954">I don't think I will belabor these points because they are not contested at this point, but as we explained in our brief, the Alabama franchise tax is unlawfully discriminatory because it taxes Alabama corporations based on the par value of their capital stock, a figure that they are utterly free to set and adjust as they wish without any effect on their business operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.962" offset="819949">But it taxes out-of-State corporations based on the capital actually employed in the State, in other words, based on their business operations in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.936" offset="863835">In our view there's no... no need to look any further because any tax that allows in-State corporations to, in effect, determine their own tax liability and not out-of-State corporations is facially discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.779" offset="923185">In their merits brief in this Court, respondents obviously have abandoned their defense on both of these issues, and they've raised three new issues, one involving the jurisdiction of the Alabama State courts, one challenging this Court's appellate authority under the Eleventh Amendment, and one attacking the entire body of this Court's negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.443" offset="1001866">The first of these issues need not concern the Court any longer because 2 weeks ago Mr. Cooper wrote a letter to the clerk withdrawing his jurisdiction argument and acknowledging that it was in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.298" offset="1045229">And in our view--</text>

            <text syncTime="232.583" offset="1058395">--ask to... I... I take it, from what you've said so far, that... that Justice See on the Alabama Supreme Court who spoke before on the nine... that his position is essentially right.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.860" offset="1115551">Is that--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_l_evans" startTime="247.326" stopTime="413.134">
            <label>Mr. Mark L. Evans</label>
            <text syncTime="247.326" offset="1117327">Yes, exactly right.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.326" offset="1121402">Justice See actually... just... just one minor correction... spoke for three with another who did not join the opinion but... but also dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.980" offset="1152018">In our view, the Court need not reach any of the other issues that... either of the other issues that respondents raise here because they've waived those arguments by not presenting them in their brief in opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.422" offset="1209800">But if the Court does reach the issues, we believe the Court should reject both of these arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.476" offset="1233938">Both ask the Court to overrule rafts of its own precedents without any serious justification in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.867" offset="1271554">The Eleventh Amendment theory is that in actions brought against the State in State court with the State's consent, this Court has no constitutional power at the end of the... the end of the process to review a resulting State court judgment raising Federal questions and... and deciding them in the favor of... in favor of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.246" offset="1345010">But that issue was unanimously resolved against respondents' position just 9 years ago in McKesson, and respondents have provided no good reason to revisit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.886" offset="1391613">And in their negative Commerce Clause argument, the respondents ask the Court to nullify a principle the Court has embraced for at least a century and a half and that has engendered enormous reliance throughout the Nation's economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.444" offset="1441872">And moreover, they ask the Court to do this in the least controversial aspect of the negative Commerce Clause, one that invalidates State laws that... that facially discriminate against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.038" offset="1496207">As we explain in our reply brief, there is simply no reason to do either of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.708" offset="1522852">Neither of the doctrines that we're talking about were announced and splintered or badly reasoned opinions that reflected departure from established precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.713" offset="1558901">Neither has proved unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.165" offset="1568723">Some members of the Court have questioned what they view as excesses in the application of the negative Commerce Clause, but even those members have regularly expressed a willingness to continue to apply the core principle of anti-discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.259" offset="1629118">And finally, it's not insignificant that Congress has power to alter the effects of both of these jurisprudential principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.317" offset="1673317">Under the negative Commerce Clause, they can exercise authority to permit the States to do what respondents here would like to be able to do, and even under Article III, Congress could restrict this Court's appellate authority if it felt it was appropriate to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.242" offset="1737056">And the Court's precedents have repeatedly made clear that stare decisis has extra force where Congress can itself make changes in the Court's decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="426.442" offset="1833813">But I think it would raise an interesting question, and it may well be able to do that under... under its Commerce Clause authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.095" offset="1852413">It would be an interesting question I think constitutionally whether that is appropriate or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="440.034" offset="1888253">This... one of the things that I've noticed recently, in this term even, is that the Court has repeatedly refused to consider arguments raised by respondents as alternative grounds for affirmance that have not been preserved, sometimes invoking rule 15.2, sometimes not.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.948" offset="1971844">And the most recent was in El Al Airlines just last week where the Court declined to consider an argument that was not presented in the brief in opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.971" offset="2007998">Earlier this term, there was a case called Knowles.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.755" offset="2015103">So, from the point of view of petitioners, the Court should not address either of these new arguments that have been made by respondents, but should simply decide the questions on which it granted certiorari, reject the arguments that respondents made in their brief in opposition on those grounds, reverse the judgment, and remand it for provision of appropriate relief consistent with the Court's precedents.</text>

I think it would be a very strange, with all due respect, interpretation of the word suit to suggest that the framers and the ratifiers of the Eleventh Amendment didn't contemplate at all a suit coming to the courts through the appellate route as opposed to initially instituted in the Federal court route.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark L. Evans</label>
            <text syncTime="2458.658" offset="9962702">Just three very quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.293" offset="9977226">Mr. Cooper has referred to Seminole's... the opinion in Seminole as suggesting that there are other routes to raise Federal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.882" offset="10015573">The footnote I believe he is referring to is footnote 14, and the three items that are mentioned are a suit by the United States, an Ex parte Young action, and then I'd like to just quote this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.540" offset="10058205">And this Court is empowered to review a question of Federal law arising from a State court decision where a State has consented to suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.546" offset="10090284">That is this case, just to underscore Justice Kennedy's point that the assumption underlying Seminole may well have included this Court's appellate authority over a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.568" offset="10126333">Second, Mr. Cooper mentioned the Ford Motor case as an example of one that held that a... a waiver of State sovereign immunity does not necessarily translate into a waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.809" offset="10179309">True, but only with respect to actions in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.529" offset="10194146">That very case, which is typically cited for this proposition, says the following at page 470 at 323 U.S.--</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.719" offset="10230927">As we indicated in the Reed case, the construction given the Indiana statute leaves open the road to review in this Court on constitutional grounds after the issues have been passed on by State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.277" offset="10277216">So, the very decision in which the Court held that a... a State sovereign immunity waiver does not convert to an Eleventh Amendment waiver also assumes that there's review available in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.334" offset="10325386">And finally, a lot of this we believe is entirely hypothetical because the... for purposes of Alabama law... this is a case cited at page 6 of our reply brief... in a case called State against Norman Tobacco, which was basically the reason the jurisdictional argument that Mr. Cooper had made as his first argument did not work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.062" offset="10404275">The Alabama Supreme Court said that a... an action of the sort we have here... and I'm quoting again... is not a suit against the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.735" offset="10438966">Now, that doesn't necessarily bind this Court in its interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment, but that bears some relevance to the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.906" offset="10463730">Unless the Court has further questions.</text>
