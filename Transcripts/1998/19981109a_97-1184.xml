            <text syncTime="55.599" offset="369595">However, subsequent to the reversal by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia the Authority reevaluated the issue and changed its mind, and decided that the statute did, in fact, obligate the agency to bargain.</text>

            <text syncTime="82.747" offset="478160">We cite in brief cases where we've done this when we disagreed, so the Authority could have, given the multiple venue provisions of our statute, have chosen not to have followed the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia's decision in this case, but did, in fact, reconsider its original position and decide that the D.C.

            <text syncTime="140.474" offset="709083">The Authority said originally in the case on remand from the District of Columbia that it had reconsidered the issue and thought the District of Columbia Court of Appeals was correct and, despite several reversals by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Authority has stuck to its position.</text>

            <text syncTime="242.274" offset="1116279">We don't think deference is required in this case because we think the statute is clear that there is an obligation to bargain midterm.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.187" offset="1143969">If you think it unclear, yes, we would seek deference in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.070" offset="1159434">The Congress, of course, passed the Federal Service Labor Management Relations Statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="269.853" offset="1226621">Mr. Smith, how could it be the will of the Executive, since the Executive is always an adversary in all the proceedings that are before the FLRA, so Congress set you up to be an arbiter between the unions and the Federal Executive.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.293" offset="1344381">But the question is, do you come here with some assumption of validity of what you have done in the narrow situation where what is at issue is the internal management of the personnel of the executive branch, and the President has chosen to disagree with you to such a degree that he's willing to go to court about it?</text>
            <text syncTime="318.116" offset="1419613">I mean, initially, very often two agencies of the Government disagree, and that is usually resolved internally, but here we have two agencies disagreeing, and they've come to the Court and asked us to settle it and the question... it's a very narrow question I'm asking.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.306" offset="1480426">In settling this particular question, do you really think we... it fits our scheme of Government to give deference to these three individuals, never elected by anyone, appointed without removal power by the President, over the views of the President, and I have serious doubts whether it's proper to give deference in that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="378.277" offset="1660253">I mean, maybe Congress does want that scheme of things and does not want the President to be in control of the personnel of the executive branch, but I... that's just not the way I read the Constitution.</text>
