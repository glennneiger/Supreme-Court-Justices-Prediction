            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="84291">The opinion of the Court in No. 97-1056, Marquez against the Screen Actors Guild will be announced by Justice O'Connor.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="9.792" offset="123370">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.835" offset="147612">The petitioner is a part-time actress who successfully auditioned for a small part in a television series.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.433" offset="173943">It was being produced by respondent, Lakeside Productions.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.192" offset="188990">After she was hired, but before she began to work, she was told that she would have to comply with the terms of a collective bargaining agreement between Lakeside and the union that represented all employees on its productions.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.784" offset="243324">And that was the respondent's screen actor's guild, the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.814" offset="259520">Under the collective bargaining agreement, all employees were required to become members of the union within 30 days of their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.694" offset="290972">This clause track the language of the section of the National Labor Relations Act that authorize this type of union security clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.115" offset="324722">But contract did not go on and explained that this Court has given that statutory language a specialized meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.376" offset="357741">Specifically, the contract did not explain that this Court has interpreted the statutory language to allow an employee to satisfy the membership condition merely by paying the portion of the union's fees attributable to its role as the exclusive bargaining agent for the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.598" offset="434645">The agreement did, however, spell out that it interpreted the 30-day grace period to begin running with any work an employee had done in the entertainment industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.110" offset="480725">And because the petitioner had previously worked in the industry for more than 30 days, she had to comply with the terms of that clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.095" offset="516670">When she had not paid her union fees by the day of the filming, Lakeside hired a different actress to play the part.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.875" offset="547703">The petitioner filed suit against the union claiming that the union's agreement was deficient in two ways, the collective bargain agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.518" offset="582289">She alleged the union security clause breached the union's duty to treat her fairly because it did not tell her that membership that's written in the clause had acquired a specialized meaning in the labor law.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.831" offset="639550">Second, she alleged that the union's grace period provision, a 30-day provision, was inconsistent with the terms of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.008" offset="676226">Now, the District Court granted summary judgment to the union, holding that the union did not breach its duty of fair representation by failing to spell out in the agreement all the interpretation associated with the proper enforcement of a union security clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.953" offset="744040">Second, the District Court held that petitioner's challenge to the grace period provision was really just to claim that the union's clause violated the statute, a kind of claim that fell within the primary jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board, not the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.945" offset="812062">On appeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.186" offset="828990">And in an opinion filed with the clerk of the Court today, we affirm the judgment of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.597" offset="862635">First, we held that a union does not breach its duty of fair representation merely by negotiating a union security clause that tracks the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.810" offset="903491">A union breaches its duty of fair representation when its conduct toward a member of the bargaining unit is arbitrary, discriminatory or in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.329" offset="941525">Petitioner does not allege the union's conduct was discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.662" offset="958871">And on the record before us, we could not conclude that the union's conduct was arbitrary or in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.915" offset="983948">We do not decide in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.989" offset="992203">Petitioners claims that the union illegally enforced the union security clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.572" offset="1014564">And that it breached its duty of fair representation by failing adequately notify of her rights under the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.161" offset="1040895">Second we hold the petitioner's challenge to the 30-day grace period provision falls within the primary jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.624" offset="1078720">Her claim at basis is a claim that the union's clause is inconsistent with the statute and this type of claim is one that belongs in the first instance before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.952" offset="1124069">Justice Kennedy has filed a concurring opinion which Justice Thomas has joined.</text>
