            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="85910">The opinions of the court in two cases will be announced by Justice Breyer.</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="5.915" offset="109525">The first case is Kumho Tire Co. v. Patrick Carmichael.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.498" offset="131886">It follows from the case we decided six years ago called Daubert v. Merrell Dow, and in that case the Court held that District Courts should not admit expert scientific testimony unless the District Judge thought it was reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.951" offset="197714">The Court there also said when the judge carries out that gatekeeping function, it may ask certain specific questions concerning theories, testability, peer review, error rate, and acceptance within a relevant scientific community.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.086" offset="266155">Those questions could help determine whether scientific testimony is reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.529" offset="287993">In this case we again consider the admissibility of expert testimony, only this time the case involves not scientific testimony, but expert engineering testimonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.850" offset="337208">The case arises out of an automobile accident that took place in 1993.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.249" offset="358837">The plaintiffs were driving in a minivan, the van’s right rear tire blew out and the plaintiffs thought it was a defective tire and they brought a tort suit against the manufacturer and its distributor.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.710" offset="416725">To help prove the case the plaintiffs wanted to introduce the testimony of a tire failure expert, and he was going to testify that the tire was defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.874" offset="457371">He reached that conclusion based upon his own visual and tactile examination of the tire, and also upon a theory that if the tire was not defective he could tell by the presence of certain rather specific physical marks.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.779" offset="512960">The District Court excluded that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.170" offset="526543">The judge asked the questions that I mentioned before, the specific questions from Daubert and he said he thought the answers to those questions showed the expert’s testimony was not reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.374" offset="567399">But the Court of Appeals reversed, because the question was asked not of a scientific expert but of a different kind of expert, and in the Court of Appeals’ view the Daubert questions and Daubert didn’t apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.445" offset="623614">We disagree with the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.222" offset="634795">We hold first, that the basic gatekeeping obligation that Daubert discussed which is tied back to the Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 702, obligation to assure that testimony is not only relevant but reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.029" offset="689966">We hold that that obligation, that gatekeeping function, applies not just to scientific testimony but to all expert testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.619" offset="724343">Second, in carrying out that Rule we say that the Court may consider the four more specific questions that Daubert mentions about testability, acceptance, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.456" offset="775647">The Eleventh Circuit had held that a trial judge may ask questions of this sort only where an expert relies on the application of scientific principles, but not where the expert relies on skill or experience based observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.869" offset="837296">But we disagree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.769" offset="844924">We think sometimes these questions or factors could be relevant to that kind of testimony, and in our view the Rule of Evidence doesn’t match certain kinds of questions to certain kinds of experts.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.722" offset="892780">Life and the legal cases that it generates is simply too complex to warrant a definitive match.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.740" offset="920783">At the same time we emphasize in respect to those specific questions the word ‘may’, that is to say the judge ‘may’ use those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.276" offset="954952">Their use will not always be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.172" offset="966550">The trial judge must have considerable leeway in determining how to go about determining whether the particular expert testimony is reliable, and the judge should consider the specific factors where there are reasonable measures of reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.000" offset="1021825">Third, the trial judge must have the same kind of legal attitude in deciding how to test an expert’s reliability, what kind of procedures to have, as the trial judge enjoys when he decides or he/she decides whether that expert’s relevant testimony is reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.652" offset="1092460">On review for that decision an abusive discretion standard will apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.334" offset="1115239">Then finally, our opinion to show an example of the principles I just discussed, it reviews in detail the specific decision at issue here, namely the decision about this tire failure expert.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.677" offset="1168529">I think I will spare you with details in this oral statement of tire failure analysis, so the briefs run into that matter rather thoroughly, and thus we learned quite a lot about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.442" offset="1215654">It is a very interesting subject, and lot of rich detail there.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.839" offset="1237179">After examining the record we conclude that the Trial Court’s decision to apply the specific Daubert factor here and to exclude the testimony, those decisions were reasonable ones and therefore lawful ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.182" offset="1290573">Because we agree with the District Court’s conclusion and because the Court of Appeals did not agree with that conclusion, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.284" offset="1327040">Justice Scalia has filed a concurring opinion in which Justices O’Connor and Thomas join; Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
