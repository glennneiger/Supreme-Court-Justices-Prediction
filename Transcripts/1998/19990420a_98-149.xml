            <text syncTime="64.843" offset="402797">The act was a valid exercise of Congress' power because section 43(a) protects business property rights from unfair competition, including false advertising.</text>

            <label>Mr. David C. Todd</label>
            <text syncTime="141.575" offset="709683">In our view the property right was codified by the Congress in the Lanham Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.847" offset="730790">The tort of unfair competition and trademarks has always been... have always been wrongs that have been tied together.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.582" offset="769765">They have long been recognized at the common law, in the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.005" offset="783453">The 1947 Lanham Act tied all these pieces together and created a clear statement of a Federal remedy for unfair competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="172.183" offset="832145">Well, supposing Congress had never passed the Lanham Act but just felt that organizations such as yours were put at a considerable disadvantage by the sovereign immunity doctrine of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.223" offset="892331">Could Congress have stepped in and said these are property rights created by State law but we don't think the States adequately protect even when they have sovereign immunity?</text>

            <label>Mr. David C. Todd</label>
            <text syncTime="196.780" offset="930470">That is our position, yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that the fact is that Congress can step in, having determined that the State remedies are genuinely inadequate and that there is a need to foster interstate commerce, the commerce of this country, for there to be a Federal standard governing these matters.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="221.197" offset="1028168">But you're in trouble, I think, if you say it's based on interstate commerce, because we've held that Congress can't abrogate sovereign immunity under it's commerce power.</text>

            <text syncTime="232.473" offset="1073308">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm certainly aware of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.945" offset="1087205">The passage of the Lanham Act is clearly based upon the Interstate Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.182" offset="1116149">It is a Commerce Clause exercise of congressional power.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.993" offset="1127329">I think it's notable there's never been any question but that this is a valid exercise of Congress' power.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.907" offset="1158989">However, the abrogation of the State's immunity, which did not take place until 1992, is an exercise of Congress' section 5 Fourteenth Amendment power.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.085" offset="1207786">Florida Prepaid argues that there is no ability on the part of Congress to protect property rights to the extent that they have been created or, I guess in this case, even codified by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.849" offset="1282810">This is a view of the scope of section... of the Fourteenth Amendment and section 5 powers which finds no support in the text of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="324.063" offset="1439649">They certainly decided that there was a need for a standard here, and that given what they found to be an inadequate protection of these rights by the State, they determined that in the exercise of the section 5 power there should be an abrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.849" offset="1530764">This Court has found that it is for Congress, at least in the first instance, to determine whether and what legislation is needed in order to secure the rights protected by section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.540" offset="1597533">It is our position that Congress did act pursuant to a valid grant of power under section 5.</text>

            <text syncTime="387.966" offset="1695231">No, but this Court has never narrowed a property right in anything approaching a right to alienate or sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.920" offset="1727100">The fact of the matter is, this Court has found--</text>

            <text syncTime="401.594" offset="1749775">I mean, it's so far removed from anything we would think of as a property right.</text>

            <text syncTime="977.062" offset="4051685">Now, waiver and abrogation are sometimes confused and, before this Court's decision in Seminole Tribe, it's understandable why they were, but they're very different concepts, as we think this Court recognized in Seminole Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.422" offset="4109050">Abrogation is the unilateral act of power by the national legislature, acting within its constitutional scope.</text>

            <text syncTime="1083.952" offset="4479257">Now, in the specific context of the Eleventh Amendment, where this Court has always recognized the viability and applicability of the concept of waiver and consent, this Court, subsequent to Parden, in Missouri Employees qualified Parden in the way in which I just articulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.654" offset="4558042">That is, it's not just, if you run a railroad, or if you choose to run a railroad, it's that the Parden doctrine, that is, voluntariness will be imputed and applied to the State if what the State... if the activity is not something that States traditionally have done but instead is something that private parties have done and for profit.</text>
