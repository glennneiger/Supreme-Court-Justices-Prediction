            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="8.169" offset="118014">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.084" offset="141733">In 1992 the petitioner Jones was indicted under the federal carjacking statute 18 U.S. Code 2119.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.232" offset="178304">At that time the statute, which includes three numbered subsections, provided in the first subsection that whoever possessing a firearm takes a motor vehicle from the person or presence of another by force and violence or by intimidation, shall be imprisoned not more than 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.084" offset="253746">In the second and third subsections, the statute increased the possible penalties to 25 years in prison if a victim suffered seriously bodily injury and life imprisoned, if a victim die.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.065" offset="301602">Petitioner’s indictment made no mention of the subsections providing hiding penalties and that his arrangement the magistrate judge informed petitioner that he faced the maximum sentence of 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.235" offset="346324">Upon conviction however, the District Court imposed the 25 years sentence under the statute second subsection, based on its finding by preponderance that one of the victims had suffered serious bodily injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.812" offset="396584">The petitioner challenged that finding contending that serious bodily injury was an element of the offence defined in part by the second subsection of 2119, the subsection referring to facts, which had been neither pleaded in the indictment nor proven to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.572" offset="459695">The District Court rejected the argument finding that the second subsection defined a sentencing factor, not an element of the offence and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.466" offset="503268">In an opinion filed today with the Clerk the Court we reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit and hold that the federal carjacking statute sets out three separate offences by the specification of distinct element, each of which must be charged by indictment, proved beyond a reasonable doubt and submitted to a jury for its verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.405" offset="579023">The structure and wording of the statute admittedly offer mixed clues about Congress’ intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.633" offset="603891">But the fact that the carjacking statute was modeled on several other federal robbery statutes and that those statutes treat serious bodily injury or similar facts about violence as offence elements convinced us that Congress intended serious bodily injury to be an offence element in the carjacking statute as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.175" offset="686020">Our interpretation is also informed by the principle that when a statute is susceptible more than one plausible interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.892" offset="716949">We should avoid the reading that would raise serious doubt about the statutes constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.160" offset="742027">The government’s treatment of the statutes numbered subsections as sentencing considerations would do just that because as a line of our case is beginning with In re Winship more than a quarter centaury ago may clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.456" offset="791137">It is doubtful whether under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the notice injury trial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment, a fact, other than prior convictions that raises the maximum penalty for an offence maybe exempted from the requirements of indictment submission to a Jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.655" offset="875983">Justice Stevens and Justice Scalia have each filed concurring opinions; Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and the Justices O’Connor and Breyer join.</text>
