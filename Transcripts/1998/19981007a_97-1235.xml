            <text syncTime="41.058" offset="310654">Second, courts, not juries, are the appropriate decisionmakers for all inverse condemnation liability issues and, finally, the concept of rough proportionality does not apply to this case, where the city denied the proposed development.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.587" offset="372826">What ties these issues together are the concepts of deference and the concepts of the limited role of the Constitution and the Federal courts in the local land use planning process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1212.934" offset="4998171">On page 16 and page 20 of the appendix to the petition the Court relies upon the rough proportionality standard as the basis for finding that the jury could have found that there was no sufficient evidence to support the city council's verdict, and it may be sufficient for this Court simply to vacate the judgment and eliminate that discussion from the Ninth Circuit's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.180" offset="5087197">But we do want to make clear our position on that question, that this Court's decisions in Nollan and Dolan imposed that special rule for a special situation, where the concern was that the city might actually be extorting a right of physical access, essentially an interest in property on the land, and using the occasion of a permit approval in order to extort that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3411.640" offset="13792973">The Fifth Amendment is a critically important part of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.329" offset="13835814">It was applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.548" offset="13848666">It was enforced in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.066" offset="13854726">As this Court said very recently in the Dolan case the Fifth Amendment is not to be considered as some sort of poor relation in the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.589" offset="13888790">It is just as important as the First Amendment or the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.374" offset="13903941">The reason that it's important is that people like this developer need to know that when they are dealing with their regulating local government agencies that their rights are protected, that they can't be simply strung along and abused at the city's whim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.419" offset="13972173">I think, looking at the record in this case as the court of appeals laid it out, what you have here is a pattern of abuse, if you will, and I think the jury was entitled to look at that pattern that existed from 1981 when the first application for use of this land was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.047" offset="14042599">The judiciary in general and this Court in particular remains the only hope of these kind of people.</text>
