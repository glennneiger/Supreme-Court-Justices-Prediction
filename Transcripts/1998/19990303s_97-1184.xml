            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="85581">The opinion of the Court in No. 97-1184, National Federation of Federal Employees versus Department of the Interior and a companion case will announced by Justice Breyer.</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="14.736" offset="144513">The labor relations between federal agency and federal employee union are governed and administered by a special statute called the Federal Service Labor Management Relations Statute and a special agency that is called the Federal Labor Relations Authority, it is a little bit like the private sectors National Labor Relations Act in the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.058" offset="249734">Now, this case focuses upon a statutory requirement in that statute that I just mentioned, which says that federal agencies and unions "they must meet and negotiate in good faith for the purposes of arriving at a collective bargaining agreement".</text>
            <text syncTime="59.749" offset="324549">Now everybody agree, that this language requires the agency and the union to negotiate over basic collective bargaining contracts, ordinary contacts, for example, begin at a certain time that go on for few years and then end.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.465" offset="395393">But does it also require the agency to bargain with the union midterm that is during say that, three years so period that the regular contract is in effect?</text>
            <text syncTime="89.902" offset="445130">They might want to do that to negotiate about matters that the regular contract did not cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.277" offset="470626">Also, does that language require the agency to bargain at the end of the normal contract's term about whether or not there will be midterm bargaining?</text>
            <text syncTime="107.004" offset="513571">Several years ago the District of Columbia Circuit held that the statute did require midterm bargaining but later the Fourth Circuit held the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.227" offset="558397">It said that not even the authority that agency they couldn't even require a midterm bargaining, because the statute simply could not be read to require or to permit the authority to require midterm bargaining or bargaining about midterm bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.461" offset="631331">This case comes to us out of the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.743" offset="644497">We review its interpretation of the law and we disagree with that interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.512" offset="671560">We hold that the statute can be read to impose a requirement to bargain midterm or to bargain about bargaining midterm.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.863" offset="712938">But it does not have to be read that way; rather it is up to the authority to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.104" offset="745957">The statute's language is ambiguous, it simply talks about "collective bargaining" without mentioning midterm or endterm bargaining and we could find no literal language or history or basic purpose or other interpretive tool that, in our view, conclusively resolve the ambiguity one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.689" offset="840311">That being so, we conclude that Congress intended the relevant administrative agency, namely the Federal Labor Relations Authority; the Congress intended that agency to decide whether, when, how, or what sort of midterm bargaining should take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.072" offset="921813">That authority, not a court, is the appropriate party, to weigh and to consider the various policy oriented arguments that the parties have advanced in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.622" offset="971968">Consequently, we send this case back to the authority, so that it may exercise its power to decide about midterm bargaining without the constraint imposed by previous lower court opinion holding that the statute itself conclusively resolve the question either one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.162" offset="1054201">Justice O'Connor has filed a dissenting opinion which the Chief Justice has joined, in which Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas have joined in part.</text>
