            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="85904">Today's order of the Court has been duly entered and certified and filed with the Clerk, may will not be otherwise announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.051" offset="118087">The opinion of the Court in No. 97-1909, Murphy Brothers versus Michetti Pipestringing will be announced by Justice Ginsburg.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="17.098" offset="154240">This case concerned a time limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.146" offset="166466">The time allowed a defendant named in a State Court lawsuit to remove the action to a Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.810" offset="201052">The governing measure is 28 U.S.C. ยง1446(b), which provides that the removal notice shall be filed within 30 days after the receipt by the defendant through service or otherwise of a copy of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.205" offset="274717">The question presented, must the named defendant be officially summoned to court before the time to remove begins or does the removal clock starts even before service of process when the named defendant receives a faxed copy of the filed complaint?</text>
            <text syncTime="67.044" offset="354025">Respondent Michetti Pipe filed a complaint against petitioner Murphy brothers in an Alabama State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.184" offset="382551">Three days later Michetti faxed a courtesy copy of the filed stamped complaint to one of Murphy's Vice President, nearly two weeks after that Michetti officially served Murphy.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.184" offset="438557">30-days after service but 44-days after receiving the faxed copy of the complaint, Murphy removed the case to a Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.521" offset="475964">The District Court denied Michetti's motion to remand the case to the State Court, but the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed and held the case should go back to the Alabama Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.794" offset="525075">Defendant's time to remove, the Eleventh Circuit held, ran from Murphy brothers' receipt of the faxed copy of the filed complaint not on the later day of official service.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.792" offset="573035">We reverse the Court of Appeals' decision and hold that a named defendant's time to remove is triggered by simultaneous service of the summons and complaint or receipt of the complaint after service of the summons, but not by mere receipt of the complaint unattended by any formal service.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.307" offset="651089">We read the removal prescription in light of a bedrock principle: An individual or entity named as a defendant is not obliged to engage in litigation, unless notified of the action and brought under a court's authority, by a formal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.323" offset="719112">The summons continue to function today as it did historically as the courts command directing an individual or entity to participate in a civil action or forgo procedural or substantive rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.428" offset="775537">When Congress enacted 1446(b), the legislators did not endeavor to break away from that traditional understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.857" offset="813257">The original version of 1446(b) provided that the petition for removal maybe filed within 20 days after commencement of the action or service of process, whichever is later.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.440" offset="863622">Congress soon recognized that this provision created problems in states like New York, where service of the summons commences the action and that service could precede the filing of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.064" offset="914090">Under 1446(b), as originally enacted, the removal time in New York could have expired before the defendant obtained access to the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.683" offset="956617">To prevent this from happening Congress, in 1949, enacted the current version of 1446(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="224.822" offset="985143">Nothing in the legislative history of the current version suggest that Congress, in making changes to accommodate atypical state commencement and complaint filing procedures, meant to dispense with the historic function of service of process as the official trigger for responsive action by a named defender.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.651" offset="1072497">The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion, which Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas have joined.</text>
