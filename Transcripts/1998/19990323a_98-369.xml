            <text syncTime="282.025" offset="1273573">--Two reasons, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.026" offset="1281514">First, that interpretation rests not so much on an interpretation of what representative of the agency means, but an application of that to the Inspector General Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.865" offset="1332923">The theory... and I have given two theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.385" offset="1338983">One is that the control by the agency representative constitutes who a representative of the agency is.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.331" offset="1366778">The FLRA is wrong about that because they have misconstrued the Inspector General Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.393" offset="1382974">They are not entitled to deference because that is not a statute within their expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.206" offset="1402304">The second theory is that the IG provides a benefit to agency management.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.860" offset="1432920">The FLRA is not entitled to deference under that theory for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.394" offset="1450997">First, their interpretation that any entity that provides a benefit to agency management is... is seriously overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.460" offset="1487254">That construction departs from the purposes behind the labor statute and it would also encroach on an Inspector General's independence.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.946" offset="1521214">It would reach not only an agency's Inspector General, but it would also apply to Federal and State law enforcement officers who investigate criminal wrongdoing by agency employees and submit an investigative report to the head of the agency who then uses that report for disciplinary purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="365.090" offset="1605850">You say the FLRA does not have the expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.642" offset="1615986">Is... is that the criterion for whether we give deference?</text>
            <text syncTime="370.974" offset="1629361">thought it was rather whether the agency was acting within its scope of administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.189" offset="1654229">If it's a field that the agency has been given authority over, whether or not it's very expert, even if in this aspect of it it may not know any more than courts, if it has been given authority over that area, we generally defer.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.956" offset="1709295">And hasn't the FLRA been given authority over this area to... to stop this or to permit it?</text>

            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="396.459" offset="1731238">Justice Scalia, the answer is no, and the reason is that there is nothing in the Inspector General Act that gives the FLRA authority to construe the provisions of that statute just as this Court in the ATF case held that the FLRA was not entitled to deference in... in construing the travel allowance statute, which is a statute that was outside its area of presumed expertise.</text>

            <text syncTime="437.460" offset="1895287">Well, there are two bases on which it has done that, and... and let me try again.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.213" offset="1914304">What a representative is depends upon the application of various other laws, and the basis of their decision is... is based on two theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.407" offset="1951085">One is that a... to be a representative, one has to be under the control of agency management.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.134" offset="1982014">To answer that question, you have to look to the Inspector General Act, which is the statute that the FLRA has no particular expertise in construing, and they simply misconstrued that statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="471.022" offset="2029557">I thought they said, well, we're dealing with a statute that codifies the Weingarten rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.185" offset="2050141">So, the focus of our inquiry is, first and foremost, the person who's supposed to benefit from that rule, the employee who was there alone confronted by the employer with an allegation of serious misconduct, frightened and needful of help.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.270" offset="2138539">That's what the Weingarten rule was meant to take care of, and that's what the FLRA has in its charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.602" offset="2163826">And then it says, for this purpose and this purpose only, does the Inspector General represent the agency vis-a-vis that employer?</text>
            <text syncTime="518.113" offset="2217952">And it was only in that very limited sense with the first view of FLRA its bailiwick, which is we've got this statute that codifies the Weingarten rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="536.996" offset="2293393">First, the Weingarten decision itself was based on equalizing the balance of power between labor and management.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.410" offset="2331114">It... it... as has been construed in subsequent decisions, it does not include those employees who are not unionized.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.386" offset="2366954">It does not include outside law enforcement agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.389" offset="2378970">It only includes management interviewing a unionized employee for the... so that the rights that were collectively bargained would not be undermined by management by using the investigatory process.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.818" offset="2432678">That concern is not present here because the Inspector General is precluded from participating in the collective bargaining process and is not part of that process.</text>

            <text syncTime="596.814" offset="2532675">That doesn't sound like we're concerned about equalizing bargaining power across the table over an agreement, but the concern is 262 to 263 of Weingarten where the Court speaks of the fearful, inarticulate employee who may not be able to relate accurately the incident that's being investigated or being too ignorant to raise extenuating circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2848.288" offset="11538650">That the OIG investigator was acting here as representative of the agency is manifested in a multitude of activities that actually occurred and is also consistent with the roles and duties and responsibilities under the IG Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.959" offset="11605315">Here we had an IG investigator at the outset invoke the disciplinary authority of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.924" offset="11641155">This is not a right inherent to the IG, but one that is routinely unleashed... this disciplinary hammer... upon employees to compel their attendance and to assure that they cooperate fully and answer all questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.666" offset="11712103">This was not an isolated situation in this NASA case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.100" offset="11729867">To review the Second Circuit case and the D.C. Circuit case, agents that were specifically appointed and selected by the OIG, who are not OIG agents since they have the authority to gain further assistance from others within the office, those agents also advise the employees that they must appear or they will face dismissal.</text>

            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="3432.099" offset="13873893">Justice Kennedy, I'd like to return to your question about who the IG reports to because Executive Order 12993, which is not cited in the briefs, provides that the President shall engage a process to investigate wrongdoing by an Inspector General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.293" offset="13950588">So, in those instances when the Inspector General and the agency head are at loggerheads, pursuant to this delegated authority, the deputy of the Office of Management and Budget convenes a committee called the President's Committee of Integrity and Efficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.372" offset="14006908">The PCIE investigates outside the realm of the agency whether or not the Inspector General has committed any wrongdoing, and pursuant to that process, the agency head is basically taken out of the disciplinary process through the investigation of whether or not the IG has committed wrongdoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.035" offset="14081619">So, in answer to your earlier question, the IG really reports not only to Congress through those mechanisms created in the Inspector General Act, but also to the President who has the authority to appoint and to remove and to create this mechanism for the discipline of the Inspector General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.325" offset="14150791">That creates a further insulation and independence of the Inspector General in performing its function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.181" offset="14178167">I would also like to point out that the remedy that the FLRA asserts in this case runs against the agency and the agency, therefore, has to be able to have the authority to direct the Inspector General to comply in a certain way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.910" offset="14237099">And that's exactly contrary to the... to the prerequisites of the Inspector General Act which provide for investigative independence on the part of the Inspector General in conducting investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.678" offset="14284120">Allowing a union representative in these contexts allows the union representative to serve as an advance beacon of all of those types of questions that an Inspector General might ask not only of the worker who is being investigated, but also of the coworkers, and in the D.C. Circuit case, in which the D.C. Circuit held that a union... that an IG was not a representative, the court there specifically noted the problem where the worker had confided to the union representative having committed a number of crimes and the D.C. Circuit there held that the IG was not the representative.</text>
