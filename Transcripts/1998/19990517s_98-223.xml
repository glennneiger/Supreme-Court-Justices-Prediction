            <text syncTime="0.000">The second case I have to announce is Florida versus White, No. 98-223.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.809">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.848">After the police arrested respondent on charges unrelated to this case, they seized his car because they believe that it was forfeitable under Florida's Contraband Forfeiture Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.849">They did not secure warrant authorizing the seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.254">During a subsequent inventory search the police discovered cocaine in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.809">As a result, respondent was charged with drug possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.549">Respondent moved to suppress the cocaine on the grounds that the warrantless seizure of the car violated the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.573">Although the Trial and Appellate Courts rejected this argument, the Supreme Court held that, absent exigent circumstances, a warrantless seizure of an automobile under the Forfeiture Act violated the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.425">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.721">Over 70 years ago in Carroll verus United States we held that the Fourth Amendment does not require police to obtain a warrant before searching a car for and seizing contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.418">Our holding was rooted in federal law enforcement practice at the time that the Fourth Amendment was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.752">Specifically, we noted that early Congresses authorized federal officers to conduct warrantless searches of ships and to seize concealed goods subject to duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.436">The principles underlying the rule in Carroll and the founding-era statutes upon which they were based support our conclusion that the warrantless seizure of respondent's car did not violate the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.226">Although the police lacked probable cause to believe that respondent's car contained contraband, they certainly had probable cause to believe that the vehicle itself was contraband under Florida law.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.341">Recognition of the need to seize readily movable contraband before it is spirited away, undoubtedly underlies the early federal laws relied upon in Carroll.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.448">This need is equally weighty when the automobile, as opposed to its contents, is the contraband that the police seek to secure.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.214">In addition, our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence has consistently given police greater latitude in exercising their duties in public places.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.565">Indeed, the facts of this case are nearly indistinguishable from those in G. M. Leasing Corp. versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.379">In that 1977 case we held that federal agents did not violate the Fourth Amendment by failing to secure a warrant prior to seizing automobiles in partial satisfaction of income tax assessments.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.785">Therefore, based on the relevant history and our prior precedent, we conclude that the Fourth Amendment did not require a warrant to seize respondent's automobile in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.425">Justice Souter has filed a concurring opinion which Justice Breyer has joined; Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Ginsburg has joined.</text>
