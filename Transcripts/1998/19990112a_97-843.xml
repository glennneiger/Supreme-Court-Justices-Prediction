            <text syncTime="16.672" offset="210678">At issue in this case is whether title IX's broad prohibition against sex discrimination requires schools to remedy and address student to student sexual harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.799" offset="255191">The Eleventh Circuit has decided that title IX imposes no obligations on schools to remedy this type of discrimination, no matter how severe or pervasive the harassment, no matter how cognizant school officials are... are of it, no matter how capable officials were of remedying the harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.350" offset="325408">Under this blanket rule, schools simply cannot be held accountable under title IX either in court or in the administrative enforcement context for... for refusing to address this discrimination.</text>
