            <text syncTime="14.810" offset="206627">We are here today because the circuit court unduly restricted the district court's evaluation of the reliability of certain expert testimony offered by respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.947" offset="255215">The Eleventh Circuit barred the district court from considering the reliability factors set forth in this Court's decision in Daubert v. Merrell Dow.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.135" offset="295966">If permitted to stand, the Eleventh Circuit's decision would allow experts to escape scrutiny under the reliability factors merely by invoking experience in some broad sense as a basis for testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="53.465" offset="361272">At some point during your argument... I just am troubled by this, and wish you would address it.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.590" offset="385827">It sounded to me as if your expert, the defense expert, used just about the same methodology as the plaintiff's expert.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.887" offset="423026">He talked about over-deflected operation because of severe beading, groove compressions, the discoloration on the side, and I don't know if it's waiver, or estoppel, or stipulation, but it seems to me that this is what your expert was talking about, too, and I'm troubled by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.029" offset="491571">Just during the course of your argument, if you could mention that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph H. Babington</label>
            <text syncTime="88.761" offset="502438">Justice Kennedy, we disagree with that interpretation of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.071" offset="515708">First, the... it it is clear that the petitioners' expert physically examined the tire before he issued his report.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.238" offset="552384">The respondents' expert, by contrast, issued his report containing his conclusion before conducting any physical examination of the tire.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.543" offset="581641">In addition, there was a completely different methodology that was used, and that's what troubled, most troubled the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.218" offset="612257">The methodology used by the respondents' expert was a process of elimination, rule of thumb methodology that we pointed out in our briefs, and by contrast, our expert used a methodology that asked very broadly, what are the causes, why did this tire come out of service, and in asking that looked at all of the evidence and did not limit his consideration of the evidence just to eliminating certain factors of abuse.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="141.676" stopTime="166.640">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="141.676" offset="714134">The principal attack in the briefs, as I understood it, on the plaintiff's expert was that he had these four factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.130" offset="751959">Now, I recognize that he said, if there are four and any two are present, then I'll make one conclusion, and you may argue about that, but so far as the factors that he uses, i.e., the discoloration, the beading, et cetera, they were the same, were they not, as your own expert?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_h_babington" startTime="166.640" stopTime="214.462">
            <label>Mr. Joseph H. Babington</label>
            <text syncTime="166.640" offset="814026">They looked for the same evidence on the tire in some respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.803" offset="834611">The respondents' expert, of course, limited his consideration, did not look for particularly affirmative evidence of defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.648" offset="861987">But the major difference was the way that they... the method that they applied to get from what they saw on the tire to their ultimate conclusion in the case, and our point is that a district court, in evaluating the reliability of expert testimony offered by parties before a court should not be prohibited from considering the logical, common sense questions that flow out of this Court's Daubert factors, broadly understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.788" offset="974627">The lower courts have applied and understood the Daubert factors in a flexible, broad manner, as this Court intended.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="214.462" offset="1005243">Well now, let me ask you something.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.844" offset="1018826">The Eleventh Circuit apparently reviewed the decision of the trial court to apply the Daubert standard de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.672" offset="1066160">The Eleventh Circuit looked at that de novo, said it was a question of law and it would look at it de novo, but I think acknowledged that the ultimate decision of the district court whether to exclude the evidence should be reviewed on an abuse of discretion standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.242" offset="1132407">Now, I'm a little confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.415" offset="1145050">What is the standard we should apply to this question that you present us with here?</text>
            <text syncTime="256.329" offset="1172740">Do we look at it de novo, or do we look at it under an abuse of discretion standard?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_h_babington" startTime="262.434" stopTime="279.065">
            <label>Mr. Joseph H. Babington</label>
            <text syncTime="262.434" offset="1197190">The standard of review of the Eleventh Circuit's holdings that were the basis for its decision should be reviewed de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.179" offset="1228119">The Eleventh Circuit made two errors of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.499" offset="1237419">First, it crafted this experience exception that I was discussing, which is that if an expert invokes experience--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="279.065" stopTime="289.412">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="279.065" offset="1263646">Well, let me back up, then.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.706" offset="1266258">What standard of review should the Eleventh Circuit have applied, abuse of discretion, or some de novo review, or a combination of the two?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_h_babington" startTime="289.412" stopTime="310.854">
            <label>Mr. Joseph H. Babington</label>
            <text syncTime="289.412" offset="1305128">--Well, I think it would be a combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.372" offset="1312965">Certainly as to the standard that should be applied, that's a question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.616" offset="1333863">Our point is that the Eleventh Circuit erred in how it interpreted this Court's Daubert decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.158" offset="1356015">In footnote 8 in Daubert, this Court said, our discussion is limited to the scientific context, because that was what was before the Court.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="310.854" offset="1390810">Well, certainly Daubert itself indicated that it was dealing there with some kind of scientific evidence, and it didn't purport to establish some global principles of the four factors in every case, did it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_h_babington" startTime="326.435" stopTime="343.847">
            <label>Mr. Joseph H. Babington</label>
            <text syncTime="326.435" offset="1453190">Well, the... what we contend the Court did in Daubert was to set forth general, broad, common sense criteria that courts can use to determine the reliability of a broad range of expert testimony.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="343.847" stopTime="380.201">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="343.847" offset="1522781">Well, there's a lot of discussion about whether we should look to a standard that directs the trial judge's attention to indicia of reliability in the field at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.375" offset="1572936">I mean, what is it regarding this issue in the field that is recognized as legitimate for an inquiry?</text>
            <text syncTime="367.000" offset="1615463">Now, is there anything in this record to show that the district court made any findings on the indicia of reliability that prevail in the tire manufacturing field?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_h_babington" startTime="380.201" stopTime="469.953">
            <label>Mr. Joseph H. Babington</label>
            <text syncTime="380.201" offset="1668230">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.862" offset="1670843">If you look at the district court's opinion on reconsideration, I think it's specifically discussed in the joint appendix at pages 91 and 92.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.418" offset="1701145">The district court considered the respondents' argument that the respondents' expert did the same thing as the petitioners' expert, and that there was evidence in the record that supported the view that what the respondents' expert did was commonly accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.670" offset="1774079">Everyone did it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.200" offset="1780244">And the district court specifically rejected that, saying that the evidence before the court did not establish that.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.216" offset="1808247">At most, all it established was that the two experts used the same method of... or technique of gathering data, and that's really not that surprising.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.961" offset="1843251">You should look first to the product in question to gather your data.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.074" offset="1855685">What most troubled the district court was the methodology, how the experts got from the information on which they were basing their opinion to their ultimate conclusion, and as this Court pointed out in Joiner, the ipse dixit of the expert is insufficient to support the ultimate conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.605" offset="1933844">There must be some objective validation or criteria that the district court can look to.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.809" offset="1958712">How does the district court otherwise know that the expert's not just making it up, and that's really the point of our argument, that the district court, in answering that central question, should be allowed to ask the logical, common sense questions that flow out of this Court's Daubert criteria.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="469.953" stopTime="474.735">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="469.953" offset="2027257">Well, does the record show the district court looked at anything other than the four Daubert factors?</text>

            <text syncTime="474.735" offset="2046379">Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.267" offset="2052544">What the district court did was consider the fact, the logical flaws in the respondents' expert's approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.940" offset="2079189">For example, that even though he had a methodology, he didn't even apply the methodology in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.584" offset="2097788">Instead of physically examining the tire first, he looked at photographs of the tire, and he admitted that he didn't know whether his past analyses of failed tires had ever been correct.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="499.593" offset="2145853">Mr. Babington, there's circulating now a proposed revision of Rule 702, and that is set forth in the appendix to the respondents' brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.709" offset="2190262">It says there are three things to look at, 1) the reliability of the facts, the reliability of the principles and method, and finally the reliability of the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.118" offset="2239894">Would you think that that's an adequate statement?</text>
            <text syncTime="526.980" offset="2255359">You tell us that the Eleventh Circuit is no good because they removed all of the standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.955" offset="2279287">Daubert, on the other hand, has these four factors, and the district court did organize its decision under those.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.779" offset="2310529">But suppose we had, instead... suppose the district court or the Eleventh Circuit had said, Daubert is too rigid, we like these standards, would that be acceptable?</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph H. Babington</label>
            <text syncTime="553.906" offset="2363088">Well, we think that the proposed rule merely is an attempt to put down more clearly the existing law, is what I understand that the advisory committee is attempting to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.426" offset="2409168">It is a mere proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.084" offset="2411780">It hasn't been acted on yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.055" offset="2415646">But that standard is an effort by the advisory committee to put down in the rules what the lower courts have thought about how they should assess reliability of expert testimony following this Court's landmark Daubert decision, and under the new rule, or under the... so to answer your question, the answer really wouldn't be any different.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.430" offset="2509164">The Daubert criteria, broadly understood and flexibly applied, lead to exactly the type of questions that the district court asked of this expert to determine if his testimony was more than just his say-so, more than just guesswork or speculation.</text>

            <text syncTime="605.911" offset="2571127">What you are saying, Mr. Babington, I take it, is that the Daubert opinion dealt with kind of scientific peer review type of evidence, but that the gatekeeper function extends beyond that to anything covered by Rule 702 when it's dealing with expert evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.309" offset="11740629">Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, I believe again the Joiner case is a good example where the district court judge had to make a judgment call on what criteria is appropriate to this health case based on exposure, and that should be reviewed for abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.600" offset="11797785">I believe that will be a fairly rare case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.701" offset="11806248">You take a tire failure expert, these gentlemen basically do the same thing, and if the court, the trial court makes the inquiry initially to the parties, what's this expert about, what is this testimony about, he's probably going to get fairly similar criteria, and that can be borne out in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.792" offset="11874585">Like in this case, there's no evidence saying this protocol is not proper.</text>

            <text syncTime="2954.880" offset="11966954">I guess the... in my mind, anyway, I think the hardest question for you would be, you'd say, well, look, there is a theory going on here that in the absence of these four specific factors, not any kind of abuse but four kinds, beading, flange, whitewall discoloration, and some other thing, that your expert seems to say, in the absence of those four things, it must have been defect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3020.816" offset="12230686">My response to that question would be, the two nail holes, it's being run a long time, it's not the best tire on earth, that goes to the weight and not the admissibility of this testimony, and this testimony is certainly reliable, because this expert did consider the nail holes, he did consider the bald spot, and he had an answer for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.206" offset="12300276">It may not be an answer that the jury believes, but it's based on reliable experience with the leader in the tire industry, namely, Michelin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.109" offset="12327862">They paid for that type of work for 10 years while he was at Michelin, and that goes to the soul of 702, knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.687" offset="12366209">And it didn't say knowledge based on joining a science club or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.990" offset="12379375">Knowledge can be based on knowledge, under Rule 702.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.723" offset="12394317">It can be based on experience, or skill, or training, or education, and those factors go to the inquiry of the relevancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.906" offset="12423052">And then does his testimony fit?</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.039" offset="12431620">Well, certainly it fits, because he saw this same thing happen, so he says, at Michelin, and again, if that's not good enough for the jury, that's fine, but 702 is to enable the jury to hear all of this testimony and then the judge should determine, have we sustained our burden, producing enough evidence to get it to the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3194.284" offset="12924603">On the same page where the judge said he didn't like our analytical leap from the evidence to the conclusion, he cited the Diviero case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3286.846" offset="13294810">But I believe the trial judge saw the word, methodology, and immediately leaped into Daubert, and when he could not see an objective test, or objective validation, then he had a big problem with this testimony.</text>
