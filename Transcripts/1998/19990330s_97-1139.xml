            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="9.878" offset="125687">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.358" offset="151601">Respondent and his cohorts committed a crime of kidnapping that began in Texas and was carried out among other places in New Jersey, New York, and Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.353" offset="199561">At one point while in Maryland respondent used a 357 magnum revolver to threaten the hostagesâ€™ life.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.556" offset="236342">He was arrested and tried along with several codefendants in United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on charges of kidnapping and using and carrying a firearm during and and in relation to the kidnapping in violation of 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="57.447" offset="315963">Respondent moved to dismiss the firearm charge arguing that venue for the charge was proper solely in Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.277" offset="347206">The only place where the government can prove that he used the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.218" offset="367059">The District Court denied the motion but on a two to one vote, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.027" offset="394226">It held that the 924(c)(1) charge offense is committed only where defendant actually uses or carries a gun and hence could only be prosecuted in that place and for our purposes that would be Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.794" offset="453263">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.202" offset="466951">The Constitution requires that crimes be tried in the place where they were committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.337" offset="491506">As we confirmed just last term in United States versus Cabrales, the location of an offense must be determined from the nature of the crime alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.110" offset="542601">The firearm offebnse at issue here provides that whoever during and in relation to any crime of violence uses or carries a firearm, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.687" offset="588890">The offense contains two essential conduct elements: using or carrying a firearm and committing a crime of violence, in this case kidnapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.118" offset="634657">As the Court explains the United States vresus Lombardo, where crime consist of distinct parts which have different localities the whole maybe tried where any part can be proved to have been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.361" offset="691604">Here respondent used the gun in Maryland during and in relation to a kidnapping offense that began in Texas and continued in New York, New Jersey, and Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.803" offset="729325">Kidnapping was committed in all of the places that any part of it took place and venue for the kidnapping charge was therefore proper in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.594" offset="764538">The firearm charge was incorporated to kidnapping as a conduct element of the offense could be tried there as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.726" offset="797034">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Stevens has joined.</text>
