            <text syncTime="1812.435" offset="7391581">Well, Justice Ginsburg, in the Gilmer decision this Court brought up three issues which were not before the Court in Gilmer, and said that those three issues represented grounds upon which Alexander had continuing vitality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.616" offset="7468277">Two of those grounds, I would respectfully submit, are distinctions without a difference, one being the presumption in favor of arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act, which in my careful reading of this Court's decisions seems to be totally the same as the presumption in favor of labor arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.401" offset="7555421">The second was the question of, in Alexander and in Barrentine and in McDonald, the three cases that were characterized by this Court as Alexander and its progeny, the question was, what is the binding effect in terms of res judicata, collateral estoppel, issue preclusion, fact preclusion, whatever you want to call them, of an already completed arbitration award, or arbitration decision which you cannot tell from the record of the case considered the discrimination question whatsoever, and so it is certainly possible to continue to distinguish Alexander on those two bases or on the basis... on the second ground, and never get to a need to overrule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1924.678" offset="7840574">It says, yeah, you've got your good old title VII right in court with a jury trial, but you have to wait and go to arbitration, and then whatever the result is, if you don't like it, come to court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1936.897" offset="7889370">--Well, the question of scope of review was, of course, addressed in a sense in Alexander by saying there can be no estoppel effect whatsoever, so there is nothing to review, but the question of the scope of review of an arbitration award involving statutory claims is, of course, not properly presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.741" offset="7976828">It is... that's one which has been litigated in great detail in other cases which I certainly presume are going to find their way in this direction sooner or later, and I think that one of the most instructive decisions in that regard is Judge Edwards' decision in the Cole case in the D.C. Circuit, in which he advocates a heightened scrutiny standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.590" offset="8092185">Because after all, rather than deferring to the arbitrator's contract interpretation in a statutory claim arbitration the arbitrator is, at least in some sense, resolving either questions of law or mixed questions of law and fact which go beyond the terms of the contract per se and, therefore, a court would be empowered to determine whether, in fact, the procedures employed in the arbitration, the remedies available to the grievant in the arbitration comported with title VII, the ADEA, and the Americans with Disabilities Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2590.359" offset="10503287">My question is, given that history, and given what Justice Scalia said, that we're not dealing with an individual here, we're dealing with a group of people who may or may not be focusing on what's in this particular collective bargaining agreement, and given ambiguous language in that agreement, why should there not be a presumption that there is no delegation of authority in the union to settle such claims, which are not like typical CBA claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="2630.234" offset="10662739">So given all that, why wouldn't we say under 301 in the discrimination area there is a presumption that the claim is not delegated to the union to settle unless it pretty clearly... you know, like a first options type of language, unless it pretty clearly says that it is, and that would solve the problem, perhaps not the way you would like it solved, but what is the objection, legally, to doing that?</text>

            <text syncTime="3304.091" offset="13358157">I doubt that very seriously, because since the third Boys Markets injunction we obtained there have been no further wildcat strikes, so I think that the message has gotten across, and therefore I believe... and we've had numerous arbitrations since then that were not required by... or several arbitrations that were not required by court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.103" offset="13434226">With that in mind, I think that the appropriate focus really is, should it make any difference that Ceasar Wright was a longshoreman covered by a collective bargaining agreement rather than a foreman working for the same stevedoring contractor in the port of Charleston.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.406" offset="13519490">If one had an arbitration clause that was incorporated in an application for employment, or an employee handbook, or a policy and procedure manual, while this Court certainly hasn't squarely addressed any of those issues, it would seem to me that the clear weight of Gilmer would be that this agreement, quote unquote, reached without bargaining by the individual would be binding upon him or her as a forum choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.908" offset="13645400">Why should not an agreement reached between an employer and a collective bargaining representative who is obligated under statute and under Federal common law to provide a duty of fair representation to the employee receive a similar degree of deference?</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.120" offset="13722304">We think that the result is quite clear, and that whatever continuing vitality there might be to Alexander has been so severely undermined both by the course of this Court's decisions and by changes in the historic framework, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.343" offset="13799209">In 1974, this Court was concerned with massive, systemic discrimination by employers and labor organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.661" offset="13840482">We have come a long way since that time, and during that period of time it's instructive in my view to note that labor organizations have been accorded standing to represent the rights of members of collective bargaining units in asserting claims under title VII and other antidiscrimination statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.074" offset="13922089">So if they can do that in court, why can't they do it in arbitration?</text>
