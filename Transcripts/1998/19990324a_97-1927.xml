            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="179532">We'll hear argument now in two cases that have been consolidated for argument: No. 97-1927, Rodney C. Hanlon, et al. v. Paul W. Berger; and 98-83, Charles H. Wilson v. Harry Layne.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Cordray</label>
            <text syncTime="19.528" offset="257586">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="22.080" offset="267826">I represent the Marshals Service officers in Wilson and all the officials in Hanlon.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.032" offset="283604">There are two issues in these cases: the constitutional issue itself and the further issue of whether in any event these officers should be held personally liable for money damages when, at the time they acted, the law was not clearly established and it was not apparent that their conduct violated the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.142" offset="343999">We submit that however the Court decides the constitutional issue is a matter of first impression in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.445" offset="365210">Mitchell v. Forsyth compels the result that qualified immunity should be upheld for these officers here.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.015" offset="387571">Turning first to the constitutional issue, as framed by the Court, the issue is whether law enforcement officials violate the Fourth Amendment when they permit members of the news media to accompany them in order to observe and report on their execution of a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.507" offset="441488">We submit that it would be wrong to erect a per se rule that in all circumstances such conduct is improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.327" offset="464789">Certainly to the extent that the search in the Hanlon case involved open fields or had the arrest of Dominic Wilson occurred in a public place, it would be unproblematic that the media accompanied the officers and observed and reported on their execution of a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.036" offset="519646">As a larger matter, moreover, there are many instances throughout this country every day in which third parties accompany officers as they execute warrants, and this has been true since the inception of bench warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.092" offset="559875">There are many different circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.878" offset="566980">They may be there to join in performing the search or the seizure in assistance of the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.680" offset="586206">They may assist the officers in other more tangential ways: provide clerical help, translating, identifying evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.686" offset="610239">They may also help facilitate the law enforcement objectives that are served by procuring and implementing the warrant itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1573.646" offset="6474102">There are two fundamental facts that establish the qualified immunity of the three deputy sheriffs I represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.066" offset="6499702">The first of those is that the most able lawyer researching this issue in 1992 would have found no cases from any court condemning the mere presence of media when a warrant is executed lawfully as a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.142" offset="6560097">The only cases then in existence, in fact, held to the contrary, that media presence at most was a tort under common law principles if... if the media was brought inside a home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.450" offset="6605236">The second point is that--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1608.485" offset="6613387">May I ask... suppose it had been clearly established that it was a common law tort to bring the media into a home, but there had been no decision on interpreting section 1983 or the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.293" offset="6664691">Would you think under those... under that assumption there would be qualified immunity?</text>

            <text syncTime="1626.130" offset="6684022">I think it would still be an open question whether... whether this Court would eventually incorporate those common law principles into the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1637.921" offset="6731147">The only issue we have to face is, should the officers have been aware that they shouldn't go in if their only restraint on going in was a well-established common law rule... a common law tort rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1649.729" offset="6778376">No, because the... the doctrine of qualified immunity would operate only as to the constitutional principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.197" offset="6800319">There may be other immunities for the officers concerning the common law, and in fact, one... one could find the situation where the common law would... would suggest to these officers that they should not do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.904" offset="6843055">But as a matter of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence and the Bivens or 1983 action against the officers, I think the law would still not be clearly established as a matter of constitutional principle.</text>

            <text syncTime="1706.148" offset="7004074">The technical issue of trespass may be such that in the absence of a warrant, something would clearly be a trespass.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.819" offset="7034794">But if the officer is in the position under Fourth Amendment jurisprudence of having authority to come into the house based on a warrant, then that potential superior authority of the officer would overcome the tort violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1734.983" offset="7119431">You... you run up against the person in a way a court says there wasn't... that wouldn't make it invalid under the Fourth Amendment, would it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1742.138" offset="7148061">You... you would still have the issue under the Fourth Amendment, but whether that use of force, which might admittedly be... be a battery at common law, is justified by the need to control, under Michigan v. Summers, the people who are in the... the premises where the warrant is being executed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1757.348" offset="7208874">There occurs to me an even better answer than that which is that the open fields doctrine explicitly says that you can commit a tort and not violate the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1772.841" offset="7270836">But in fact, this case, the Wilson case, provides a good illustration of where they don't overlap and where I think there's an important distinction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1828.177" offset="7492146">I mean, if the lesser is forbidden, why isn't it obvious that the greater is?</text>
