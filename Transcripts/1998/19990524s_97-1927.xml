            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="85785">The second case I have to announce is No. 97-1927, Hanlon against Berger which is the companion case to Wilson against Layne.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.146" offset="130298">In this case agents of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service search the ranch and its outbuildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.785" offset="156838">While accompanied by a CNN camera crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.224" offset="170631">This case, it raises the same issues as Wilson against Layne does.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.800" offset="188916">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the agents violated the clearly established Fourth Amendment rights of the homeowners.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.212" offset="218592">Under our holding today in Wilson that right was not clearly established at the time of this search which was also in the early part of the 90s.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.163" offset="250356">The agents are therefore entitled to qualify the immunity and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.836" offset="277106">Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
