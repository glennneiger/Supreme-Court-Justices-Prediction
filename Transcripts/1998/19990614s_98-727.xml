            <text syncTime="8.833" offset="121147">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.056" offset="146015">Involves a question, what happens to when an attorney is sanctioned from his conduct doing discovery, can that attorney appeal that even though the case continuous on?</text>
            <text syncTime="27.913" offset="197424">Petitioner is an attorney who initially represented a plaintiff and sued against respondent and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.989" offset="221770">After petitioner failed to obey certain pretrial discovery orders, a Magistrate judge directed her to pay monetary sanctions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="46.078" offset="270045">A District Court affirmed the sanctions order and also disqualified petitioner as plaintiff's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.552" offset="295958">While the suit went forward as I indicated petitioner immediately appealed the sanctions order.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.408" offset="319364">The Court of Appeals dismissed her appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.762" offset="336813">It held that the Rule 37(a) sanctions order did not fall within a narrow category of orders known as collateral orders, which maybe appealed prior to the entry of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.342" offset="387178">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.444" offset="403582">28 U.S.C. Section 1291 gives federal appellate courts with the jurisdiction over appeals from final decisions of the District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.158" offset="446423">We have interpreted this provision to mean that an appeal ordinarily will not lie until the District Court has entered final judgment unless the order being appealed is a collateral order.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.109" offset="494175">A collateral order is conclusive, resolves an important question completely separate from the merits and is effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.409" offset="547465">We hold today that a Rule 37(a) sanctions order does not qualify as a collateral order, and thus is not the final decision under Section 1291.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.257" offset="594799">Review of sanctions orders often will be an inextricably intertwined with the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.182" offset="618518">Moreover, an attorney suffers no undue hardship from deferring appellate consideration of a Rule 37(a) sanction which unlike a contempt finding is not designed to compel immediate compliance with an order of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.518" offset="679853">Our conclusion that a Rule 37(a) sanctions order is not a final decision, applies even where as here the attorney no longer participates in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.133" offset="722276">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.347" offset="731158">Justice Kennedy has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
