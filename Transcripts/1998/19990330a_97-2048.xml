            <text syncTime="289.251" offset="1296232">And that analogy breaks down in prior Seventh Circuit decisions, one of which is cited in this decision, called Hogan V. McBride, which is an Indiana case, and Gomoz v. DiTello, which is an Illinois case.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.141" offset="1339804">That's what the Seventh Circuit tried to do, to see whether there would be a default under Illinois law for failure to take a petition for leave to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.461" offset="1369061">The analogy would run that State habeas, which is called post-conviction in Illinois, is somehow analogous to Federal habeas.</text>

            <text syncTime="404.570" offset="1757554">The feature here is that the... that the statute providing... I'm sorry... that the rules of the court that implement this discretionary avenue of appeal to the State supreme court give some examples of the sorts of things that they are interested in in exercising their discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.448" offset="1829025">And as the... as the I think the Chief justice alluded to a moment ago, they... they sound like... they sound like sort of, for lack of a better term, broad policy questions, path-breaking kinds of questions, rather than fact or case-specific questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="454.019" offset="1955354">When a State gives signals, as I think the Illinois Supreme Court has given signals, about what it is interested in, why then shouldn't the rule be that if your case does not fall within the kinds of examples that the State supreme court says it's interested in, you don't have to exhaust because it would be futile to do it, or almost always futile?</text>
