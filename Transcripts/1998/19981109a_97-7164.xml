            <text syncTime="65.608" offset="403436">This case presents an issue of fundamental importance to the administration of criminal justice in our Nation, whether judicial expansion of an unambiguous statute based ostensibly on legislative purpose should be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.570" offset="475325">The Second Circuit's holding that the Federal carjacking statute encompasses the unstated and expansive mens rea element of conditional intent must be reversed, as it contravenes the plain and unequivocal language of the statute and thus violates this Court's longstanding canons of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.833" offset="564350">This alone forecloses the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.304" offset="578247">Moreover, if legislative history is relevant, and we think it is not, the legislative history does not support a finding of conditional intent in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.029" offset="625163">In fact, a clear reading of the legislative history reveals that Congress could not have intended this statute to be a conditional intent statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.801" offset="668213">Finally, the Government's assertion that the concept of conditional intent can simply be read into the specific intent element, as there is a traditional recognition of the concept in our country in statutes analogous to the carjacking statute is a complete fiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="160.404" offset="782629">I don't find many cases dealing with the so-called conditional intent, but intent is very broad, and is it possible that someone who stops a motorist with a gun, saying, give me your keys, and pointing the gun at him, could be said... could the fact-finder find intent to cause death or serious bodily injury from that--</text>

            <text syncTime="192.641" offset="911570">The answer is no, Your Honor, and that's precisely why the district court improperly instructed the jury on conditional intent, because the district court realized that that would not satisfy the intent element.</text>

            <text syncTime="210.751" offset="983981">And if the circumstances are the use of a deadly weapon and the demand for the keys and the vehicle and the use of the weapon in hand, I would think the jury could find intent to cause serious injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.842" offset="1128386">In fact, it's mutually exclusive.</text>

            <text syncTime="267.255" offset="1209993">They might well choose not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.272" offset="1218143">It seems to me what the case here turns on is what is the meaning of the statutory intent, not what a jury could find from a proper charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.214" offset="1365891">It seems to me that your answer to Justice O'Connor should have been that the Government must have proof of a fixed intent to injure, no matter, and that given her hypothetical there was just not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.175" offset="1437676">And if that's the answer... I think that has to be your answer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1607.830" offset="6572304">The carjacking statute makes it a Federal crime to take a car from a person by force or intimidation with intent to cause death or serious bodily harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.887" offset="6624549">Petitioner suggests that the statute only punishes carjackers who intend to cause death or serious bodily harm whether or not their victims resist, but that interpretation makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.164" offset="6677630">The way this phrase came into the statute, the traditional meaning of the phrase used in this way in penal codes and at common law, and the structure of the statute, all show that Congress could not have used the word intent with that limited meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.907" offset="6736667">I'd like to talk about the way the phrase came into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.026" offset="6749101">In 1992, Congress made it a crime to take a car by force and violence or intimidation from a person while possessing a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.048" offset="6785150">In 1994, Congress took out the firearm and substituted the requirement of intent to cause death or serious bodily harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.535" offset="6815139">When they took out the firearm requirement, as several justices have noticed, they thought they were broadening the statute, not narrowing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.391" offset="6850561">The supporters of the amendment wanted to reach the carjacker who drags the victim along behind the car, or who uses a knife or a pipe or some other instrument rather than a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.199" offset="6889849">The original proposal was to take out the firearm requirement without putting anything new in, but Congress eventually decided to replace one limitation with another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.638" offset="6927570">It substituted a dangerous state of mind for a dangerous weapon, so that Federal carjackings would continue to be those that present a serious risk of death or serious bodily harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.112" offset="6969470">And precisely what that condition rules out is the extremely common, not at all uncommon practice of committing a robbery with an unloaded gun or a water pistol or a toy gun, or a finger in a pocket purporting to be a gun, a frightening experience but not one that risks killing someone the way committing a robbery with a weapon, under the old statute, or with intent to kill, under the new statute does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.215" offset="7089842">Both of those, those are alternative ways of restricting Federal carjacking to the most dangerous sorts of carjacking.</text>
