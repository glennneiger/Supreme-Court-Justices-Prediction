            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="143148">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 98-436, John Alden v. Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.437" offset="172823">Mr. Gold.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="laurence_e_gold" startTime="8.689" stopTime="173.539">
            <label>Mr. Laurence E. Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="8.689" offset="177839">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.774" offset="210230">The question in this case, which we have referred to in our briefs as the Article I State sovereign immunity question, is generated by and can only be answered by reference to the unique sovereignty scheme of our Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.546" offset="277313">That scheme divides sovereignty between the United States and the States, subdivides the sovereign authority of the United States among the three branches of the National Government, makes the sovereign legislative authority of the United States within its sphere supreme, and provides a dual role for the State courts in the enforcement of the entire law, both Federal and State.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.915" offset="390789">The question here is predicated on the following case.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.412" offset="428719">After their Federal court Fair Labor Standards Act overtime pay case was dismissed on Eleventh Amendment grounds and as specifically provided for in the FLSA, the State employee plaintiffs here began this proceeding by bringing an FLSA case against the State of Maine in the Superior Court of Cumberland County, Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.792" offset="546270">Maine in its answer answered entered an affirmative defense of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.834" offset="566436">The superior court granted Maine's motion for judgment on that defense, and the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine in a 4 to 2 decision affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.143" offset="615651">In this Court, Maine's submission in defending the decision below is that the FLSA provision for State employee overtime pay suits against a State in State court is not a valid law because it transgresses a constitutional constraint on Congress' Article I legislative power, one that puts it beyond Congress' authority to provide for the enforcement of a valid Federal statute through State liability rules that override State sovereign immunity rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.711" offset="781894">The framework for the issue presented is provided by this Court's Garcia decision and its decision in Howlett v. Rose.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.787" offset="826198">As to Garcia--</text>

            <text syncTime="177.692" offset="853888">It was a suit against a municipality, and all we argue is that its method of approach frames the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.467" offset="892967">Then the ultimate question becomes the one that the State raises whether a suit against a State where the State claims sovereign immunity is in a different category or class than a suit against a municipality where the municipality claims State sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.255" offset="992128">And that question turns on... not on the analytic structure of Howlett, which would treat both the same, but as the State recognizes, on whether State sovereign immunity, when claimed by the State, is of a different and constitutional dimension, a dimension which would make the Federal law invalid and thereby--</text>

            <text syncTime="370.779" offset="1626172">Yes, and the... the State does concede that, and indeed as this Court has made clear, so that we're not overstating anything, the suit by the United States could be in Federal court as well as in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.948" offset="1690851">There is no bar to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.090" offset="1695448">But the question is whether Congress is constrained by some constitutional principle from providing that which the sovereign can normally provide for enforcement through the usual processes of the law by the right holder in the law created by the sovereign.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="417.078" stopTime="487.314">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="417.078" offset="1811432">Well, it is a constitutional principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.382" offset="1820627">Mr. Gold, one... I just can't conceive of the Constitution being ratified if it were thought that the States could be sued as States in their own courts, and to that extent, I understand the Eleventh Amendment as being confirmatory of the original understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.489" offset="1925012">Of course, it's an amendment, and we know that amendments are done to change the original understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.281" offset="1952180">But in this case I think it was the original understanding and that's what puzzles me in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.764" offset="1974123">And of course, we know the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendment made a dividing line and federalism for those actions were changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.889" offset="1994603">But this isn't under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment, and it comes back to this basic constitutional principle which I think teaches something, maybe not very much if the Federal Government can, in effect, get around our opinion by withholding grants in aid or suing on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.420" offset="2068790">But it seems... I have... I have trouble conceiving of the Constitution being ratified under your theory.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="laurence_e_gold" startTime="487.314" stopTime="605.942">
            <label>Mr. Laurence E. Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="487.314" offset="2092301">Well, if... if I can, Justice Kennedy, it seems to me that what we see with regard to the original understanding is two points, and I don't think they lead to the conclusion that there is some implicit constitutional limit on Congress' sovereign authority that runs in favor... that limits Congress in its sovereign power and runs in favor of the States as to a matter where the State isn't sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.922" offset="2258753">I don't want to engage in word play, but what the claim is here, that there is something never seen before, namely, a limit on a true sovereign in favor of a... an entity who is certainly a governing authority and an important governing authority and a sovereign in many regards, but runs in favor of that governing entity in an aspect of the overall scheme in which the State or that governing entity is not sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.581" offset="2429385">That is a wholly extraordinary notion, one which we would think had to have some express understanding, and it's quite different from the concerns and interests that animated what we know of the fidelity to State sovereign immunity.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="605.942" offset="2566893">But, you know, you say it's an extraordinary notion, but the whole... the whole system of... of dual sovereignty and dual citizenship was an extraordinary notion.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.369" offset="2604614">I mean, it is extraordinary.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence E. Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="616.999" offset="2611092">Right, but... and as the Eleventh Amendment shows, in making adjustments to deal with the new aspects of that extraordinary situation, there was what I think would have to be seen as an entirely new concept adjusted to the situation to preserve a form of... or to create a form of State sovereign immunity which would not have obtained by simple extrapolation from the law of nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.811" offset="2798338">And that's the Eleventh Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="679.470" offset="2860928">And the argument you're making now would make a lot of sense if you were saying, you know, really the Federal Government has its hands... hands tied unless this aspect of State sovereign immunity were automatically eliminated by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.820" offset="2914426">And in fact, it hasn't had its hands tied.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.392" offset="2924666">It can... it can achieve its ends in... in various other ways, and I think it's significant that, you know, it's been 200 and... and what... some odd years before... before this issue has even come before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.640" offset="2989659">Apparently the Federal Government hasn't found it very needful to proceed in this fashion in order to achieve its... its necessary objectives.</text>

            <text syncTime="954.612" offset="3961519">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="962.308" offset="3992343">When the Founders adopted the Constitution, they conferred the Article I powers upon Congress immediately, but they left it optional whether Federal... lower Federal courts would be... ever be created.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.958" offset="4042916">So, how did they expect that the Article I powers would be effectuated?</text>
            <text syncTime="979.231" offset="4060052">The answer is provided by the text of the Supremacy Clause, which makes the Constitution and laws of the United States the supreme law of the land and provides that, quote, the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.684" offset="4141868">In the context of the document as a whole, this must include authority for Congress to provide remedies in State courts, otherwise the great Article I powers would have been written in disappearing ink.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.013" offset="4199128">The State relies in this case on an asserted constitutional or pre constitutional right of sovereign immunity in its own courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.450" offset="4236849">But as Justice Holmes explained for this unanimous Court in 1907, sovereignty belongs to, quote, the authority that makes the law upon which the right depends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.237" offset="4284079">With respect to Federal claims, the sovereign is not the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.909" offset="4302782">It is the Nation, and therefore, as this Court explained in Hilton, when a Federal statute imposes liability upon the States, quote, the Supremacy Clause makes that law the law in every State enforceable fully in State court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1138.735" offset="4698067">I... I would suggest that Howlett itself announced two principles that we think are quite fundamental to this case and, understood in the context of this Court's decision in Hilton, I think strongly suggest the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.784" offset="4754283">The principles are, number one, that a State court may not deny a Federal right absent a valid excuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.577" offset="4785421">And number two, that an excuse that is inconsistent with or violates Federal law is not a valid excuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.054" offset="4823350">Now, in Hilton, this Court considered the applicability of the Fair Labor Standards Act, whether the fair... whether a claim could be brought under the Federal Employers Liability Act in State court, when under Welch the Eleventh Amendment barred such a suit in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.856" offset="4894508">And the State argued in its brief and before this Court that because the State was entitled to a sovereign immunity in its own courts of a constitutional significance equal to the Eleventh Amendment, the unmistakably clear principle of Atascadero and Welch had to be applied and therefore the State remedy wasn't available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.182" offset="4983847">And this Court rejected that proposition over a strong dissent that adopted the State's argument, and the majority opinion held that, no, the question... the clear statement requirement that has to be applied in this case is the... is the requirement in Pennhurst and Gregory v. Ashcroft, that is one of pure statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.274" offset="5068170">And we don't have to apply that pure statutory construction question in the case because pardon establishes another rule of statutory construction, that is, stare decisis, and we therefore hold that that remedy is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.115" offset="5131595">Now, Mr. Chief Justice, you are quite right that this Court's decision in Hilton doesn't decide the precise question that's before this Court, but I suggest to the Court, most respectfully, that the discussion in Hilton about the consequence of denying a right in State court against the... the Eleventh Amendment backdrop in which no right would be available in Federal court, would be that the plaintiffs would be denied a right at all, and it would have been I think... I suggest... rather surprising to the Court to understand that there was some sovereign immunity principle in State court that could trump that concern.</text>

            <text syncTime="1294.606" offset="5321558">Well, what I think... I think it's... it's quite significant, Mr. Chief Justice, that the way this Court concluded its opinion in Howlett was to say, quote, that when a Federal statute does impose liability upon the States... I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.848" offset="5386446">Hilton... the Supremacy Clause makes that law the law in every State fully enforceable in State court, and it cited as support for that proposition the Court's unanimous decision the term before in Howlett.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.047" offset="5443288">And I suggest that that strongly implies that what the Court concluded was that if the State had, as it claimed it had, a sovereign immunity of constitutional significance, this Court would have been required under its prior decisions to apply the constitutional rule of... of utterly clear statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.002" offset="5551122">I can't... unmistakably clear statement as a matter of constitutional law, notwithstanding pardon.</text>

            <text syncTime="1518.411" offset="6216722">This Court explained in Nevada v. Hall, referring back to Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, the proposition that there are... that the notion of sovereign immunity is really an amalgam of two different types of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.582" offset="6273460">This Court said in Nevada v. Hall, the doctrine of sovereign immunity is an amalgam of two quite different concepts: one applicable to suits in the sovereign's own courts and the other two suits in the courts of another sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.921" offset="6330825">The former is absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.601" offset="6337512">The latter was always a matter of comity, always until the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.905" offset="6358724">And the reason for this is the nature of sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.467" offset="6372934">That is, sovereignty is the right to make the substantive law upon which the right depends.</text>

Hall and which is not the issue in any of this Court's Eleventh Amendment cases... those are all suits about the other kind of sovereignty which doesn't depend on the sovereign being the law giver and which were always a matter of comity until, in the Plan of Convention, it was made absolute by a constriction or an interpretation of the scope of Article III.</text>
