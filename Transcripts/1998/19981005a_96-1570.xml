            <label>Mr. James R. Young</label>
            <text syncTime="9.567" offset="180980">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.970" offset="194564">In explaining why the Second Circuit was wrong, I'd like to focus on two legal principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.773" offset="217761">The first is that an antitrust case brought by a disappointed supplier must contain adequate allegations of harm to competition and not just harm to the competitor, and the second is that that harm-to-competition requirement is not met simply by an allegation that the supplier was terminated for a bad reason, even if that reason is in violation of laws other than the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.480" offset="316608">The lower courts have repeatedly used these principles to deal efficiently and appropriately with meritless but tempting treble damage antitrust suits brought by suppliers and distributors in the lower courts and, in doing so, they have been consistent with the principles of GTE Sylvania and Sharp, because the very cost of this litigation alone...  these cases go on for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.295" offset="415873">The expenses are tremendous.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.646" offset="421307">These costs are a tremendous chill on the right to, a purchaser's right to change suppliers freely, which is the essence of the competitive process.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.922" offset="462371">The Second Circuit made a substantive error.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.577" offset="480970">It extended group boycott law to cover a vertical nonprice agreement despite the clear requirement that a group boycott requires a horizontal agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.903" offset="522348">Now, the second circuit made this error apparently because it confused an alleged regulatory fraud in the telephone services market, the aim of which was to raise local telephone rates, for a competitive problem, but this case has nothing to do with rivalry among providers of local telephone service.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.075" offset="598939">Discon in its brief acknowledges that.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.216" offset="607508">Now, apparently, because of this confusion the Second Circuit did not even examine whether there were concrete allegations of market-wide harm to competition in the removal services market, which is the only relevant market here.</text>

            <text syncTime="150.812" offset="745957">It seems to me if you have a monopolist that's the buyer and the agreement is to eliminate all but one supplier, and if you assume that those costs are going to be passed on to the consumer, I don't know why that isn't part of the competitive analysis, at least under the rule of reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.641" offset="861209">The question is, what were the terms of rivalry in the removal services market, and that's really where the Second Circuit I think missed the boat.</text>

            <text syncTime="264.530" offset="1200801">One picture that I have is an agreement that would leave only one supplier standing, and in that case, if there were only the two in the business, it would be quite a different situation than if it were just a single supplier eliminated and many still standing, so what was it?</text>

            <text syncTime="291.119" offset="1307171">There was Discon, there was AT&amp;T, there was a company called LISN, which I believe is pronounced LISN, and there was an individual named McGee.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.315" offset="1343952">All are alleged in the complaint as being in the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.385" offset="1352206">Actually, the New York Public Service Commission, which conducted a detailed inquiry into this, in the public record of that proceeding is the fact that there were, in fact, a very large number of people competing in this business.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.923" offset="1406332">To the question about price and output, though, price and output, that is, in the removal services market, that is the critical factor, but the allegation here is that New York Telephone voluntarily paid more than the market price.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.106" offset="1475086">It's the same sort of situation as if the procurement officer at NYNEX had decided to give the money to his...  to give the business to his brother-in-law and pay his brother-in-law an extra 20 percent.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>

            <text syncTime="369.782" offset="1621790">I think what matters about it is that if there is no change in the terms of rivalry in the removal services market, and I'd like to get to that in a minute, why I think that's true, then the fact that a buyer voluntarily pays more doesn't change the market price, doesn't change the market output.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.073" offset="1683021">That is unchanged.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.311" offset="1687932">The question is, if New York Telephone decided at one point that it didn't want to be a part of this alleged scheme any more, could it go into the market and get the competitive price for removal services, and it could, for I think a very fundamental reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.363" offset="1752089">This Court in Mitsushita, in talking about what market power means and the elements of market power, has indicated that barriers to entry are critical, that you can't maintain supracompetitive prices without market power without barriers to entry.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="416.743" offset="1809663">But isn't there going to be, even as you describe it, a tendency to inflate price even in the event that NYNEX tomorrow morning, or tomorrow morning after the complaint was filed, decided that it didn't want to pay that much, because it had already demonstrated that in fact it would pay an inflated price, the competitors...  I will assume for the sake of argument there were three...  knew that it would pay the inflated price, and therefore I assume there would be a tendency on their part to say, let's hold them to their inflated price, or something like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.505" offset="1944664">So the very fact that NYNEX may change its mind tomorrow morning doesn't necessarily suggest that it will return to the competitive market that it had before it showed its willingness to pay the inflated price.</text>

            <text syncTime="462.114" offset="1991161">I think the reason that it would return to the competitive price is the fact in this industry, where there are no barriers to entry, the complaint alleges not just that these people were in the market, but that this business can and was performed by telephone companies for themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="492.523" offset="2112788">In other words, the only point that I think I'm making is that it does not seem to be implausible as a matter of law, on the allegations of the complaint, that if NYNEX changed its mind tomorrow morning, the price would necessarily return to the pre-inflation competitive price.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.514" offset="2180706">It seems to me a matter for...  at least for litigation, isn't that so?</text>

            <text syncTime="513.126" offset="2195230">No, I don't agree, and the reason I don't agree is the point I'm coming back to with barriers to entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.672" offset="2221353">The original complaint, and this is the joint appendix at page 15 to 17, indicates how easy and quick it was for somebody to get into this business, which is really just the first cousin of the salvage business.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.130" offset="2271194">Discon got into business in June of 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.684" offset="2293450">Within 30 days it had $500,000 worth of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.806" offset="2305885">It had plans to ramp up its operation here fairly dramatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.079" offset="2326992">So I think the important point is that if there are no barriers to entry, then there is absolutely no reason to suspect, and a district court faced with this kind of complaint can reasonably conclude that there is no adequate allegation here of harm to competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.812" offset="2393970">There is only an allegation that a purchaser voluntarily agreed to pay more than the market price.</text>

            <text syncTime="1339.188" offset="5499406">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.437" offset="5556458">The courts have not had experience with the kind of antitrust claim alleged in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.421" offset="5588327">It involves a regulatory evasion scheme to harm consumers by recovering inflated costs under a rate regulation system allowing recovery of costs by the regulated utility, the kind of system of rate regulation now rapidly being superseded by competitive deregulation or by systems of rate regulation such as price caps that are designed to provide greater incentives for efficiency on the part of the regulated utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.828" offset="5737957">And the allegation is of a conspiracy not just, for example, with an accountant to cook the books of the regulated utility, but with a supplier in an unregulated, what the antitrust lawyers call upstream market, the market for these removal services, and the conspiracy alleged is to monopolize that market and to exclude a competitor of that supplier of removal services from that unregulated market because competition in that market would threaten the success of the scheme that allegedly involves inflated payments to that supplier, followed by secret rebates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.972" offset="5950593">Now, we agree with petitioners that this is not properly regarded as a per se...  an allegation of a per se violation of the antitrust laws, for reasons explained in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.424" offset="6028334">Basically, we think the court of appeals got off track on that particular point by not recognizing that it has to be a type of restraint that almost always tends to restrict competition and reduce output, rather than that on the facts of a particular case it might be shown that the restraint has only anticompetitive effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.640" offset="6125196">So we agree that it's a case for rule of reason analysis under section 1, but we do think that petitioner's argument in, particularly in their brief, is too facile in trying to make almost a virtue for purposes of this case out of the regulatory evasion allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.876" offset="6230208">They say that these allegations sufficiently show the motive, a motive for the conduct that's alleged, but that the effects on consumers in the utility's own market for telephone services have to be ignored entirely because the restraint alleged is in this upstream market for removal services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.703" offset="6337519">But the very authority they cite, correctly, describing the rule of reason, this Court's decision in Business Electronics v. Sharp Electronics, quoting its decision in GTE Sylvania, says that under the rule of reason...  and this is the quote from both cases...  the factfinder weighs all the circumstances of a case in deciding whether a restrictive practice should be prohibited as imposing an unreasonable restraint on competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1581.516" offset="6468758">Well, that's true when you have identified a restraint on competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1593.493" offset="6516615">The argument being made is that there is no restraint on competition, period, that any time NYNEX itself wanted to terminate this sweetheart deal it could, and it would have in front of it a totally competitive industry, because it takes nothing to get into it.</text>
