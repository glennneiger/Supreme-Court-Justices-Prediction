            <text syncTime="60.171" offset="381930">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="63.442" offset="394991">The issue presented before the Court here reduces itself down to two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.466" offset="419128">The first and the most fundamental question is the meaning that Congress intended to the phrase invalidate, impair, or supersede as used in the McCarran Ferguson Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.696" offset="464059">Did Congress intend to afford to those words, and particularly to the word impair, its common parlance plain meaning, or did Congress intend a special, restricted meaning, as respondents and the Government have argued and as the Court below has found?</text>
            <text syncTime="97.846" offset="532604">I suggest to the Court that that critical question makes the second question easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.450" offset="563011">The second question is, under a proper reading of the word impair, and I focus on that because I think it is the critical word, under a proper reading of the word impair, as intended by Congress, is a State regulatory scheme impaired by an alternative Federal remedy that renders academic the State legislature's decision as to the appropriate remedy to be afforded for the violation of some standard?</text>
            <text syncTime="135.189" offset="682025">Those are the two questions that I believe are dispositive of the matter before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.385" offset="702818">With respect to the first question, the Court below did not attempt a parsing of the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.659" offset="735837">We do not see anything in the decision of the Ninth Circuit or of the other circuits that adopt the same view as the Ninth Circuit, no attempt to go to the words of the statute and ask, what does the word impair mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="161.637" offset="787768">What did it mean to the 79th Congress when the McCarran Ferguson Act was adopted?</text>
            <text syncTime="165.921" offset="804905">In the courts of appeal, what we had is an interpretation by analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.445" offset="827057">The McCarran Ferguson Act has about it an aspect of preemption in that it has an analogous effect and therefore the Ninth Circuit and the other circuits that go along with the Ninth Circuit have reasoned, we believe incorrectly for the reasons set forth in our briefs, that preemption and the special rules of preemption apply.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="191.997" stopTime="217.995">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="191.997" offset="909186">Well, how do you say we should look at the level of conflict between Federal and State law to determine impairment?</text>
            <text syncTime="201.844" offset="948578">I mean, one way to look at this is that the Federal RICO law gives a remedy that is not precluded by State law, and that may be supplemental but doesn't impair the State scheme.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_w_colbert_iii" startTime="217.995" stopTime="256.569">
            <label>Mr. James W. Colbert, III</label>
            <text syncTime="217.995" offset="1013257">Whether a remedy is supplemental of a State scheme or impairment of a State scheme depends upon the answer to the question of whether we take seriously the decision of the State legislature to limit remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.484" offset="1067174">If Nevada in this instance, when it had adopted the private cause of action under its State insurance law, had said, we... had put a preamble in that said, the legislature has considered and rejected enhanced damages because of a concern for impeding the solvencies of insurers for the purpose of giving windfalls to the first person to get into the courthouse door, if we had such a preamble, there could be no question--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="256.569" offset="1167484">But I thought the law didn't commute punitive damages which have no lid and could be higher than treble damages.</text>

            <label>Mr. James W. Colbert, III</label>
            <text syncTime="262.375" offset="1190786">--But the limit on punitive damages, which is critical to this issue, is that punitive damages, are not allowed where they impair the solvency of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.330" offset="1222550">You may punish, but you may not destroy, and the first goal of the insurance laws of the State of Nevada and every other State in the Union is to protect the solvency of the insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.837" offset="1272601">RICO gives no discretion to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.188" offset="1285976">Treble damages are mandatory, and if that impairs the solvency of the insurer, so be it.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.362" offset="1310635">The same is not true of punitive damages.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="294.265" offset="1318263">Well, I can understand if Nevada had passed some statutory provision in expressing its intent that its State remedies be exclusive, that this would be an impairment, but absent that, it isn't so clear to me that allowing the Federal remedy is an impairment.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.777" offset="1456294">Well, it doesn't have to, but when it's enacting its own laws it can certainly make it clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.160" offset="1477923">In the meantime, how is it an impairment?</text>

            <text syncTime="341.366" offset="1506658">Are we to now ask the Federal district courts to examine the legislative history of every portion of the insurance law in Nevada or the several States, and ask the question, did the Nevada State legislature mean it when it adopted--</text>

            <text syncTime="357.775" offset="1572382">Well, the obvious thing would be much simpler.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.888" offset="1580741">I mean, the obvious thing if you didn't know anything about it, you'd say, well, this Court held that insurance was interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.875" offset="1616790">Surprise, surprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.033" offset="1621388">And at that point Congress is worried that it might have a whole lot of laws out there that affect interstate commerce, and it doesn't want those laws to affect insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.570" offset="1659527">It doesn't want, in other words, to be taken by surprise.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="383.834" offset="1676559">So Congress simply says, look all these laws out there that we've passed, general laws affecting interstate commerce, all right, they don't preempt State insurance laws unless we specifically said so by directing limited insurance, end of the matter, period, and the only purpose that the word impair is doing there is that sometimes you could in effect impair... sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.879" offset="1760777">You could in effect preempt the State law by so wrecking it through your preemptive interpretation that although it's still on the books it's severely impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.644" offset="1795781">In other words, impair does almost nothing, not completely nothing but almost nothing, and now, if that is so, you have the purpose achieved of what you think was ordinary.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.434" offset="1843011">What's the evidence that what I just said is not the case?</text>

            <label>Mr. James W. Colbert, III</label>
            <text syncTime="428.924" offset="1856908">Well, it is perfectly plain from the debates and the enactment of the McCarran Ferguson Act that Congress was, as you've just suggested, Justice Breyer, extremely concerned about inadvertent interference with the State regulation of the business of insurance, and it's for that reason that Congress placed upon itself the burden of saying when congressional legislation would apply, the reference in the McCarran Ferguson Act to no act of Congress except that specifically related to the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.885" offset="1976758">And it is perfectly plain that Congress intended more than just antipreemption, but remember--</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="464.608" offset="1999641">It couldn't have said when it would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.799" offset="2004448">I don't mean to cut you off, but obviously the tax laws, for example, don't specifically mention insurance, but they apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.023" offset="2033287">I mean, thousands of Federal laws apply to insurance, like everything else, so Congress couldn't have meant just, we have to say specifically when Federal law applies.</text>

            <text syncTime="483.842" offset="2076650">--When... Federal law applies where the Federal rule of decision results in a different answer from the State rule of decision with respect to the business of insurance, the relationship between an insurance company and its insureds.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.952" offset="2137045">And the notion that it is somehow the burden of the State of Nevada to say, when we adopted a private remedy that allows only compensatory damages, we thought about that, we thought about whether compensatory damages would be sufficient, or whether we should have enhanced damages, the notion that McCarran Ferguson places on the States the obligation to put such preambles in the law is inconsistent with the observation you just made, Justice Breyer, which was Congress didn't want Congress to interfere by accident with the regulation of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.693" offset="2272046">Congress could have provided that RICO applies to the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.778" offset="2292317">It can do so tomorrow, but it is not Nevada's burden under the act to anticipate that Congress will adopt a statute and then have an ambiguity down the road as to whether or not the Nevada decision with respect to remedies will or will not be respected by the Federal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3275.352" offset="13242639">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.445" offset="13254968">Let me begin by thanking my opposing counsel from respondents for answering the question I was unable to answer from Justice Ginsburg before with respect to the citation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.723" offset="13308154">That is the case that I had in mind as the leading authority in Nevada on the limitations on the award of punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.367" offset="13334694">Let me move on to the areas where I'm not so grateful for his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.142" offset="13357786">Let me begin first with the standing question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.366" offset="13374714">We heard a lot about standing this morning in the prior issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.025" offset="13389342">Surely there is no question before this Court that Humana has standing to contest the applicability of RICO to it, and surely there is no question that this Court will not be announcing a rule of law that determines whether a Federal statute applies or not by looking at the financial condition of the defendant against whom the Federal law is urged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.003" offset="13489234">We have conceded that insolvency is not an issue in this case, but that is not an answer to the jurisprudential problem of whether the States are entitled to have Federal deference under the McCarran Ferguson Act to decisions which are related to that consideration in the general context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.507" offset="13579305">And let me move, then, to the question of impair, and whether a State statute that does not contemplate multiple damages, as the Nevada statute does not, is in fact impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.670" offset="13647954">Several justices put to the Government and to the respondents a hypothetical circumstance that I posed this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.505" offset="13679301">Suppose the preamble of the statute specifically recognized the State interest in preserving the solvency of the insurance company and the potential impediment to that State purpose, that treble damages, mandatory treble damages provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.746" offset="13752235">The respondents conceded that if that preamble existed, RICO would impair Nevada law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.600" offset="13779612">The Government did not make such a concession, but I suggest that the Government's response was not entirely satisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.665" offset="13807928">The issue before this Court I believe boils down to the question of whether, under McCarran Ferguson, the States must adopt such preambles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.263" offset="13854322">Is... are the Federal courts to look beyond what the State statute says and second guess the policymaking decision of the State legislature to say that the State legislature didn't really mean it when it only allowed for compensatory damages under the State insurance law?</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.687" offset="13940003">The counsel for respondents concluded his argument with a reference to Judge Learned Hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.993" offset="13969261">Let me conclude mine with a reference to Judge Magruder of the First Circuit in one of the follow up cases to Erie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.889" offset="14004787">And I am going to do this by memory, so I may not get it entirely correct, but if the Federal courts can sit in judgment of the State legislatures and decide whether particular legislative enactments are or are not important, then the ghost of Swift v. Tison still walks the land, greatly reduced in size but still capable of much mischief.</text>
