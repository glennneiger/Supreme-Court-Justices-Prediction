State reversed based on that court's determination that a requirement under Florida law and under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution mandates that there be a neutral magistrate sought and a warrant obtained prior to the seizure of a vehicle under the Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.309" offset="914566">The reason the State started out with the Cooper decision is it's believed that that in that case there, the subject matter of scrutiny was the search following the seizure, and the seizure at that point was... was under a forfeiture statute and was not in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.458" offset="975066">It seems reasoned and followed that if in this instance where the inventory search is not in question in this instance, that both the seizure and the search are satisfied... satisfies the Fourth Amendment with regard to practices engaged in by the Florida authorities.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="238.847" offset="1040685">--what troubles me about the case is the long time interval between the... between the time when the... the police had probable cause to believe that the vehicle had been used for a crime and the time when they elected to... to seize it as forfeit.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.801" offset="1116440">I... it just raises the possibility of... of the police creating a... a sort of a evidence depository by simply identifying a car and just leaving that car out there for years and years until they... until they finally determine that it... it has evidence that they'd like to have, whereupon they... they move in and seize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.214" offset="1206093">What... what assurance is there?</text>

            <text syncTime="284.469" offset="1223124">Well, first of all, in this instance, all of the activities that occurred that generated the need or the ability by the State to forfeit occurred prior to any activity going on with regard to this... this last event.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.376" offset="1274742">It wasn't that the car was suddenly sitting out there doing nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="320.182" offset="1365962">If you say they seize it right away, I don't see a potential for abuse, but if you say once they see it being used for a drug transaction, they can thereafter just put in their file, you know, license number, whatever, can be seized at any time, and then wait until they think there may be some evidence in that car.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.484" offset="1435239">And the real reason they're seizing it thereafter, or at least the real reason for their timing, is to obtain the evidence and not to... and not to forfeit the car.</text>

            <text syncTime="1153.172" offset="4697933">However, I think it's generally understood that there may be countervailing concerns that would justify some form of delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.416" offset="4722906">The police might want to see whether this person was acting in confederation with others, might want to see whether it could locate bigger operatives within the criminal organization.</text>

            <text syncTime="1371.305" offset="5570527">It doesn't, though, I think follow as... as you suggested a second later that that makes the warrant requirement irrelevant because it seems to me that if there is a warrant requirement, we're going to have some magistrate considering at the time the warrant is issued, i.e., prior to the actual seizure, whether in fact the delay has dissipated the reasonableness of the search on... on the... on the theory on... on which forfeitures are... are required.</text>

            <text syncTime="2509.626" offset="10123774">The first reason was that it would place these people on notice that the owners or possessors, in that case the possessors, of the vessel... it would place them on notice, and that they then might abscond with the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.324" offset="10170586">The second thing you were concerned about in Calero-Toledo was that if you gave them an adversarial hearing, which we're not asking for here... that if you gave them an adversarial hearing, the delay occasioned by that would allow them to continue to use the vessel for illicit purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.512" offset="10227324">And the third thing you noted in Calero-Toledo was... or the third reason for which you decided Calero-Toledo was that the disinterested government was the seizing agency and not some interested private... private agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="2552.933" offset="10297018">An adversarial hearing might put the person in the car that allegedly has carried illicit contraband on notice, and might give him a reason to flea, but an ex parte judicial warrant won't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.271" offset="10342367">Secondly, there is certainly no evidence in this case that the government was concerned about continued use of the car for illicit purposes.</text>

            <label>Ms. Carolyn M. Snurkowski</label>
            <text syncTime="3129.234" offset="12602168">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.992" offset="12605302">Forfeiture is a process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.875" offset="12612826">It's not just the activity of seizing the car, and the Florida statute is very clear with regard to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.628" offset="12639784">The seizure of the vehicle commences forfeiture proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.572" offset="12651591">It is not the end all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.732" offset="12656189">So, to suggest that somehow the police are acting beyond the pale and doing something that they shouldn't do because there's going to be monies coming to the agency at some point I believe is not a sound basis to suggest that forfeiture is not a valid basis upon which to be able to seize without a... a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.415" offset="12730899">Watson I believe is very controlling with regard to this instance whether a individual, who has committed a felony and there's probable cause by the police officers to arrest or, in fact, he sees the individual committing a misdemeanor in his presence, I don't believe that there's a dime's worth of difference, to be very frank, between that and the bottom line of seizing a vehicle where the officers understand, believe, and have knowledge and probable cause based on that knowledge, that this vehicle is an instrumentality in a criminal endeavor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.265" offset="12858377">In this particular instance, the police did not just willy-nilly go down to the Sam's parking lot and seize the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.731" offset="12892231">They had an arrest warrant and they arrested Mr. White on other charges, on other narcotics charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.646" offset="12919817">And as a part of that, they seized the vehicle because they had the requisite probable cause based on earlier conduct by this defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.960" offset="12953149">The State would submit that there's nothing been done during this event, nor any other event, that similarly tracks the ability of the government to go and seize vehicles without a pre-seizure warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.183" offset="13025978">In fact, that is done throughout this country on a daily basis based on the Federal forfeiture acts and other State forfeiture acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.677" offset="13055967">And, in fact, many States and many... in particular, other supreme courts and the Federal Government have relied heavily with regard to the applicability of the Cooper decision, of the applicability of Watson, and of G.M.--</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.227" offset="13110197">And with regard to our G.M. argument, the reason... one of the reasons why I believe that we did not rely so heavily on that was the second prong of this, was that we want to make sure that the... the Court understood that we're not talking about real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.695" offset="13164114">There was a discussion with regard to the Florida Supreme Court about Florida Department of Law Enforcement versus real property in their opinion, and that case dealt with real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.631" offset="13199849">We are talking about personal property such as vehicles and other instrumentalities of criminal act, not real property which is an exception under the Florida statutes with regard to forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.338" offset="13238615">Thank you.</text>
