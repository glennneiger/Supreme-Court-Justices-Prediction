            <text syncTime="12.070" offset="226150">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.912" offset="237435">Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution requires that representatives be apportioned based on the number of persons in each State.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.409" offset="275469">And to effectuate that requirement, Congress is directed to provide for, quote, the actual enumeration, to occur every 10 years, in such manner as Congress shall by law direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.178" offset="326565">In modern times, as the census has faced increasing challenges, Congress has delegated authority to the Secretary of Commerce to conduct a census in such form and content as he may determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.425" offset="379541">Following exhaustive study and the unanimous recommendation of the Census Bureau, the National Academy of Sciences, and other professional groups, the Secretary has determined that for the 2000 census, employing statistical sampling, in addition to other means of enumeration, will best achieve the constitutional goal of determining the number of persons in each State.</text>

            <text syncTime="81.466" offset="503675">And I want to ask you about the first one... rather the second one... which I... I gather is a series of 750,000 housing units, selected randomly.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.416" offset="555502">And they will then be used to adjust the figures from census tracts?</text>

            <text syncTime="100.418" offset="579535">--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.789" offset="588939">If... just a small correction in the premise of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.881" offset="601373">There are three methods of sampling that the Census Bureau proposes to conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.315" offset="619136">One is not challenged by... at least directly... by any of the plaintiffs in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.560" offset="644109">But the third one, the integrated cover ment measurement portion of the survey, is actually quite similar in... in the means by which it will done... is going to be done... as in 1990, the post enumeration survey that the Court discussed in Wisconsin v. City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.811" offset="721118">That is, after the first two phases of the census are completed and there is an initial enumeration roster with respect to every census block and tract, the--</text>

            <text syncTime="156.955" offset="805651">There are... there are three phases, Mr. Chief Justice, to the 2000 Census.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.989" offset="821742">The first phase will be a... a series of mailings to every individual household, an 800 number for people who don't want to respond by mail to call in their answers, the distribution of questionnaires in malls and public libraries and other places.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.851" offset="893213">That's the first phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.343" offset="899169">The second phase involves what's called non response follow up.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.436" offset="919545">And that includes both an effort to physically visit a certain number... up to 90 percent of the houses in each census tract, and the use of statistical sampling to impute the population characteristics with respect to those homes which did not send in... mail in their census information and were not located personally.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="213.615" offset="1032289">But when you say up to 90 percent, there... there is going to be an intentional effort not to do 100 percent?</text>

            <text syncTime="219.029" offset="1053918">No, there... Justice Scalia, there is an intentional effort in this census to obtain census information from every household that is known to exist by mailings, by a Be Counted program, by telephone, by the Internet.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.268" offset="1110865">The Census Bureau has determined that in order to make the population totals for apportionment purposes more accurate, it will not have enumerators physically go to every single house that did not respond to those initial requests for information, but rather will go to enough houses so that 90 percent of every household in each census tract has been the subject of a, quote, physical count.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.628" offset="1232387">And it will then use statistical sampling on a completely random basis... and I think this is key, because none of the plaintiffs have alleged, nor could they, that they have been injured in any way by the effort... by the attempt to use sampling--</text>

            <text syncTime="282.188" offset="1306575">The... once the initial enumeration roster is completed by means of the mail in, the non response follow up, which is both physical and sampling, the national vacancy check, which uses sampling to impute population, there will be what's called an initial enumeration roster.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.522" offset="1383897">The Bureau will then conduct, much as it did in 1990, but on a much larger, more sophisticated scale, using a completely separate cadre of individuals, it will, on 25,000 blocks of the country, selected in advance according to methodologies that have been specified, survey intensively every single one of those households to determine the extent to which the people show up the second time that weren't identified the first time or were identified the first time and weren't identified the second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.167" offset="1530496">And any discrepancy in information that any person gives will be the subject of a follow up visit.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.690" offset="1556619">The results of that procedure, the inter... integrated coverage measurement, it is in effect a quality check on the initial enumeration roster.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.027" offset="1601967">And using the system of dual system estimation that the Court described better in Wisconsin v. City of New York than I could standing here, it will adjust the results of the initial enumeration roster to more accurately reflect the total number of persons in each State, district--</text>

            <text syncTime="2189.158" offset="8934434">Everybody thought that sampling in the apportionment census... at least sampling in lieu of an effort to reach everybody... was prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.343" offset="8967244">What we submit to the Court is that it was not that clause... sampling was prohibited before 195 was enacted because... for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.541" offset="9007995">There was a provision, Section... old Section 25(c) of the Census Act... that required that an enumerator visit every house and record the number of persons present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.277" offset="9050940">And a sample in lieu of that would have been impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.161" offset="9066509">There was also a... a determin... I don't know about a determination... but both the Congress, in '57, and the Bureau, in '57, indicated that a sample census or a sample survey would not be consistent with the statutory term "census".</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.880" offset="9133383">And in 1976... well 25(c) was repealed in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.425" offset="9159505">And with respect to the implicit meaning of the word 1976, Congress said in the most direct way it could that the census should be conducted in such form and content as the Secretary may determine, including the use of sampling procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.477" offset="9231708">Now, the reading that the other side wants to give this would... that is, that Section 195 prohibits sampling for apportionment purposes and requires it where feasible for all other purposes, deprives that amendment of Section 141(a) of any meaning at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.539" offset="9304015">There's nothing left for those words to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.399" offset="9311434">And what's most significant to us is that by the time Congress enacted this amendment in 1976, the Census Bureau had been using imputation techniques... in 1940, in 1950, in 1960, in 1970, and in 1970... and this was known... this was published by the Census Bureau and the subject of discussions in mentions in House reports and in hearings... the Census Bureau had used statistical sampling in two different respects in the 1970 Census to correct the State population totals by one and a half million people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.317" offset="9471094">There was a sampling used in the national vacancy check and sampling used in something... in the Southern States... in something called Peapock.</text>

            <text syncTime="2342.429" offset="9547580">Then 143 says take a census of agriculture.</text>

            <text syncTime="2429.056" offset="9894069">I'd like to turn first to the issue of justiciability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.448" offset="9907652">Congress passed the '98 Appropriations Act to authorize this litigation to proceed in this Court before the census was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.734" offset="9940776">Because it found it was absolutely critical to protect the concrete interests of the House of Representatives and also to authorize private parties, who may be injured as well, to bring this controversy to the Court so it could be resolved in time to provide meaningful relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.184" offset="10002529">The House does not expect this Court to find that it has standing to resolve the issue of standing if the private parties have... have established standing and if that judgment is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.060" offset="10042026">It would be perfectly appropriate, and we would agree that the Court should simply not reach the issue of the House's standing in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.915" offset="10073478">But if for any reason this Court finds that the private parties do not have standing, it should find that the House does; that the district court properly determined that in these rare and unusual circumstances that Congress acted well within its constitutional authority to provide a cause of action for the House to come to court to resolve this... this legal issue, this legal dispute which has created an impasse between the branches, and to provide relief so that the House will receive the information that it has requested and needs to perform its legislative functions and so that its own composition will not be unconstitutionally and unlawfully altered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.371" offset="10227287">These are concrete interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.431" offset="10235541">These are interests which are cognizable.</text>

I guess to the objection that if this is a sufficient basis for standing here, the Congress, as a practical matter, can place any obligation on some agency of the executive branch to provide it with information on a concrete subject; and if it ends up not liking the... the information that it gets, in effect, can sue the executive branch on matters that certainly impinge on the respective policy responsibilities of the two branches?</text>

            <text syncTime="2559.571" offset="10416100">I don't think so, Your Honor, for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.403" offset="10423414">First of all, there has to be a substantial nexus between the challenge to the executive branch conduct and the request for information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.178" offset="10454552">And that of course is satisfied here because, since the beginning of our history, Congress has always relied upon the executive branch to provide it with a report of the population numbers, determined in accordance with the constitutional requirement for an actual enumeration, and the Census Act requirements that it be based on an actual count.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.720" offset="10536681">And so I... I think that that nexus is clearly satisfied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.515" offset="10555907">Second, I think this Court could, and should, find that the only kinds of actions that should be challenged... subject to challenge... would be those executive branch actions which have traditionally been subject to challenge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3655.813" offset="14801118">Of course, the decennial census covers, it's not so much funding and that sort of thing, it's the myriad of information that has to be collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.999" offset="14829853">The decennial census is the census of population and housing and matters pertaining to population and housing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3689.216" offset="14934656">Certainly to determine the population for the mid decade census.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.519" offset="14947927">195 would allow the Secretary to do that, but I don't think that the Census Act could readily be read to support the view that the Secretary is required to go out and conduct an actual enumeration of everyone in the United States by household under the decennial census and then go back and do it over using sampling for other purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.872" offset="15037265">I think that the distinction is between the determination of the population in the decennial and the gathering of all the other information, and that that is the best reading of the act, but that is not... it is not actually squarely presented by our case, because we are here challenging the methods that are being used to determine the size of the State delegations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3970.871" offset="16061265">For standing purposes, my point is that you can't have an apportionment if you accept our allegations as true in 2001, because you won't have the 100 percent apportionment number.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.179" offset="16110585">So this is no different than the Census Bureau saying tomorrow we'll enumerate 50 percent of the houses, or not conduct any census at all, and that hurts two kinds of people.</text>

            <text syncTime="4750.252" offset="19178823">They say that there's a statute which says, except for population... except for apportionment purposes the Secretary shall if feasible use sampling, and then they say, a few paragraphs earlier it does say that the Secretary shall take a population census in any form he wants, including sampling, and unless that thing I last said was meant to allow him to do what you don't like, it would be meaningless.</text>

            <text syncTime="4775.767" offset="19280909">Well, but as you pointed out earlier Justice Breyer, all 141 does is authorize sampling as specified in the subsequent statutory provisions that deal directly with sampling.</text>
            <text syncTime="4786.426" offset="19323541">The Solicitor General argues that the word sampling in 141 is therefore somewhat redundant, but the presumption against redundancy has been incredibly rebutted in this statute, because the Solicitor General simultaneously concedes that the Solicitor General's authority for nonapportionment sampling under 141 is controlled by section 195, that you need to read section 195 into 141 for nonapportionment sampling.</text>
            <text syncTime="4811.762" offset="19424896">Also, of course, it's inherent in the statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="4814.564" offset="19436077">They use the word sampling four times.</text>
            <text syncTime="4817.385" offset="19447362">Every time they gave the Secretary authority in 1976 they threw in, including sampling.</text>
            <text syncTime="4823.158" offset="19470454">Now, we know that wasn't intended to mean anything, because in 14(d), which deals strictly with mid decade apportionment and therefore deals... mid decade census, and therefore has nothing to do with apportionment sampling, it deals strictly with nonapportionment sampling, they have the same language, and they say the Secretary can do nonapportionment sampling.</text>
            <text syncTime="4843.743" offset="19552792">That is entirely meaningless, because everyone agrees that under section 195 the Secretary already had authority to do nonapportionment sampling, so the reference to sampling in the mid decade sentencing provision was entirely meaningless, showing conclusively that Congress didn't intend for this language to have any substantial import.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.405" offset="19635443">My final point is, even if the grant to the Secretary is ambiguous, the defendant's plan is still unlawful, because clearly, if you are making a major change in policy after 190 years, this Court has ruled in seven different cases cited throughout our briefs that that change in policy needs to be done through a plain statement rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="4952.155" offset="19986425">What is contested is that one or two or three of those six States might lose a Congressman, but as again, under Lujan, we need not show that if they gave us 100 percent actual enumeration number, we will definitely benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4966.724" offset="20044730">We need only show that it might benefit us realistically, just like an environmental impact statement might realistically benefit you.</text>
            <text syncTime="4974.268" offset="20074927">You need not be caught in a catch 22, where you challenge the Government's refusal to provide information, and the standing requirement is, you must show that the information will definitely benefit you, if the reason you don't have the information is because the Government has unlawfully refused to provide you with that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="4993.451" offset="20151623">So under any theory of standing, we have it both on an interstate basis, and on an intrastate basis, and as the Chief Justice pointed out earlier, this Court will be in no better position to resolve this factual question in 2001, because in 2001, as today, there will not be a 100-percent actual enumeration number.</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.905" offset="20233438">So if you insist the plaintiffs show you that we will have 10 Congressmen under the 100-percent head count number and we will only have 9 under the defendant's sampling plan, no plaintiff will ever be able to make that showing, because there will never be a 100-percent actual enumeration number, since they have decided to stop at 90 percent in counting people, and they have decided to statistically estimate the rest of those people up to 100 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5040.953" offset="20341585">And to return very briefly to the Constitution, if actual enumeration is a process, then clearly, the only process it contemplates is counting.</text>

            <text syncTime="5129.032" offset="20693925">Now, the plaintiffs in the case have made much of the fact that there is little legislative history to support the notion that Congress in 1976 affirmatively wanted to permit sampling, but the legislative history on their side both on 1976 and in 1957 is deafening.</text>
            <text syncTime="5154.077" offset="20794131">There were hearings all the time in the 1970's about what the Census Bureau was doing, and the undercount, and talked about what they had done.</text>
            <text syncTime="5162.432" offset="20827567">The Census Bureau had published reports about what it had done in 1970 to use sampling to correct for the undercount.</text>
            <text syncTime="5169.278" offset="20854944">In 1976 they had a hearing about using dual system estimation to correct the 1980 undercounts, and there is not one word in the reports that accompanied the 1976 amendments or any of the debates that suggested that anybody thought there was anything wrong with using statistical sampling to increase the accuracy of the effort to count to get information from every person.</text>

            <text syncTime="5197.675" offset="20968524">Now, but you're not using it to increase the accuracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5201.198" offset="20982630">I mean, you can say that if you do a 100-percent head count and then use statistics to try to get the people you didn't get in the 100-percent head count.</text>
            <text syncTime="5209.353" offset="21015231">But as described, and I think it's an accurate description, you don't do 100 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5212.224" offset="21026725">You don't even try to do 100 percent head count.</text>
            <text syncTime="5214.247" offset="21034771">You just count 90 percent.</text>

            <text syncTime="5216.019" offset="21041876">--Justice Scalia, the Census Bureau and the National Academy of Science panels and the GAO all agree that the Bureau's method for conducting the nonresponse follow up, which uses some statistical sampling, will be at least as accurate as if they had done physical nonresponse follow up, and it will increase the overall accuracy of the census because it will be conducted in 5 weeks rather than 14 weeks and permit the ICM part of the process to be conducted with more... better trained people, and at a time that is closer to Census Day.</text>
