            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="6.202">First case I have to announce is Hunt versus Cromartie, number 98-85.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.207">This case comes to us on appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.269">In Shaw versus Hunt, we held that the North Carolina’s District 12, was a product of an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.474">In response to our decision, the State enacted a new districting plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.389">Appellees, however believed that the (Inaudible) also was unconstitutionally informed and brought suit against several state officials seeking to enjoin elections from being held pursuant to this new plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.017">Before discovery and without an evidentiary hearing, the District Court granted summary judgment in appellee's favor and entered in an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.870">In the District Court’s view, the uncontroverted material facts showed that the State used racial criteria in drawing District 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.487">In our opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.095">Districting legislation ordinarily, is race neutral on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.057">It classifies tracts of land, precincts or census blocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.031">The task of assessing a jurisdiction’s motive therefore is an inherently complex endeavor.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.405">One requiring careful inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence as may be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.020">Appellees presented evidence showing District 12, size, shape and alleged lack of continuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.130">They also presented statistical and demographic evidence reporting to show that at several points along District 12’s boundary, heavily black districts were included within District 12, while precincts that were equally democratic in terms of voter registration were excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.293">On the whole and viewed in light of our prior cases appellee's evidence tends to support an inference that the State drew its district lines with an impressible racial motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.262">But summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue of material fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.729">The State’s motivation is a factual question and was sufficiently put in dispute by appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.746">Appellants argue that the State’s districting plan was drawn with the intent to make District 12, a strong democratic district.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.949">They supported their contention with affidavits from two state legislatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.194">More important they offered affidavit testimony from an expert witness, who analyze voting results in addition to party registration figures and who examined District 12’s entire border as oppose to select points along that border.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.625">In the expert’s view the underlying data supported a political motivation at least as well as and somewhat better than a racial explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.920">Accepting appellants political motivation explanation as true as is required at the summary judgment stage, the fact of the legislature’s motivation was in dispute and appellees were not entitled to judgment as matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.499">A jurisdiction may engage in constitutional political gerrymandering, even if it so happens that the most loyal democrats are black democrats, and even if the State’s legislature was conscious of that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.145">We do not hold that summary judgment may be never be held in the plaintiff’s favor in a racial gerrymandering case like this one, sought to be proved exclusively by circumstantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.604">We can’t imagine an instance where the reasonable inference is to be drawn in the non moving party’s favor would not be significantly probative so as to create a genuine issue of material fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.936">But appellant’s evidence is not of that character.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.459">We also do not express position on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.476">The District Court is more familiar with the evidence than we are, and it may turn out, that the appellees prove their claim to the state acted with an impermissible motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.786">Summary judgment however is inappropriate when the evidence is susceptible of different interpretations or inferences by the prior fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.266">Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment which Justices Souter, Ginsberg and Breyer have joined.</text>
