            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="151049">We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 97-1121, the City of Chicago v. Jesus Morales.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.417" offset="188665">Mr. Rosenthal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence Rosenthal</label>
            <text syncTime="10.619" offset="193472">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="19.746" offset="229939">As the record before the Chicago City Council makes plain, gang crime is different from most other forms of criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.841" offset="262331">Most criminals, of course, do not commit their crimes in broad daylight, in full view of law abiding citizens, and on the public way.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.277" offset="296081">Not so with gang crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.189" offset="307784">Street gangs rely on their ability to so terrorize their neighborhoods that they may commit crimes with impunity while law abiding persons are afraid to cooperate with the police, indeed, afraid to even use the public spaces in their own neighborhoods.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.699" offset="361805">When police are present, however, all they see is gang members pretending to innocently loiter.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.313" offset="384270">On that record, the city council enacted the gang loitering ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.156" offset="403601">It provides that whenever a police officer sees a group of loiterers in a public place and reasonably believes a member of a criminal street gang to be present, he may order the group to disperse.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.194" offset="447800">This morning, I will discuss the two holdings below and explain why this ordinance is neither impermissibly vague nor inconsistent with principles of substantive due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="85.151" offset="491581">Do the police have special training and instructions to know who members of the gangs are?</text>

            <text syncTime="89.014" offset="507046">The general order that govern enforcement, 92 4... it is in the petition appendix... contains quite explicit instructions and demanding standards for making determinations of gang membership and, of course, even respondents do not challenge--</text>

            <text syncTime="106.244" offset="576009">For example, under the order, not all police officers are permitted to enforce this ordinance, only gang specialists, tactical officers, and other specially designated personnel familiar with the gang files of the Chicago Police Department are permitted to make arrests under the ordinance.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="121.364" offset="636404">Well then, how does the person who's not a member of the gang know that he is doing something unlawful?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence Rosenthal</label>
            <text syncTime="126.978" offset="658869">Well, interestingly, Justice Kennedy, the critical point here is that, on the question of fair notice, as Your Honor's question points out, it is not unlawful to loiter in the City of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.036" offset="707144">When one loiters with a gang member one is not breaking the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.329" offset="720309">Under this ordinance, it is a crime only, after having received an order to disperse, to fail to obey that order, order--</text>

            <text syncTime="170.568" offset="833263">That provides fair notice of what the constitution requires, how to conform one's conduct with the requirement of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3246.642" offset="13137563">United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois estimates there are 100,000 gang members in the City of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.772" offset="13182076">Mr. Grossman says we must use laws that require individualized determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.553" offset="13201198">Well, it was the failure of those laws to satisfactorily address the problem that led to the enactment of this ordinance and, indeed, gang crime has been rising since the ordinance was no longer in effect in '97.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.331" offset="13248322">More people got shot as a result of gang related shootings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.473" offset="13260861">The fatality rate went down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.045" offset="13267131">More people have gotten shot again this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.107" offset="13275385">In fact, drive bys are up 40 percent this year in the City of Chicago without this ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.959" offset="13290850">What does that tell us?</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.712" offset="13297851">Well, on the vagueness prong... there are two prongs, of course, to vagueness inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.904" offset="13318644">Fair notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.545" offset="13321152">Mr. Grossman doesn't really address that, because no criminal sanctions are available under this ordinance for loitering alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.830" offset="13346334">Criminal sanctions come into play only after an officer specifically informs an individual that he has loitered in that officer's... the officer's determined he's loitered with a gang member in a public place and is subject to an order to disperse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.459" offset="13400878">Mr. Grossman therefore focuses on the second prong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.353" offset="13412371">The second prong the Court describes as minimal standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.973" offset="13426896">There is not some manual for how to write statutes lurking in the Due Process Clause and here, whatever the imprecisions in loitering, even if this ordinance can be potentially applied to all people standing still, remaining in any one place, in the City of Chicago there remains an enforcement standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.255" offset="13491993">There must be a reasonable belief that a member of a criminal street gang is present and that has dangers associated with it, as the legislature found, not only dangers to the gang member, dangers to the innocent bystanders that are nearby.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.683" offset="13541730">When innocent bystanders are ordered to move on, it is not because they've done anything wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="3380.445" offset="13672760">It is far more effective to issue these dispersal orders generally and, of course narrow tailoring is not required in rational basis analysis under the substantive Due Process Clause.</text>
