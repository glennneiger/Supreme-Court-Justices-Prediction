            <text syncTime="167.185" offset="816028">For example, in Camenisch, which is the case relied on primarily by the respondents, the claim was that the student was entitled to an interpreter under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.035" offset="863362">The injunction was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.615" offset="869735">The case came to this Court before the case had been decided on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.110" offset="887708">But let's assume that the case had come to this Court after the case had been decided on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.232" offset="916129">Clearly if the... if the injunction had been vacated, the State would have had a remedy, namely, the remedy of recouping the amount of money it had paid for the interpreter.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.869" offset="954686">That is not so here because there is no claim in this case that the permanent injunction was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.164" offset="979868">There is no claim in this case that the plaintiffs did not have a probability of success on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.228" offset="1004109">The claim in this case is as to the power of the court to issue the preliminary injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1911.321" offset="7792498">GMD initially filed such a petition for... or motion for modification and withdrew it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.145" offset="7815799">So, I think that one of the things that's presented here is the highly hypothetical nature of the claim on... on the bond.</text>

            <text syncTime="1940.731" offset="7910153">Let me turn, if I may, to the Erie question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.903" offset="7922901">As we've indicated in our brief, we think that the Erie issue is not properly before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.976" offset="7947143">It was not fairly included in the question presented, nor was it pressed or passed on in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.360" offset="7972638">I think the colloquy between the Court and Mr. Mescon reflect the fact that what GMD is asking this Court to do is the work of the lower court judges, that is, the trial judge and the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.420" offset="8020913">Now, they have pointed to a decision by the Second Circuit in this case in which the court says all parties agree that this type of relief would not be available under rule 64 or New York injunction law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.529" offset="8085383">First of all, that entire discussion in the lower courts was about the relationship between rule 64 and 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.177" offset="8119969">Erie never came up, and I think one would search in vain to find even the word Erie mentioned in any of the filings in this court below until this Court got the merits brief from GMD in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.865" offset="8182663">And secondly... and I know it's somewhat curious that the court says rule 64 and the injunction statute, but what it was saying was that under New York law, if one brings an attachment action pursuant to rule 64, one can also get an injunction in aid of that attachment process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.829" offset="8258522">So, I think that it is unfair to look at that decision as a pronouncement on what New York law would, in fact, hold if those courts had been invited to consider Erie and go through the process that you were discussing with Mr. Mescon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.549" offset="8317455">Let me turn to the basic issue here, though.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.132" offset="8331770">I think Mr. Mescon has been very direct and very candid in saying that there's no historical or statutory predicate for what the district judge did here, and indeed, that this court has no power to authorize a Federal judge to do what Judge Martin did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.404" offset="8412854">I am reminded of a quotation from Justice Holmes in which he said that it is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that's what was laid down in the time of Henry IV.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.062" offset="8467502">It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.847" offset="8502611">Now, I don't necessarily want to embrace the revolting part of that statement by Mr. Justice Holmes, but I think it does get to the heart of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.144" offset="8539809">What basically GMD is saying is that there were cases in the 19th century where parties sought to get freeze orders and were told that they were unable to do that, that the court simply could not provide that type of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.537" offset="8605429">Scott v. Neely, the Hollins case, and there are other cases that go to the same point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.500" offset="8625282">But those were pre-merger cases, and I think that if one thinks about them in terms of their being pre-merger, when courts were faced first, as was true in those cases, with a request for a final judgment that included the freeze order, that is, a freeze order that would take the defendants property and convert it in a way that would satisfy a money judgment that the plaintiffs were seeking--</text>

            <text syncTime="3395.215" offset="13728145">On the question of whether Mareva injunctions are a good idea or a bad idea, there's been a lot written.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.030" offset="13755313">It's referred to in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.060" offset="13759492">The question of how it would implicate our bankruptcy statutes, the question of how it would implicate the relationships between debtors and creditors, the question of how it would implicate our relations with other nations are all important, interesting questions that suggest that Mareva injunctions would not be a good idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.403" offset="13836815">But in any event, whether they are or whether they are not, it is for the Congress to decide whether or not that is an appropriate extension of the judicial power in the United States because the lower Federal courts in this country--</text>

            <text syncTime="3441.685" offset="13914033">Second, the complaint in this case did not request any kind of establishment of a trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.872" offset="13958754">There was a motion made, a preliminary injunction motion, that called for the creation of a trust, but that was not part of the permanent relief.</text>
