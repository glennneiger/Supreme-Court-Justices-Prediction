            <label>Mr. William J. Kayatta, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="47.721" offset="332378">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="52.145" offset="350142">This is an action for plan benefits under ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.859" offset="368950">Now, the plan in question in this case is an insurance policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.002" offset="389534">It is not a self-funded plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.654" offset="396117">Citing this fact, the Ninth Circuit has determined that certain claim administration rules in this ERISA plan cannot be enforced in this Federal action because California courts would not enforce those same claim administration rules under common law principles that are regularly applied by California courts in breach of insurance contract cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.475" offset="515444">There are two basic flaws to this holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.318" offset="530804">First, the Ninth Circuit has disregarded Congress' intent to create uniform exclusively Federal rules for claims administration and enforcement without reference to varying State laws, even State laws that regulate insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.060" offset="609799">Second and independently, the Ninth Circuit has misapplied ERISA's statutory preemption clause by determining that California's notice prejudice rule is a rule that regulated insurance and by determining that a rule of California common law that precludes a plan administrator from doing what Congress says the administrator can do does not relate to an employee benefit plan.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="149.002" offset="737485">Well, you do agree that, even under ERISA, a State law that satisfies McCarran-Ferguson Act requirements is not preempted?</text>
            <text syncTime="159.788" offset="780640">There is a savings clause?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_kayatta_jr" startTime="161.659" stopTime="204.280">
            <label>Mr. William J. Kayatta, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="161.659" offset="788163">We agree there is a savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.541" offset="795686">We do not agree that any law that satisfies McCarran-Ferguson is automatically saved.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.746" offset="820555">You could have a law that satisfies the definition of business of insurance that this Court could determine is not a law which regulates insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.614" offset="867993">Secondly and more importantly, this Court has held in Pilot Life, reaffirmed it in Taylor, and then again in John Hancock, that even laws that are otherwise saved under the savings clause are preempted if they stand as an obstacle to one of Congress' purposes in enacting ERISA or in a specific provision.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="204.280" offset="958690">Not just the broad general purpose of ERISA, because if you did that wouldn't you have to call every one of them in favor of the beneficiary, because the purpose of ERISA was to protect people's insurance, workers' insurance, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="223.221" offset="1034445">Isn't that the... I mean, ERISA wasn't passed to make life easy for insurers.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_kayatta_jr" startTime="229.575" stopTime="261.588">
            <label>Mr. William J. Kayatta, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="229.575" offset="1059836">ERISA made a number of balances.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.006" offset="1069554">One of its primary purposes was to make employers more likely to have these plans to benefit workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.663" offset="1100169">That is the major benefit that ERISA produces for employees, and it has been fabulously successful, in large part because of what this Court did in Pilot Life.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.669" offset="1136218">Now, having said that, I agree with you that an amorphous purpose of ERISA without some clear foundation in the record is not enough to preempt a law that would otherwise be saved.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="261.588" stopTime="288.346">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="261.588" offset="1187836">Well, what does the savings clause save?</text>
            <text syncTime="266.001" offset="1205495">One argument that you made that I thought certainly would require modification is that if you have a policy term and it's something written into the policy, that wipes away the savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.701" offset="1268293">And that can't be right.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.742" offset="1272473">It's not given to private ordering to do away with the savings clause.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_kayatta_jr" startTime="288.346" stopTime="355.965">
            <label>Mr. William J. Kayatta, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="288.346" offset="1294938">We agree with that, Your Honor, and we're not saying that you can do away with the savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.149" offset="1310089">The savings clause... we also agree that the analysis starts with the presumption that State law is saved.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.616" offset="1348019">However, the second stage of the analysis then says, is this within the savings clause?</text>
            <text syncTime="307.121" offset="1369962">And the third stage, and this is the stage we're talking about now, says even if it is within the savings clause it will not stand, it will be preempted, in certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.658" offset="1416147">And the most important circumstance is the one identified by this Court in Pilot Life and reaffirmed in Taylor and Hancock, which is when you go to the heart of ERISA's... Congress did not do many things in ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.108" offset="1469959">It left the substantive benefits of plans, particularly welfare plans, totally alone and silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.242" offset="1494514">But what it directed its attention to was erecting a comprehensive, uniform Federal civil enforcement scheme modeled after section 301 of the LMRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.159" offset="1542161">And you cannot... this Court has held that that purpose is not to be frustrated.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="355.965" stopTime="387.099">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="355.965" offset="1565358">Why couldn't the Federal scheme adopt the same rule as California?</text>
            <text syncTime="364.924" offset="1601198">I mean, if this is a proposition of general contract law in California and other States, would xx objection to the Federal courts... I mean, let's s xx manded to the Ninth Circuit and they say: I guess you're right, we shouldn't have applied this provision of California law; but as it happens, Federal law's the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.627" offset="1684058">Would that be all right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_kayatta_jr" startTime="387.099" stopTime="392.323">
            <label>Mr. William J. Kayatta, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="387.099" offset="1689910">That would... that would eliminate one of the problems with what the Ninth Circuit has done.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="392.323" stopTime="392.623">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="392.323" offset="1710808">The one you just talked on.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_kayatta_jr" startTime="392.623" stopTime="478.903">
            <label>Mr. William J. Kayatta, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="392.623" offset="1712062">Yes, because now you would be doing what Congress said for the courts to do and what you told the courts to do, which is in a 502(a) action apply the statute and as necessary develop a uniform body of Federal common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.436" offset="1771307">So if you're now saying, okay, we're not going to have a Federal court's decision in an ERISA action as to how to interpret a plan mandated by a State common law, we're going to develop Federal common law, then the Court would confront several other questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.232" offset="1830449">One would be are we going to develop a common law that conflicts with any other substantive provisions of ERISA, and there are two in particular which the Court would need to pay attention to.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.700" offset="1872349">One is that which was identified by this Court as one of the core aspects of ERISA, which is the role that the written plan instrument plays under ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.728" offset="1916444">So the Federal court would need to say, before we go and say that the plan fiduciary must not, as Congress ordered him, act in accordance with a written plan instrument, we need to satisfy that there is some other Federal interest here that would overbear that, such as for example if you had a facial illegality of a policy that might be a circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.492" offset="1995542">The key point is, though, that the analysis would be one of Federal law and the Federal courts can look to State law, the Restatement states courts law around the country, to inform itself as to what the common law might be on a uniform Federal basis.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="478.903" stopTime="494.732">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="478.903" offset="2057191">May I interrupt just for one question.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.353" offset="2062938">I just don't know the answer because I don't have the Act clearly enough in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.747" offset="2080493">Was the term of the Act, the term that you just used, "written plan instrument", as distinct from something like, say, "terms of the plan", a more generic term?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_kayatta_jr" startTime="494.732" stopTime="506.591">
            <label>Mr. William J. Kayatta, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="494.732" offset="2120408">I do not believe the three words "written plan instrument" appear in a row.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.178" offset="2150292">However, what it says is "written plan document".</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="506.591" stopTime="541.494">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="506.591" offset="2167846">So it's referring to the words.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.764" offset="2180594">What I'm getting at is, and I think you've answered my... the question that was in the back of my mind... is would we have to say that the terms of the plan as ERISA used it might be the terms of the plan as modified by applicable State law?</text>
            <text syncTime="530.298" offset="2262723">I think your answer implicit in what you said is no, because ERISA is referring to the document and the document cannot possibly include an accommodation of State law, a modification of its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.553" offset="2303787">Is that fair?</text>

            <text syncTime="614.995" offset="2601479">Suppose that were the California law and California said, we are adopting this to regulate insurance, to regulate insurance sales in this state; insurer, you must give everybody two years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1947.576" offset="7931817">In this Court's decision in Metropolitan Life, the Court really went through a two-step analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.832" offset="7952819">The first and I think primary focus should be on whether the law is one regulating insurance within a commonsense or straightforward meaning of that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.458" offset="7983330">And in Metropolitan Life the Court held that a mandated benefits provision to be included in the contract of insurance regulates insurance within a commonsense understanding of that term, and specifically focused on the fact that "contract of insurance" is one of the phrases mentioned in the deemer clause and that that was the sort of thing intended to be saved to the States under the insurance savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.682" offset="8072251">The notice prejudice rule is directly parallel to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.375" offset="8086984">You could look at it either as a mandatory term in a contract, in effect, that untimeliness will not be a ground for rejecting the claim unless there is prejudice, or that it effectively renders unenforceable a provision in a contract that has a time limit unless prejudice is shown.</text>

            <text syncTime="2020.888" offset="8225120">But we do not believe that that is essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.690" offset="8232329">And even where the Pireno factors apply under the McCarran-Ferguson Act directly, the Court has said that no one factor is dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.024" offset="8265662">We don't think, particularly since the phrasing of the insurance savings clause seems to us to be broader... it talks about laws regulating insurance, not regulating the business of insurance... that those factors have to be applied literally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.630" offset="8308084">I think it's important to look at the Court's decision in FMC versus Holliday, where the Court held that a State law, anti-subrogation law, regulates insurance within the meaning of the insurance savings clause, and that certainly did not allocate the risk, the initial risk for the injury or the occurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.803" offset="8380705">What it did was simply say that if the insured recovers on a policy against the wrongdoer that there is no recovery from the insurance company on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.808" offset="8416754">So we think the commonsense view of it is that, at least if the issue concerns something that is in the contract of insurance... and this Court said in Metropolitan Life, referring to the National Securities case, that the relationship between the insured and the insurer, the contract of insurance and its enforcement, are at the very core of what Congress intended to save to the States under the insurance... excuse me, under McCarran-Ferguson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.626" offset="8516019">We think the contract of insurance and the relationship between the insured and the insurer is at the core here as well of what Congress intended to save to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.762" offset="8552591">There's no question that the notice prejudice rule goes to the relationship between the insured and the insurer and goes to the enforceability, one of the important things saved to the States, of the contract provision that is included within, either included within the contract or is rendered unenforceable in the absence of a showing of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.397" offset="8635138">I would like to... on the Elfstrom rule, the second point of the case, we do believe that the Elfstrom rule very clearly does relate to an ERISA plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2202.848" offset="8952891">I think the place to start is back with the savings clause in ERISA, where Congress said that any law of any State that regulates insurance would be saved from preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.304" offset="8990716">As I hear UNUM's argument, they are trying to define or add conditions to this by redefining the notice prejudice rule or the savings clause to exclude a rule that they characterize as administrative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.273" offset="9042648">But in our view the notice prejudice rule can't be accurately described as administrative, because it changes a condition precedent for coverage under the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.180" offset="9082249">The policy said that Mr. Ward had to make a claim within a particular period of time and if he didn't do so UNUM wouldn't have to pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="2268.372" offset="9215056">UNUM admits that the notice prejudice rule alters the terms of its policy, and in fact it's that alteration that forms the entire basis of its claim that there's a conflict with section 502.</text>

            <text syncTime="2328.816" offset="9456741">So even if the notice prejudice rule is seen as a rule that somehow only applies to the administration of the policy, I'm not sure that that suddenly automatically means that it's not within the scope of the savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.487" offset="9519435">I have a great difficulty, I think UNUM has great difficulty, or would have difficulty, in trying to square its argument with the Court's holding in FMC, where the Court said that the anti-subrogation law, which doesn't affect the coverage of the policy... the insurer still has to pay, but may be entitled after the fact to recover what it paid from the insurer... the insured, if the insured can recover it from a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.882" offset="9613058">And Pennsylvania passed a law saying you can't have that kind of term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.625" offset="9628000">And the Court said that that law invalidated the subrogation provisions and therefore it controlled the terms of the insurance policy and therefore it was a law that regulated insurance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2523.482" offset="10235503">California courts have applied it only in the insurance context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.506" offset="10247520">And if you are a party to any kind of other contract in California, a mortgage, a lease, any other kind of contract, and you miss a notice deadline in the policy, you have no assurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.424" offset="10299242">You cannot come into court in California and say, oh, there's a rule that means I don't have to comply with this notice unless the other party who s trying to enforce it can bear the burden of showing substantial prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.831" offset="10344904">That rule, that kind of categorical application, only applies in California to insurance policies, and that's why it's not accurate to say, well, this is really just Restatement section 229.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.748" offset="10392551">In all of the other contexts, if a party is trying to assert that principle that there's a disproportionate... forfeiture would be disproportionate or apply Restatement section 229, you'd have to come before the court in a case by case basis, invoke the court's discretion or equity that in the terms of that particular contract the equities are with you, that it's not a material term of the contract, and you would be the person that would have to bear the burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.437" offset="10499236">But here California by rule has categorically changed it and the rule only applies in insurance policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.461" offset="10523373">And although UNUM has cases where the words "notice" and the words "prejudice" appear fairly close to each other, there's no notice prejudice rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2701.436" offset="10947288">It seems to me that here this rule is really no different than the rules that the Court has already found regulate insurance, such as the anti-subrogation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.032" offset="10989606">And in the National Securities case, when the Court defined for the purposes of the McCarran-Ferguson Act what the scope of the business of insurance was, the Court said that if it's a rule that addresses the relationship between the insurance company and its insured or if it goes to the type of contract that can be issued, its reliability, its enforcement, or its interpretation, that's within the scope of the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.619" offset="11088036">It seems that the Court should apply the same, or that Congress would no doubt... that was said before ERISA was enacted... and when Congress put a savings clause in that let States regulate insurance, that it must have known that that might create some disuniformities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.699" offset="11148326">And the Court has recognized that in Metropolitan Life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.333" offset="11158880">I don't see any conflict here between the ability to change the terms of the contract under the savings clause and then the power to enforce the contract once it's been changed or permissibly altered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.682" offset="11216244">That argument, which UNUM makes, would completely swallow up Metropolitan Life and the FMC versus Holliday case, where in neither of those cases did the insurance... well, in one case, in Metropolitan Life, the policy did not contain the mandated benefit provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.172" offset="11274236">And in FMC, the policy contained a provision that was unenforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.103" offset="11293985">And in both cases, if it's saved it would be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.016" offset="11309554">Under UNUM's approach, the savings clause would just disappear because any time the State exercised the power that Congress gave it to regulate insurance and changed or altered the terms of the policy, then there would be a conflict and it would not be enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.106" offset="11377995">So I don't see any conflict with 502, and obviously the government doesn't see any, either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.983" offset="11401505">I guess I would part also company with UNUM's attempt to rely on this three-part Pireno factor that the Court developed in a different context, which was to decide whether the State law... I'm sorry, whether a particular business practice regulates the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.993" offset="11473498">UNUM has changed the test and substitutes the word UNUM's formulation would be: Does this law constitute the business of insurance?</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.421" offset="11523236">And that's not the test under ERISA.</text>

            <text syncTime="3024.885" offset="12241080">Well, another clue to what we view as the way the Ninth Circuit read the Elfstrom rule was the discussion of the Oregon case where the Ninth Circuit sort of harmonizes Elfstrom and all other rules that are... might initially seem at odds with each other, and comes out saying that Elfstrom is one end of a continuum and there are other cases on the other end of the continuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.680" offset="12336271">And actually we read Elfstrom to require no more... I'm not saying it right because I hadn't focused on this.</text>
