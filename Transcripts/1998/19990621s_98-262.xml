            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="3.403" offset="99595">This is No. 98-262, Martin versus Hadix.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.122" offset="122478">It comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.944" offset="141704">More than 20 years ago, Michigan prison inmates filed two federal class action lawsuits against state prison officials, challenging the conditions of confinement in the Michigan prison system.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.727" offset="192904">More than 10 years ago, in both cases the District Court had concluded that the plaintiffs were prevailing parties and that they were entitled to attorney's fees for postjudgment monitoring of the State's compliance with the remedial orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.262" offset="259046">The District Court established a system for awarding these attorney's fees and set a specific market rate for awarding the fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.678" offset="292692">By 1996 the market rate was set by the Court at a $150 an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.858" offset="317351">On April 26, 1996 however Congress passed the Prison Litigation Reform Act which became effective in April.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.590" offset="364267">The Act as relevant to this case limits the size of the attorney's fees that maybe awarded in prison litigation lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.820" offset="397286">For example, in this case the Act caps fee awards at the maximum hourly rate of a $112.50.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.422" offset="431663">The District Court concluded that the PLRA's fee cap does not limit fees, for work performed before the effective date of the Act, but that it does limit the awards for work performed after the effective date of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.675" offset="492685">On appeal the Sixth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.026" offset="510031">The Court of Appeals concluded that the Act's fees provision does not apply for cases such as the cases here that were pending when the Act was enacted, regardless of when the work was performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.549" offset="564156">In an opinion filed with the Clerk of the Court today, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.215" offset="586831">In determining whether a new law like the Prison Litigation Reform Act applies to pending cases, we ask first whether congress has expressly prescribed the statute's temporal reach, in other words what it is going to apply to and when.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.360" offset="659451">In this case we conclude that Congress has not spoken to the temporal reach of the fees provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.619" offset="688395">As a result we ask the next question, whether application of the fees provision to the case here would have a retroactive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.132" offset="726533">In this case we conclude that the Act's fees provision would have a retroactive effect when applied to work performed before the effective date of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.415" offset="767598">The attorneys in these cases had a reasonable expectation that the work they performed before the enactment of the Prison Litigation Reform Act would be compensated at the rate set by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.448" offset="819738">To apply the Act, the fees cap the work performed before its effective date would alter this arrangement post hoc by reducing that rate of compensation because this type of retroactive effect would be inconsistent with our traditional presumption against retroactivity, we decline to apply the Act retroactively in the absence of an expressed directive by Congress to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.429" offset="927676">By contrast, the Act's fees provision, as applied to work performed after the effective date of the Act, does not have a retroactive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.076" offset="974279">There is no retroactivity problem in telling a lawyer that going forward; any work the attorney performs will be at a lower hourly rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.876" offset="1013462">If the attorney does not want to work at the new lower rate she can decline the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.439" offset="1035719">Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.458" offset="1055781">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment; Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part which is joined by Justice Stevens.</text>
