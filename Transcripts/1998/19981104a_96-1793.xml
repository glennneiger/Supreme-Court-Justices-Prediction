            <text syncTime="53.415" offset="360770">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="63.062" offset="399431">The Federal statute, the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, specifically provides that school districts are not required to provide medical services to students except for evaluation and diagnostic purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.992" offset="459095">Therefore, the fundamental issue in this case is whether nursing services which must be continuous and exclusive for one student constitutes medical services.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.609" offset="501622">When we go to a physician's office and we see a nurse, and the nurse gives us an injection, we certainly think we're getting a medical service.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.256" offset="536209">Similarly, if we go to a dialysis clinic and a technician administers dialysis we think we're getting medical services.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="107.881" offset="578631">Ms. Seitz, I follow what you're saying, but we do have the Tatro case, and I would have said in one sense the CIC is a medical service, so it seems to me, at least from your brief, that you're not resting on the character of the care that's rendered...  is it a catheter, or what it is...  but the volume of it and the cost, so it's...  the nature of the service seems to be not part of your calculus.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.644" offset="709766">In other words, if you took this string of care-giving and you broke it down and you just had one, would you say, oh, that's not...  that's a medical service, it's not diagnostic?</text>

            <label>Ms. Susan L. Seitz</label>
            <text syncTime="153.132" offset="759712">Justice Ginsburg, catheterization, even clean intermittent catheterization, is also commonly thought of as a medical service.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.329" offset="792417">However, we have to find a balance between those things that are the broad medical service and those things which are school nursing services which are required under the regulations as a related service, so somehow we have to find a test that will be, what is a school health service provided by a school nurse versus those things that are just generally thought of as medical?</text>
            <text syncTime="182.033" offset="875278">Certainly, CIC, as this Court found, was a service that could be provided by a school nurse in a short period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.126" offset="903595">In fact, Amber Tatro was the young girl and was quickly going to be able to...</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="191.737" offset="914044">But my question to you is, are you saying every one of these services on the list fits within the medical service exception, or they do cumulatively but not individually?</text>

            <label>Ms. Susan L. Seitz</label>
            <text syncTime="205.368" offset="968587">Justice Ginsburg, we're saying they do cumulatively, because obviously the Cedar Rapids Community School District does provide clean intermittent catheterization to other students.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.122" offset="1007666">They also section tracheostomies for other students.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.724" offset="1022086">But the difference is, those are services that can be done by a school nurse, or someone trained by the school nurse, versus having to hire a person full-time to attend to that child all day.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="229.424" offset="1064822">Well, so you stipulate that the tracheotomy procedure is...  can be a nursing service?</text>

            <text syncTime="242.721" offset="1118008">The...  if it was just...  in fact, we have other students in the Cedar Rapids District who have suction of tracheostomy tubes.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.507" offset="1145175">That by itself could be done by a school nurse, and that school nurse could continue to perform his or her other functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.252" offset="1172133">The difference with Garrett is that he needs continuous monitoring and assessment to make sure that he's not in respiratory distress, and at that point then the school nurse cannot perform those functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.040" offset="1219258">There are only six nurses in Cedar Rapids.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.818" offset="1382367">Well, but you...  it seems to me you, even on that assumption you've got a problem, because the testimony in the case was, as I understand it, that you don't even need a nurse to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.324" offset="1420401">My recollection is that the ALJ found that any, you know, competent person could be trained to do these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.868" offset="1450599">The reason, as I understand it, that a nurse would be required in Iowa is because the Iowa nursing regulations so provide, but it seems to me that's Iowa's problem and it doesn't have anything to do with the way we should draw the definitional line under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.370" offset="1512666">So that even on your assumption, that the statute said in effect, or meant, that continuous service by a nurse would be within the exclusion, that in fact is not the case here except under the Iowa regulations, and surely the Iowa regulations can't govern the meaning of the Federal statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="361.912" offset="1594795">Your Honor, first, you're correct that the Iowa Board of Nursing did rule his care needed to be provided by a nurse.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.087" offset="1619454">However, the services that could be delegated, even to a lay person, are clearly medical services that would typically be either performed or supervised by the nurse.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.922" offset="1654876">Then the criterion then is not the continuous nature of the service or the, in effect the ultimate cost, it is in a more strictly analytical sense it's the kind of service itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="3336.629" offset="13493675">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.511" offset="13505169">I would like to address just a couple of questions that were raised of my colleague, Ms. Brinkmann.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.213" offset="13523977">I believe that Justice Scalia asked why if a nurse is making assessments of his health condition that doesn't fall under the exception to the exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.328" offset="13556473">That's because the diagnostic and evaluation services referred to in the statute are diagnostic and evaluation services for determining eligibility for special education under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.205" offset="13603911">It's not dealing with diagnosis and evaluation of a medical condition for medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.771" offset="13626272">Okay, I'd also like to deal with Ms. Brinkmann's discussion of the agency proposed rule-making in 1982...  excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.326" offset="13660440">I'm looking, and I...  this is not cited in any of the appendix, so I'm going to have to give you a citation to the Federal Register.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.220" offset="13688026">It's Volume 47, and it appears at page 33,838, probably...  excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.917" offset="13726791">33846 through 33848.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.781" offset="13746226">In fact, the proposed agency regulations in 1982, it says in the prelude, the prologue to the proposed regulation, the most persistent problems involve determining whether certain health-related services are to be provided, clearly finding that there was confusion over what was a medical service, over what was a related service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.624" offset="13841626">It does not say there was a longstanding bright line rule going back to 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.919" offset="13862837">Nor do I think you can look at the statutory amendment in '83 as ratifying the bright line, because if you look at the proposed regulation in the area of medical services, what was being proposed by the Secretary in 1982 was to exclude all life sustaining procedures that could be performed under sterile conditions...  that would be CIC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.153" offset="13959804">It would have been clearly excluded...  must be administered by licensed health care professionals, would have excluded all school nursing services, medication administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.880" offset="13998674">Just because Congress went on in 1983 and said you can't lessen the procedural or substantive rights, I don't think you can say they endorsed a bright line physician-non...</text>

            <text syncTime="3477.260" offset="14056143">That's correct, and there were six areas, not just related services that were being proposed, amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.103" offset="14079549">I don't think we can draw any conclusion from that legislative amendment in '83.</text>

            <text syncTime="3497.484" offset="14137123">I don't think that we can...  when Ms. Brinkmann said that we have not cited any agency regulation on excluded...  any agency interpretation on excluded medical services, I agree, there aren't any agency regulations or interpretations on excluded, so you have to look to the case law.</text>
