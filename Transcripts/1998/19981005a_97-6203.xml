            <text syncTime="11.106" offset="192181">The issues presented by Mr. Jones' case are, first, whether in selecting certain factors to increase the sentence from carjacking from 15 years maximum to 25 to life, Congress intended those factors be considered only at the time of sentencing under a reduced standard of proof, or did they... Congress intend that they be elements of an offense which would have to be pled and proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.721" offset="294581">We believe that the proper interpretation is that these are offense elements.</text>

            <text syncTime="489.308" offset="2104971">And when they assert punishment, sometimes it's a little punishment and sometimes a bigger punishment, and you can look into it scientifically with the aid of search and find out what in general bigger or littler turns on, and when we find that out we find certain factors, like how much drug there was, like whether a person was hurt, like whether there was a recidivist, and that turns out to be true regardless of what the judge says.</text>

            <text syncTime="1556.043" offset="6371917">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.262" offset="6392815">In our view, Congress intended serious bodily injury to be a sentencing factor, statutory sentencing factor under section 2119, and nothing in the Constitution requires that it be treated as an element of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.505" offset="6441716">Let me pause for a moment in the language and structure of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.124" offset="6456240">The initial paragraph, section 2119, as it applies here, sets out exactly what you would expect from a Federal carjacking offense, taking a car that is moved in commerce, in the person or presence of another, possessing a firearm, force and violence... it's a very standard robbery offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.883" offset="6519247">That initial paragraph ends with the word shall, followed by a dash, leaving the reader to think, all right, now I'm going to find out about penalties, and then you have three numbered clauses that follow that that do deal with penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.357" offset="6569193">One is for a default penalty of up to 15 years, and then two progressively higher sentences that are authorized maximum sentences that are authorized if certain findings are made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.665" offset="6614333">In our view, the natural and plain construction of that language is that these are statutory sentencing factors, and that's what the courts below have held.</text>

            <text syncTime="1640.880" offset="6711195">I think one reason for that is suggested, in fact, by Justice Stevens' dissent in McMillan, which is that there are some real-world constraints here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2774.901" offset="11247306">I mean, the whole system is that you give the defendant notice of what the charges are so he can decide what to defend.</text>

            <text syncTime="2916.610" offset="11814163">Well, the Court has given a variety of clues along the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.212" offset="11828583">It certainly has clearly stated that a State or a legislature cannot define something as an element of the offense and then presume that it exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.068" offset="11855959">If you are going to define something as an element of the offense, then you have to send it to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.020" offset="11871842">That's one thing the Court has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.639" offset="11878320">There is a question of fundamental fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.007" offset="11887724">There might be circumstances under which fundamental fairness would require, says the Court, that something be treated as an element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.344" offset="11913115">That is what the Court has said, and I cannot give you a good answer on how to give more content to that, except that we will probably know that we have a serious issue when one arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.665" offset="11946343">I don't think that any such issue arises under this statute, because here we have a very serious, very violent offense, defined in wholly conventional terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.854" offset="11979153">If you look at this, it is a robbery offense all the way up until the word shall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.123" offset="11992214">There is nothing unconventional about that offense, except perhaps that Congress added the element of possessing a firearm, which is an additional protection, and what you have below the shall are extremely conventional sentencing factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.781" offset="12038816">Here's a basic sentence we think is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.716" offset="12046549">If, however, there's victim harm that rises to a serious bodily injury, then it's more serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.786" offset="12066820">If there's victim harm that goes to death, it's very serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.904" offset="12079358">There's nothing in that whole structure that we think remotely challenges whatever constitutional limits there may be on how Congress can define offenses, and that's, I'm afraid, the best I can do for you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3002.266" offset="12156785">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.985" offset="12163682">I would like to address quickly, if I could, the statutory question, which we believe this statute should be construed as not setting forth sentencing factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.091" offset="12200044">The Government's position is that, to identify three offenses in the text of the section, the statute's three penalty clauses would have to be read as alternative completions for the offense definition begun in the initial paragraph, and each completed alternative, taken as a whole, would then be read to define a separate criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.052" offset="12267962">We believe that's exactly what happened there, that if you take everything before the dash, you do not have a criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.789" offset="12298891">It does not say it's unlawful, it does not say it is prohibited, it does not say it will be punished in a certain way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.193" offset="12320521">It is only when you go past the dash to 1, 2, and 3 that you get alternative completions to that... to the introductory part, alternative offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.816" offset="12358973">But if the Court should not rule in our favor on the statutory construction question, on the constitutional question, I'd like to make one more try, if I could, on what I... what we believe is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.523" offset="12401814">It appears that what the legislature does in enacting a criminal offense is, it tells the citizenry that if you engage in particular conduct, then you will be sentenced... you will potentially face a particular sentence, a certain loss of liberty, and then we know that behind that, behind the Constitution is the idea that those facts, that to establish that conduct which leads to that loss of liberty is something that goes to a jury and is proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.143" offset="12520305">We think that what the Court should hold is, if there's any fact that the legislature singles out from a transaction, from the citizen's conduct, whether it is an action, whether it is a mental state, or whether it's a result, that should be treated as an element of the offense, and it ought to go to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.254" offset="12592717">A jury trial is not something that has to be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.473" offset="12605569">A jury is... under our jurisprudence is supposed to be the most reliable determiner of that, and we would have a higher... this... the whole idea is kind of, if we can hide these as sentencing factors, we won't let a jury deal with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.133" offset="12656246">That seems to me contrary to our Constitution, to the values that we have in proof beyond a reasonable doubt and jury trials, and I think what I've suggested to you would fit very easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.739" offset="12694699">All it means is that there would be a different definition given to the jury and they would play their traditional role of making factual findings about the defendant that subjects that defendant to a particular punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.879" offset="12739211">I think that that is... that seems to me that's consonant with our Constitution and with those valued principles, and this trying to somehow say we can treat it differently, we can call it a sentencing factor, we can go over the standard, we can get the jury out of it, just is contrary to what we think criminal offenses are and what they mean to our citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.524" offset="12817788">They should know, if you do this, you will have a right to have a jury determine it, and if you... and if they find that you've engaged in that conduct, then you could be sentenced in this particular way.</text>
