            <text syncTime="15.860" offset="209412">Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 prevents a covered jurisdiction from implementing any new voting practice that has the purpose to discriminate against racial minorities even if that purpose is not retrogressive.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.269" offset="266986">Section 5's purpose prong is not limited to an intent to make matters worse for minorities, and section 5 also places the burden of proof on the covered jurisdiction to show that its new voting practice does not have the purpose to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.945" offset="325709">The text and the Court's decisions and the background of section 5 all support those points.</text>

            <text syncTime="89.224" offset="502820">First of all, after all, section 5 has been applied by the Attorney General and by the preclearance courts this way for 30 years, not limited to a retrogressive purpose, and yet there are many section 2 cases brought in the covered jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.365" offset="559349">This Court has had several.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.750" offset="564887">Mobile v. Bolden was a section 2 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.519" offset="575963">Rogers v. Lodge was a section 2 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.138" offset="586516">Thornburgh v. Gingles was a section 2 case, even though parts of North Carolina are covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.355" offset="607309">There are at least two very important areas where section 2 remains vital.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.909" offset="625595">First, of course, is where the challenged practice predates the Voting Rights Act, and in many covered jurisdictions in that area there are at-large voting practices and multimember voting practices and what-have-you that predate 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.455" offset="691737">Section 2 also remains very important for fact patterns like Beer and like Thornburgh v. Gingles, that is, where there was not a retrogressive effect, and the evidence does not indicate anything to show that the jurisdiction had a discriminatory purpose but nonetheless the plan has a very serious, relatively adverse impact on minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.420" offset="795600">There are many reported section 2 cases in covered jurisdictions on the books, and I think it, given the history... this is not a new interpretation of section 5 that we are advancing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.544" offset="840113">It's the one that has been applied, and it's consistent with Arlington Heights.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.513" offset="855995">Ever since this Court decided Arlington Heights in 1976, almost... just after it decided Beer, the Attorney General has followed the Arlington Heights factors to determine whether an enactment has a retro... has a discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.606" offset="920361">The preclearance court in the District of Columbia, as far as we know, other than this case, has never limited its search to a retrogressive purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.461" offset="955783">In addition, there are at least two cases in this Court where we submit, where the Court has rendered decisions that are fundamentally irreconcilable with the construction of section 5 that the board advances today.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.221" offset="1014820">Mr. Wolfson, before you go on with that, I just wanted to make sure that I understood you correctly to say that section 2 often works when there is a dilutive effect, even though you can't prove any malevolent purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="240.669" offset="1108651">You would have to have this malevolent purpose, so that would leave a great office for section 2 in dilutive effect cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.644" offset="1152537">In addition, the Court's precedents really foreclose the proposition that is relied on today.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.714" offset="1176779">City of Pleasant Grove in particular is irreconcilable with the submission that section 5 is limited to a retrogressive purpose, as opposed to a discriminatory purpose more broadly conceived.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.606" offset="1228397">That case involved an all-white town that annexed an all-white enclave and a... an all-white parcel, rather, and a vacant parcel, and refused to annex a parcel in which black residents were living, and the argument that was made by the City of Pleasant Grove in this case was exactly the one that is made today, which is, we know there is no retrogressive effect, so the effect is not bad under section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.840" offset="1329334">We know that there could not have been a retrogressive effect because the city officials were not aware of any black residents of the town at the time, so how can it possibly be said that there is a discriminatory purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="316.503" offset="1411985">--Well, first of all, Mr. Chief Justice, let me say the question about how far the Congress can go beyond the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment really is not implicated in this case, because this case involves a core discriminatory purpose, or at least that is what is in contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.779" offset="1481053">Now, whatever... however far Congress can go, the question about whether... the issue about a core discriminatory purpose against racial minorities is fundamentally what the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment is about, so we're not talking about going--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="347.439" offset="1535701">But how far can the Congress go in directing the Attorney General to supervise those States which are under the Voting Rights Act, under preclearance orders?</text>
            <text syncTime="363.382" offset="1599440">I... the Chief Justice can explain his own question, but I was... it seems to me that if you depart from retrogression as the baseline that the Attorney General must follow, then the Attorney General has vastly greater discretion and vastly greater responsibilities in preclearance procedures, and that may put the constitutionality of the intervention in State Voting Rights Acts in an entirely new light.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Paul R. Q. Wolfson</label>
            <text syncTime="393.068" offset="1718245">--Well, there's certainly no question that section 5 is an an unusual statute, and it has, without doubt, federalism costs, as the Court has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.657" offset="1752518">However, the Court has three times examined the constitutionality of section 5 and has upheld it.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.894" offset="1777491">Many of these arguments were the arguments that were raised in South Carolina v. Katzenbach.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.631" offset="1800478">The question was raised, how is that the Congress can require the States to come to Washington to prove that the... that their enactments do not have a discriminatory purpose, and the Court said, it is unusual, but, given the sensitivity of the interest that is at stake, which is the right to vote, and given the importance of protecting that right against discrimination on the basis of race, that this is an acceptable cost, and it is within Congress' power to enact.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.115" offset="1910402">Now, in South Carolina v. Katzenbach, there was certainly no suggestion that the kind of purpose that was at issue there was limited to a retrogressive purpose, and each time Congress has looked at this act again, and it's reenacted it three times, it has considered these constitutional questions very carefully... they are serious ones... and it has said, the interests at stake are serious enough that the preclearance remedy is still necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="522.416" offset="2235574">The purpose prong addresses those enactments that violate the Constitution itself, and the effect prong does go beyond it, and it inhibits the enforcement of those enactments which, although not animated by a discriminatory purpose, nonetheless present the risk of eroding those gains that have been made, and that was the issue before the Court in City of Rome.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.246" offset="2322927">In City of Rome, the court said, section 5 has two functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.300" offset="2343094">One is to ameliorate discrimination, and the other is to prevent against further erosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.704" offset="2360753">Many of these arguments, many of these serious concerns about section 5 have been aired in City of Rome and in Katzenbach, and there's no doubt, as I've said, that section 5 is unusual, but... but the question about whether it reaches what the Constitution itself prohibits is not a question... it does not implicate the concerns about whether the outer reaches of section 5 might present some constitutional difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.402" offset="2463571">What Congress intended above all was to enforce what it called the explicit commands of the fifteenth Amendment, and to make sure that new enactments did not violate the Constitution, and that's what this is about.</text>

            <text syncTime="1150.222" offset="4746777">If the goal of the Voting Rights Act to eliminate discrimination in voting is to be fulfilled, the purpose clause of section 5 should not be restricted to a meaning more narrow than the basic fundamental constitutional framework for assessing discriminatory intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.533" offset="4820025">If I might begin on the point Justice Scalia asked toward the end of Mr. Wolfson's argument with respect to the plain language of section 5, there's an important countervailing principle of statutory interpretation that would be violated by reading effect in the statute to mean only retrogression and purpose to mean only retrogression, and that is that the purpose prong would become virtually meaningless in practical impact.</text>

            <text syncTime="1915.395" offset="7807492">A Mississippi jurisdiction has a law that says no one can vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.697" offset="7824733">All section 5 said under South Carolina v. Katzenbach was, look, don't make your other voting procedures worse to replace the law we have just gotten rid of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.838" offset="7865275">If those procedures stay the same, if the registration hours and all of the registration qualification stayed the same, and after all, they were designed for an all-white electorate, then you haven't filled the discriminatory gap that's left when the Voting Rights Act itself eliminates the law that says blacks can't vote, so that's a perfect example of what I'm talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.251" offset="7950957">You've got a law that says, blacks can't vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.686" offset="7964645">Then the jurisdiction comes along and says, look, we're going to increase filing fees for candidates, because now blacks can vote, we want to make sure they don't get to run for office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.928" offset="8009680">Now, let's assume they reduce the filing fee, so it was retrogressive, from $100 to $75, but the NAACP says, you should have reduced it to $50, and you find that the failure to reduce the filing fee to $50 was motivated by a discriminatory purpose, what would you do under section 5?</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.841" offset="8089301">You would deny the reduction of the filing fee to $75.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.209" offset="8106751">You would put back in place the filing fee of $100, the fee that was worse for black candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.565" offset="8136217">And Congress understood that since the remedy under section 5 is to deny the change and restore the status quo, you only want to deny the change when it's worse than the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.690" offset="8184700">You never want to deny the change when it's better than the status quo, i.e., nonretrogressive, because then you'd go back to the discriminatory status quo.</text>

            <text syncTime="2090.492" offset="8507887">See, if the status quo is discriminatory, section 5 can't get at it, because section 5 is triggered only when there's a change to the status quo, and this remedy again is to restore the status quo, so if you have a discriminatory status quo, section 5 is powerless to change that, and that's what Congress realized.</text>

            <text syncTime="2200.648" offset="8948521">--Right, but what do you look at?</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.948" offset="8953745">Do you look at whether or not they intended to cause the injury, to go back to Justice Scalia's analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.969" offset="8973807">If you have... for example, under the law, if you defame somebody negligently, you cannot be held liable, but if you intentionally defame them, you can be held liable, because we agree that intentionally inflicting an injury is worse than negligently doing so, but in both instances you must defame the other person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.697" offset="9048727">There must be a defamatory statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.132" offset="9058444">And in this case, there must be retrogression to come within the legally cognizable injury addressed by section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.905" offset="9093553">Otherwise, you open up the very narrow section 5 proceeding to encompass all sorts of the free-floating purpose inquiry that was referenced before and dramatically increase the burden on the covered jurisdiction in three ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.765" offset="9153007">First of all, you subject the covered jurisdiction to duplicative litigation and inconsistent judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.919" offset="9181638">Under appellants' theory of section 5, the small Louisiana parish comes up to the district court in D.C., proves itself innocent of any potential constitutional violation, and it means nothing, because the next day they can be sued in Louisiana District Court under section 2 and the Fifteenth Amendment, and section 5 strips them of any res judicata defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.534" offset="9276096">Well, obviously, when section 5 said you can have a follow-on proceeding in the local district court, it was not intending that you have precisely the same trial in the District of Columbia one day and in Louisiana the next.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.027" offset="9330013">It intended that the section 5 court would deal with section 5 issues, and it intended that the district court would deal with the constitutional issues, the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment violations that they address every day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.768" offset="9384975">The second problem for the covered jurisdictions is, you create an insoluble dilemma for them, as this Court noted in Miller and Shaw.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.206" offset="9418725">If the covered jurisdiction fails to subordinate traditional districting principles to create a majority-minority district, the Justice Department will find that they have a "discriminatory purpose", as they did in this case because the parish refused to violate State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.902" offset="9485494">On the other hand, if they do subordinate traditional districting principles to create majority-minority districts, then they will have violated the Fourteenth Amendment under Shaw and the gerrymandering cases, and this Court has noted that the jurisdictions need some breathing space to reconcile the competing interests under those two laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.066" offset="9570235">They need to have some ability not to violate the Voting Rights Act and to comply with the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.735" offset="9592909">I submit that that breathing space will be gone under this regime.</text>

            <text syncTime="2366.254" offset="9610986">Counsel, as I understand, part of your argument is that, as a matter of textual analysis and as a matter simply of common sense analysis, there would be something very strange in saying that abridgement with respect to its effects can refer only as this Court has said, to retrogression, whereas a purpose to abridge might be broader to include, among other things, dilution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.357" offset="9723313">It seems to me that in part of your argument this morning you've given a response to that, and I want to know whether I've understood you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.562" offset="9756227">You pointed out that one of the difficulties with the concept of dilution is that there really isn't any benchmark ready-made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.168" offset="9798650">We know what the benchmark is on retrogression simply by definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.787" offset="9813069">It's the status quo you start from, and you do have your benchmark.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.524" offset="9828011">When you're talking about dilution, you don't have a ready-made bench mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.226" offset="9846820">You have to, in effect, choose one somewhere, and it seems to me that... I mean, I think there's a lot of force in your point there, but that also seems to lead to this, that if we don't know whether a non... or if it's very difficult, conceptually, to decide how to determine whether a nonretrogressive change is dilutive or not, the way we do it is to look to purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.216" offset="9982761">Was the purpose in effect to dilute, to in effect to mean that the vote will be less effective than the vote of the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.422" offset="10027587">And simply because purpose is so important in determining dilution, whereas effect may not, in fact, be a basis for finding dilution at all, or at least it may be conceptually difficult, it seems to me that it makes perfect sense to say that a statute would want to proscribe an abridgement effect limited only to retrogression, but would want to proscribe an intent that includes both retrogressive and dilutive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.411" offset="10163528">Have I misunderstood your point, and if I haven't, is that suggestion unsound?</text>

            <text syncTime="2530.310" offset="10267182">Even at the benchmark level, it's tough to figure out what is dilutive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.761" offset="10280975">As the Court pointed out in Johnson v. De Grandy and the Voinivich case, it's hard to even know whether or not a black majority district is less or more dilutive than a 45-percent, so you have to litigate all of those issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="2739.345" offset="11103309">First of all, I agree with you that the real problem here is not who has the burden of persuasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.515" offset="11123998">The real problem is injecting us into this amorphous constitutional purpose inquiry in the narrow section 5 proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.003" offset="11153987">I think that generally the cases in the 2000 redistricting cycle are going to be close cases, with very difficult, if you go too far, do you violate Shaw, so maybe the burden of persuasion will be outcome-determinative in those cases more typically than they would in other kinds of circumstances, because we all recognize that in redistricting you are considering race at some level of abstraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.970" offset="11249804">Whether that's a discriminatory consideration or not is a question that's bedeviled this Court in the gerrymandering cases, and I think would bedevil the lower courts as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.159" offset="11290555">My third point is, if they are close cases, of course, that is the kind of burden that you particularly don't want to put on the covered jurisdiction, because if it's a close case where a trial judge could go one way or another, the Justice Department and the minority plaintiffs have all the more incentives to bring the follow-on case in Louisiana that I described earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.138" offset="11366519">Because they say, look, it was a coin toss, we might as well get a free second bite at the apple, leading to even more litigation than you have typically involved in redistricting and, of course, the follow-on lawsuit by the nonminorities in the jurisdiction we said that remedy that the Justice Department was trying to force on you violated our rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2848.982" offset="11541853">The reason section 5 was enacted was that there was a game going on in the south in which every time there was an adjudication there was an immediate change in the law which in effect put the jurisdiction one step ahead of the courts, and the litigation had to start all over again, and I would have supposed that the very point of section 5, whether the issue might be close in litigation or not close in litigation, was to put the burden precisely on the covered districts, and I don't know why it is sound for you to stand here and argue that, in fact, this is somehow an offense against federalism.</text>
