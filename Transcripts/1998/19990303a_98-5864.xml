            <text syncTime="62.100" offset="395269">My client was found guilty of abduction, robbery, and capital murder on the basis of testimony by a purported eye witness who claimed at trial that he had seen him forcibly abduct the murder victim in the parking lot of a busy shopping mall.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.872" offset="466322">That testimony went largely unimpeached, because the Commonwealth of Virginia withheld evidence that cast significant doubt on the reliability and truthfulness of the purported eye witness.</text>

            <text syncTime="95.355" offset="528285">First, that Virginia clearly violated the rule of Brady v. Maryland, by withhold material exculpatory evidence; and, second, that there is nothing in this Court's habeas case law that authorizes the withholding of a remedy for that clear violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="187.045" offset="895044">In connection with a contemplated filing of Federal habeas, but before any papers were actually filed for Federal habeas, the district court, under this Court's ruling in McFarland v. Coz, named counsel for petitioner so that he could help him with the Federal habeas papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.422" offset="1000579">The record discloses that the district court also issued an order that was not directed at any particular claim but that did authorize new counsel to secure pretty much anything in the world that would have my client's name on it, including the files ultimately found to contain the evidence at issue here.</text>

            <text syncTime="300.208" offset="1347694">In fact, the factual bases for the ineffective assistance claim that was pled in the State habeas is a basis that would not give us a freestanding Brady claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.098" offset="1399207">If you look at what we claim in State habeas is in effect that counsel failed to do so many things that he was in effect absent, he might as well have been a bump in the log, and it was based on a legal theory that was wholly directed to the first prong of the Strickland test.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.502" offset="1484889">In other words, counsel for the State habeas case sat down with the trial record and in 25 pages listed 96 instances of things that the lawyer did not, that seemed from the record were not done, that tended to indicate that for all intents and purposes he might as well have been not there.</text>

            <text syncTime="379.359" offset="1664298">--But that's ineffective assistance of counsel, certainly it must be ineffective assistance of counsel because the Brady violation at least theoretically would have turned up something.</text>

            <text syncTime="389.167" offset="1703481">--Mr. Chief Justice, that is the legal theory under which one would usually plead an ineffective assistance claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.643" offset="1733366">It is possible, and it is certainly open under this Court's cases, to say that someone who at every turn failed to do everything you would expect of a lawyer in a criminal trial might as well not have been there, such that if he was, indeed, absent from the trial, you don't need to show any actual harm with respect to any individual ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.795" offset="1818002">Now, one may not agree with the legal theory, but all I need to show here is that the legal theory is not one that would give notice of the actual existence of a Brady claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="430.434" offset="1868575">But in any case, I think it's also your argument that, even assuming that they would sensibly have thought at least of a Brady claim, there would still have been cause here, because, consistently throughout the litigation, the Commonwealth of Virginia had taken the position that in fact they had an open file and therefore that, after all, would be cause not to pursue the claim any further than you went.</text>

            <text syncTime="460.823" offset="1990097">Not only did they say at page 212 and page 213 of the J.A.... that's at the outset of Volume 2... that from the outset of litigation, i.e., from the trial, we have been in compliance with Brady through the open file so that it was a representation that they had always been in compliance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2704.530" offset="10964935">There was no prejudice, because even if she hadn't testified, Strickler never contested that he abducted and robbed Whitlock.</text>
