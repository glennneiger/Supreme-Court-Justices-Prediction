            <text syncTime="52.356" offset="356439">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="57.750" offset="377963">The two consolidated courses... cases here arose from uranium mining and milling activity that occurred on the Navajo reservation some 40 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.086" offset="423312">The petitioners or their predecessors produced this uranium under licenses and contracts with the Atomic Energy Commission and sold it to the Government under the Government's uranium procurement program.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.325" offset="472318">All of the uranium was used for military purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.187" offset="487782">Some decades after the uranium operations closed down, my clients were sued in Navajo Tribal Court by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.562" offset="525190">The respondents are members of the Navajo Tribe, and they claim that from long-term exposure to uranium and other hazardous properties produced by the petitioners' operations, they suffered injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.992" offset="579002">The claims in tribal court were pleaded entirely under tribal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.164" offset="599691">It is our basic contention in this case that claims of nuclear tort such as those raised by respondents must be heard under Federal law and that, under the relevant Federal law, the defendants are entitled to a Federal forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.437" offset="664788">Congress visited this issue of nuclear torts on more than a half-dozen occasions over the last 40 years, and in the Atomic Energy Act itself, in the Price-Anderson provisions of the Atomic Energy Act, Congress developed a rather elaborate set of procedural and substantive rules to govern how nuclear torts should be treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.009" offset="750992">And these rules reflect a legislative judgment on how to balance the public's need for safety, the public's need for compensation if safety is lacking, on the one hand, and the national need for a domestic uranium industry that is not subject to uncontrolled, unstructured tort liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.288" offset="1276158">That issue was properly before the court of appeals jurisdictionally.</text>

            <label>Mr. James R. Atwood</label>
            <text syncTime="289.654" offset="1305624">No, it... it decided two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.195" offset="1315759">It affirmed the denial of the injunction that we sought, and it reversed sua sponte the grant of the other part of the injunction that we sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.570" offset="1353271">So there's clearly one very important substantive issue that came up properly jurisdictionally, and that is the question, were the tribal law claims preempted by the Price-Anderson Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.628" offset="1401545">On the issue where the court of appeals reversed and it was not appealed, in a sense, it's not your fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.066" offset="1435296">You don't have the duty to appeal a favorable ruling.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="325.408" offset="1448670">On the other hand, the court of appeals is in somewhat of a difficult position if it feels that the unappealed ruling and its rationale are logically necessary for its decision on the part that is appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.188" offset="1503737">I'm not quite sure what the court of appeals should have done.</text>

            <label>Mr. James R. Atwood</label>
            <text syncTime="341.160" offset="1511678">Well, there... I think there is a distinction between what orders were before the court and what orders are before this Court, and therefore what the relief should be, with the question of how broad the analysis needs to be to properly decide the issues that are before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.581" offset="1577297">And it is perfectly understandable, I think, that the Ninth Circuit and this Court, in deciding the preemption issues that are presented, would want to analyze the totality of the relationship of the Price-Anderson Act regime with what has happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.224" offset="1643857">So it is certainly possible that the substantive analysis would be somewhat broad, but then when you get down to an appropriate relief, in our judgment it should be to reverse the court of appeals insofar as it allowed the tribal court causes of action to go forward and to vacate the court of appeals judgment insofar as it prohibited Price-Anderson claims from going forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.132" offset="1751482">We--</text>

            <text syncTime="401.372" offset="1752527">Mr. Atwood, let me tell you my problem with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.853" offset="1762453">It seems to me that that asks us to decide a question which, in the light of the question that you want us to forego, may well be utterly academic.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.494" offset="1824938">That is to say, if Price-Anderson claims can be brought in tribal court, contrary to the injunction here that you want us to leave in place, if they can be brought in tribal court, then it makes no difference... it is asking an academic question whether you will allow the tribal court to consider and will allow it to exhaust whether a particular claim is a Price-Anderson claim or not a Price-Anderson claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.620" offset="1973418">That question is a nonquestion if both claims can be brought in tribal court, and you don't want us to reach the question of whether both claims can be brought in tribal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.988" offset="2014901">You say that's been decided, and that injunction wasn't appealed, so forget about that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.390" offset="2032559">But unless that question is answered in the opposite way from the way the district court answered it, namely, answered to say you cannot bring... I'm sorry, you can... you... yes... no... the way the district court answered it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1235.638" offset="5089513">The parties agree that the Federal courts have Federal question jurisdiction to decide at some point whether these nuclear tort claims brought initially under tribal law fall within the preemptive scope of the Price-Anderson Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.897" offset="5142594">The question here is whether the prudential rule of tribal court exhaustion delays the date on which the Federal courts will decide that issue, even though, as Justice Ginsburg points out, if this suit had been filed in State court, the Federal courts would indisputably decide that issue now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.238" offset="5203929">The answer is that the tribal exhaustion doctrine does not have that anomalous consequence, and the reason is specific to the Price-Anderson Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.313" offset="5236217">The act deems any claim for public liability brought under any source of law to be a Federal claim arising directly under Price-Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.319" offset="5272265">Congress designed that complete preemption regime to make Federal court review available from the inception of any nuclear tort suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.383" offset="5304553">Congress took that step because it wanted to make nuclear tort litigation more predictable, more uniform, and more efficient, because it wanted to ensure consolidation of any related cases, and because it wished to ensure centralized control over compensation claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1634.626" offset="6685490">The 1988 amendments expanded the scope of the removal statute to extend beyond extraordinary nuclear occurrences to include all nuclear incidents, of which we claim these suits are an example, but there's no indication anywhere in the legislative history that Congress contemplated that tribal courts would adjudicate these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.128" offset="6759469">And the important point also is that tribal court adjudication of these claims without any mechanism for transfer to a Federal court which would have centralized control over the litigation and centralized control over compensation funds would present all of the problems that motivated Congress in 1988 to expand the removal provision at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.434" offset="6840762">It would clearly frustrate this statutory scheme to permit suits to proceed in tribal court over the objection of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.987" offset="6862914">Ultimately, on the merits issue the parties address, we agree with petitioners that these tort suits do, in fact, fall within the scope of the Price-Anderson Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.997" offset="6922995">That follows from the plain language of the definitions of nuclear incident and public liability as they appear in section 2014.</text>

            <text syncTime="1839.996" offset="7506989">Before turning to the jurisdictional question that makes this case, I think, particularly perplexing as it comes to this Court, I would like just to take a moment at the outset to explain why I think the decision below, assuming for a moment that the court of appeals had the power to render it, was, in fact, a proper accommodation of the Price-Anderson Act and the doctrine of tribal exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.533" offset="7613150">First of all, the decision below carried forth both Congress' policy of respecting the jurisdiction of tribal courts and also, in particular, its policy of allowing tribal plaintiffs to choose tribal courts as a forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.404" offset="7680651">That policy is reflected in the absence of removal provisions generally from tribal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1912.023" offset="7795067">In addition to this respect for the right of tribal courts and tribal plaintiffs, what the court did was avoid the problem of having litigants running back and forth between the Federal and the tribal courts, which is a central idea behind the idea--</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="1946.856" offset="7934457">That would be true, but the fact is that the tribal exhaustion doctrine in its basic core element is intended to say, unless there is a clear lack of jurisdiction in the tribal courts, the idea is that the issues with respect to jurisdiction are considered first by the tribal court and then subsequently by the Federal court, and that's exactly the regime that the Ninth Circuit decision restores in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.944" offset="8042812">At the end of the district court proceedings, essentially you had a case that was half in Federal court with the issue that petitioners were appealing being left essentially to the tribal courts, and half in Federal court with the issue that the respondents did not appeal being part of the Federal decision-making.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.368" offset="8128494">So in the end it seems to me that, confronted with a split case, the Ninth Circuit did what would make the most sense, assuming it had the power to do it, which is to say, let's let the tribal courts decide both of these issues in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.848" offset="8186381">And one particular point I think that bears on that is that if, in fact, the district court is incorrect that tribal courts lack power over Price-Anderson actions, then, in fact, the other question, the question that petitioners were asking the Ninth Circuit to consider, is irrelevant to jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.093" offset="8267361">It doesn't make any difference whether this is a public liability action or not for purposes of determining tribal court jurisdiction, if, in fact, tribal courts have a jurisdiction, whether it is or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2043.921" offset="8322636">That is to say, what possible reason could Congress have if... suppose a nuclear power plant leaks, you know, so it's quite clearly the kind of thing that Price Anderson is concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.290" offset="8364119">The nuclear power plant leaks, and now every State action, of which there would be thousands, the defendants can remove to Federal court immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.027" offset="8403093">That's absolutely clear Congress wants that to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.652" offset="8413647">Now, what reason could Congress have for saying in such a case that although we got all these actions in Federal court and out of State court, nonetheless we want them to proliferate over in the tribal courts?</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.068" offset="8459309">I mean, I grant you, somebody could logically say that, but what practical reason or other reason would there be for that?</text>

            <text syncTime="2858.888" offset="11582509">I think the answer to that, Justice Goldburg, goes back to the basic idea why the exhaustion doctrine exists at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2879.601" offset="11665369">I think it is sufficient to justify the tribal exhaustion doctrine under traditional principles of comity that the suit was originally filed in tribal court, and the tribal court has asserted jurisdiction over it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2908.762" offset="11782084">I'm not saying that those decisions necessarily foreclose any evolution, essentially, in the 1331 cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.327" offset="11820328">What I'm saying is that I think the proper application of the tribal exhaustion doctrine is essentially to leave matters affecting the jurisdiction of a tribal court to the tribal court in the first instance when there is a pending tribal court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.018" offset="11883021">And what is being asked in the 1331 proceeding is that a Federal court take the highly unusual step of declaring that another court lacks jurisdiction over the claims it's presently hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.847" offset="11930355">It seems to me that, unless that lack of jurisdiction in the tribal court is clear, then Federal courts are really overstepping the proper bounds of injunctive power under usual principles of comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.465" offset="11980824">Also, it does seem to me that one runs the risk of having just what you have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.190" offset="12007782">As Justice Kennedy pointed out earlier, you essentially have a case which then goes up to a court of appeals essentially in a mixed condition, because in our view the district court should not have decided that tribal jurisdiction is foreclosed over... under public liability actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.954" offset="12082806">We think under a proper demonstration of the principles of National Farmers, that question was also properly left to the tribal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3006.880" offset="12174548">That is a jurisdiction that should be sparingly exercised, but I think the usual principles that say, once a court acquires jurisdiction independently over a part of a case, it then has jurisdiction over the entire case, and the power to dispose of the entire case is essentially the controlling principle here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.323" offset="12260230">The decision in Morley is, I think, probably the biggest obstacle to that point, but I think there are a couple of responses to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.330" offset="12300354">First of all, if one looks at the cases cited in Morley, although Morley itself certainly talks in terms of power, a number of the cases talk in terms of waiver, or something amounting to a waiver, or a loss of the right to insist on the appeal, language which suggests really more about the loss of a litigant's right to insist upon a decision and less... goes less to the question of the power of the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3317.855" offset="13418394">I'll put it specifically so you have a chance to say it, but that the... you look at the Price-Anderson Act and it says, with respect to any public liability action resulting from a nuclear incident, Federal courts have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.744" offset="13470012">Then it defines a public liability action really to be any action where somebody is claimed to owe money to a member of the public arising out of a nuclear incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.472" offset="13512853">Then it defines nuclear incident to mean any occurrence that causes sickness or death or injury arising from the radioactive properties of nuclear material.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.120" offset="13563426">Well, QED.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.163" offset="13571681">What is there for them to decide if we send it back?</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.145" offset="13583593">What they're saying is, QED.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.038" offset="13591116">All the claims in this complaint are Price-Anderson claims, because they all allege injury arising... to a member of the public arising out of radioactive material.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.277" offset="13648063">End of the matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="3377.491" offset="13656945">I think there are two real problems... excuse me... with reading the language the way that that would, frankly, naturally seem to be read.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.177" offset="13687665">You wind up with two linguistic anomalies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.648" offset="13701562">First of all, you wind up with, under petitioner's reading, a public liability action against defendants, who are not liable for public liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.764" offset="13746074">The linchpin of a public liability action is that it asserts public liability, but it isn't asserting public liability against anybody who is responsible for public liability in this case.</text>
