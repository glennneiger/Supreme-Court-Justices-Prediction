            <text>We'll hear argument now in Number 97-1337, Minnesota v. the Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians.</text>
            <text>Mr. Kirwin.</text>

            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>This case is about two principles that this Court has emphasized repeatedly in recent years, upholding the traditional scope of sovereignty of the States, and upholding the plain language of treaties with the Indians.</text>
            <text>At issue here is an Indian privilege to hunt and fish in an area of Minnesota that the Chippewa Indians ceded to the Federal Government in an 1837 treaty.</text>
            <text>Under the treaty, this privilege of hunting, fishing, and gathering, was guaranteed to the Indians only during the pleasure of the President.</text>
            <text>That phrase is at the heart of this dispute.</text>
            <text>The State asserts that there are three independent events which terminated the temporary privilege under the 1837 treaty, an executive order in 1850, which expressly revoked the treaty privilege, Minnesota's admission to the Union in 1858 on an equal footing with the original States, and an 1855 treaty which revoked any and all rights the Indians had at that time in Minnesota but which relates to only one of the bands in this case.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Kirwin, may I ask you to clarify what was the nature of the right?</text>
            <text>It's a little confusing in the briefs.</text>
            <text>Is it a superior right to what any other person would have to hunt and fish, or just the same right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_l_kirwin">
            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>Your Honor, the lower courts held, based on this Court's decision in the cases from the Northwestern United States, that it's a superior right that it guarantees the bands the right to take an allocation of the fish and game that are available to hunt without complying with the regulations of the State that apply to other persons.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>In 1837, was there any difference, because as I understand it there weren't any regulations.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_l_kirwin">
            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>In 1837, Your Honor, there weren't any regulations, and there weren't any until Minnesota became a State in 1858 and enacted hunting and fishing laws.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>So that legally, if the revocation had occurred in 1838, all of the members of the Indian bands could have continued to do, so far as the law was concerned, exactly what they thought they had a right to do under the treaty, is that correct?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_l_kirwin">
            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>That would be true, Your Honor, as long as neither the Federal Government nor the territories that covered that area passed any hunting and fishing laws.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Right, but in fact there were none, as you said.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_l_kirwin">
            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>That's right.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>So if there had been a revocation... excuse me... they could have gone on doing it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_l_kirwin">
            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>That's correct, Your Honor, and we think that the principal effect of the privilege and the revocation of the privilege was something that was recognized by President Andrew Jackson in his 1829 State of the Union address, and he said that if the Indians were asked to voluntarily remove from the area but refused to do so, then they would have to understand that they would be subject to the laws of the State, and so as the lower courts interpreted this privilege, the effect of it is to make the Indians not subject to many of the laws of the States of Minnesota and Wisconsin.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But I thought it was conceded that the State can place some limits on the harvest that the Indians can take.</text>
            <text>Isn't that... that puzzled me.</text>
            <text>By what authority can the State impose some limitations?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_l_kirwin">
            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>Your Honor, what this Court has said in the cases coming from the Northwest United States, Puyallup II, Antoine, Passenger Fishing Vessel, is that the State can regulate in the interest of conservation, the lower courts have extended that to health and safety, but that the State's regulatory authority is limited.</text>
            <text>There are significant encroachments on the State's regulatory authority.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, what could the State do, in your view, under the cases from the Pacific Northwest in terms of regulation or limiting the season for taking fish and game, or the quantity?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_l_kirwin">
            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>Your Honor, it appears under the lower courts rulings in this case, based on this Court's earlier decisions, that the State would be very limited in regulating to limit hunting and fishing seasons, for example.</text>
            <text>If the bands were to insist on--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, it's very unclear to me what you think, under existing precedent, if we were to affirm, what do you think the State could do in terms of regulation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_l_kirwin">
            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>--If the bands insisted on taking more than half of the resource, the State probably could prevent that with the Federal court's assistance.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Why?</text>
            <text>Why so?</text>
            <text>I mean, if the treaty gives them hunting and fishing rights, I assume they can hunt and fish to their heart's content.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_l_kirwin">
            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>Your Honor, in the cases from the Northwestern United States, this Court seemed to recognize that the Indians had a right to a share of the hunting and fishing resource, but that non-Indians also had a right to a share, and so this Court said that 45 or 50 percent might be the maximum Indian share.</text>
            <text>The lower courts in this case seemed, although it's not entirely clear from their opinions, they seem to have adopted--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>In the Pacific Northwest cases some of them ended up with the district court kind of serving almost as a master, didn't they, in allocating various percentages?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_l_kirwin">
            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>--That's correct, Your Honor, and ruling on particular kinds of regulation, and the State's concern here is that under the lower court's decision, that we have the same situation already.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>What has been worked out in Wisconsin, where there's been a previous decision upholding the right of the tribes to hunt and fish, and yet the State has somehow worked out some kind of a... an agreement with the tribe.</text>
            <text>What sort of agreement has been worked out?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_l_kirwin">
            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>Your Honor, the ground rules, as I understand them in Wisconsin, are that the bands are entitled to take half of the available resource, and so the... and the State of Wisconsin then has been required to allow the bands to do that.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>Without regard to hunting seasons or times of day and so on.</text>
            <text>The State can make limited regulations for purposes of conserving or assuring the preservation of the species.</text>
            <text>The States can make limited regulations for purposes of public safety, but there is certainly a significant encroachment on the State's ability to regulate under this Court's decisions and as they've been applied by the lower court here.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>This applies only, of course, on public lands on which hunting and fishing are permitted.</text>
            <text>It doesn't extend to private--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_l_kirwin">
            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>That's correct, Your Honor, yes, and the State asserts that this hunting and fishing privilege was terminated by three events, but the most basic of these, we think, was the President's executive order in 1850 expressly terminating the privilege.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>--The parties stay away from any property analogies.</text>
            <text>They don't say that this is an easement, or a profit, and I assume that's because it's not helpful.</text>
            <text>This is a... and this is a discrete area of the law.</text>
            <text>This is--</text>

          <turn speaker="john_l_kirwin">
            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>Your Honor, there was some discussion in the lower courts, particularly by the landowners, as to what the particular nature of the right might be.</text>
            <text>As far as the State is concerned, it probably is unique.</text>
            <text>What's unique about it is that it's something that comes from the Indian title to the land, and so it's part of the Indian title which includes an element of sovereignty or quasi-sovereignty, but what this Court made clear in the Winans case is that when Indians cede land to the Federal Government, but there's a reserved hunting and fishing right, that what's reserved is a part of, a remnant of that original interest that the Indians had in the land.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>--I don't--</text>
            <text>--But it's a sovereign interest and not a property interest that we're talking about, or not a sovereign interest, depending on how you come out.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_l_kirwin">
            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>Well, it's... Your Honor, I think the important point is, it's part of the Indians' original Indian title.</text>
            <text>It may be the sovereignty part of that rather than some other part of it, but nonetheless it certainly is--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, is there any authority from this Court that the right to hunt and fish is an interest in real property?</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>That's such an odd concept, because if a non-Indian person wanted to hunt or fish, one wouldn't talk about that in terms of a property interest, would they?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_l_kirwin">
            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>--Right, and I think, Your Honor, that it's different when you're dealing with Indian cessions of property, as the Court recognized in Winans, as the Court recognized in the Klamath case, where the Court said that where the Indians ceded all right, title, and interest to the land, the Court said, undoubtedly any special rights they had to hunt and fish went along with that, because what it is is a sovereign selling not only the land, but their special rights in the land, and to regulate the land, and to use it as they see fit.</text>
            <text>They're conveying all of that.</text>
            <text>And what the Court said in Winans is that where you have a conveyance of the land, that a reservation of the right... and the Court was very emphatic about this.</text>
            <text>The Court said that the hunting and fishing right isn't a grant to the Indians, but the Indians are granting the land to the Government, or conveying the land to the Government and preserving something.</text>
            <text>They're preserving a remnant of what they have, and the total--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Let me ask you a couple of things that I'm curious about.</text>
            <text>The petition... the respondents here got an award from the Indian Claims Commission--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_l_kirwin">
            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>--That's right, Your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>--in 1970.</text>
            <text>Did that have any effect on the right to fish and hunt and gather wild rice?</text>
            <text>Did the claim encompass any of that when they were compensated?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_l_kirwin">
            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>Your Honor, in their final amended petition or complaint before the Indian Claims Commission the Indians had not mentioned hunting and fishing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>It was not mentioned.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_l_kirwin">
            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>Right.</text>
            <text>They did mention it at earlier stages and, in fact, before the court of claims, which was the beginning of that process for them, they specifically asserted that the privilege under the treaty was temporary, and that the Federal Government had ended it.</text>
            <text>Now, they were not making that claim at the end of the ICC proceeding, but I think an important thing about the ICC proceeding is that the band's experts proposed a value for the land based on its highest and most valuable uses, and the ICC awarded the band an award of an additional $9 million, about ten times as much as the original payment, to compensate them for the entirety of the land according to its highest, most valuable uses.</text>
            <text>And this Court recognized in the Klamath case that where an Indian band or tribe receives full compensation without any deduction for hunting and fishing rights, then presumptively that compensation includes the hunting and fishing rights, too, that if there had been reserved hunting and fishing rights, there should have been a deduction for them, because the Indians were paid as... in Klamath as though they were conveying all their Indian title to the land, which included hunting and fishing rights.</text>

            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>--All of the bands.</text>
            <text>One other question.</text>
            <text>It was odd that there were subsequent treaties, one in 1854 and one in 1855, and they were different.</text>
            <text>The United States revoked treaty rights for the Mille Lacs Band in 1855 treaty, but it didn't do so with the other bands in the 1854 treaty.</text>
            <text>Is there any explanation for that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_l_kirwin">
            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>We don't know the explanation of that for sure.</text>
            <text>I think the most likely explanation is that they were negotiated by different people.</text>
            <text>The 1854 treaty was negotiated by an Indian agent out in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text>The 1855 treaty was negotiated by Commissioner Manypenny himself, and he had the Indians... the Indian chiefs brought to Washington to negotiate with him, and when you look at the 1854 treaty, as you point out there was actually a grant of some hunting and... a reservation of some hunting and fishing rights in quite a remote area of Minnesota.</text>
            <text>The whole approach of the treaty next year was different, in 1855.</text>
            <text>Not only did it not reserve hunting and fishing rights in the area ceded in that treaty, but there was a catch-all provision under which the Indians ceded any and all right, title, and interest of whatsoever nature they may be, a sort of--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>Yes.</text>
            <text>Yes, and as this Court recognized in the Klamath case that the ordinary construction of meaning, or of language like that is to convey special hunting and fishing rights.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, but the trouble is, the... I mean, we've got to judge ordinary construction in terms of this treaty, and one of the problems that we have, it seems to me, in seeing it your way, is just as was pointed out earlier, at the time in question anyone could have engaged in this sort of hunting and fishing.</text>
            <text>I could have... you know, my ancestors could have wandered onto the land and done it.</text>
            <text>They never had any interest in the land.</text>
            <text>So it seems to me you've got at least a burden to show that there was an understanding that hunting and fishing rights were thought to be rights in the land, as opposed to rights which any member of the public, without any history of property ownership, could have exercised, and I think that's where I have difficulty in seeing how you make your argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>Your Honor, I agree that there's a burden, but I think the burden goes the other way.</text>
            <text>As this Court recognized in Klamath, when you're dealing with Indian relinquishment of rights and selling of land, the context is different, and the understanding is that when Indians sell all their right, title, and interest in and to land, that unlike a private landowner, the Indians are selling any special hunting and fishing rights they had.</text>
            <text>And in the Klamath case and in the Yankton case, this Court talked about the almost insurmountable presumption that arises from such plain language.</text>
            <text>We agree that there's a burden, but we think the burden is on the other side to show that the treaty meant something other than what it seemed to say on its face.</text>

            <text>--there's no question that the Indians retained that.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Can I ask you a question before... I'd like to know what your response is to the Solicitor General's argument on what I think is the main point.</text>
            <text>You say that as President Taylor revoked the hunting and fishing and gathering rights and also told them to remove, and I take it you concede that the part that says remove is unlawful.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>--Your Honor, we have not argued this in our brief, but we don't concede--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, anyway, you're not contesting it, and in that case the question is severability, and I just want to know... I mean, as a matter of common sense it's pretty hard to think that President Taylor, had he known that they weren't going to remove, would have wanted to have them sit there and starve.</text>
            <text>I mean, there's no evidence of that, is there, that anybody would want them to stay on their land and starve, nor is there any evidence that they would have used this to try to evict them, since the way to try to evict them was to get them to go take their annuity 1,000 miles away, and that didn't work, so how would the other have worked?</text>
            <text>And then the SG's brief is just filled with instances where the Government went and gave them rifles and fishing gear and I guess maybe gathering equipment and all kinds of stuff all the time, so when I read that, I thought, well, gee, there's 100 years of everybody thinking that they could fish and hunt and gather, and what's the evidence that this would have been... that Zachary Taylor would have wanted the one to stay even though the other fell?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_l_kirwin">
            <label>Mr. John L. Kirwin</label>
            <text>--Your Honor, I'd like to make a quick, two-part response to that.</text>
            <text>One is that President Taylor's purpose in doing that would very likely have been what President Jackson said in 1829 when he was talking about removal, and he said that the Indians must understand that if they don't remove, they'll be subject to the laws of the States, and Wisconsin had just become a State in 1848, Minnesota had just become a Territory and was soon to become a State, and so the President could very well have wanted to clear the decks to allow those States to engage in their normal State regulation.</text>
            <text>And the second point is that, yes, the Federal Government did allow the Indians to hunt on the land after this time.</text>
            <text>The Federal Government provided them equipment and so on to do this, but that doesn't indicate whether they were intended to be hunting pursuant to State law or not pursuant to State law and, in fact, the Federal Government provided them with the same assistance in hunting and fishing in the 1855 treaty area, where they had no reserved hunting and fishing right, and so the fact that the Federal Government supported them in that simply is no indication one way or the other on that point.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>It may be an indication that the Federal Government understood that the 1855 treaty did not convey any hunting and fishing rights.</text>

          <heading>Argument of Randy V. Thompson</heading>
          <turn speaker="randy_v_thompson">
            <label>Mr. Randy V. Thompson</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>I'd like to address two issues, first, the President's decision under the 1850 order and why it is not reviewable and, secondly, why the Indian Claims Commission operates as a jurisdictional bar in this case.</text>
            <text>But briefly, before I begin, Justice Kennedy and Justice O'Connor asked questions about whether or not these were property interests, these hunting and fishing privileges.</text>
            <text>This Court made that clear, I believe, in Klamath, and it had made it clear in Kennedy v. Becker, which Klamath refers to, that a privilege to hunt and fish is subject to State regulation, and it is in the nature of a profit of prendre.</text>
            <text>We, of course, have--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Of what?</text>
            <text>Of profit of prendre?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="randy_v_thompson">
            <label>Mr. Randy V. Thompson</label>
            <text>--I'm sorry.</text>
            <text>A profit of prendre.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But the question is whether it would have been understood by the parties to this treaty at the time as an interest in land.</text>
            <text>I mean, we're construing treaty language, and one of the difficulties, I think, that you have in maintaining your position is, as we said earlier, that the interest was an interest which could be exercised ad lib, as it were, by anybody, given the state of regulation at that time.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="randy_v_thompson">
            <label>Mr. Randy V. Thompson</label>
            <text>I believe that the evidence demonstrates that when the treaties were signed, because they were land cession treaties, the language used was the typical language of real estate conveyance.</text>
            <text>If you look at the language of this treaty, during the pleasure of the President, and the explanation in the treaty journal that they will be allowed and permitted during the President's pleasure to hunt and fish upon the lands, that's precisely the language of a real estate license.</text>
            <text>I under--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, may I just ask you... I don't want to cut you off, but that raises another point that I want you to address.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="randy_v_thompson">
            <label>Mr. Randy V. Thompson</label>
            <text>--Sure.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>There was a considerable amount of material in the briefs on the other side to the effect that it is highly unlikely, almost to the point of impossible, that the Indian parties to the treaty understood the phrase, at the President's pleasure, in the way that we would understand it as property lawyers today.</text>
            <text>And specifically there was a fair amount of information to the effect that the Indian parties to the treaties specifically assumed that they would enjoy these hunting and fishing rights as of right for a considerable period of time, certainly beyond the point of the claimed revocation, so in your answer, would you address that, too?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="randy_v_thompson">
            <label>Mr. Randy V. Thompson</label>
            <text>Certainly, and let me address that first.</text>
            <text>I think that the language of the treaty journal demonstrates that during the pleasure of the President was, in fact, explained to the Indians.</text>
            <text>It was referenced twice in the treaty journal, and it was explained that they would be allowed and permitted during his pleasure to hunt and fish upon the land, and it would probably be many years before the Great Father would want all of these lands for his white Children.</text>
            <text>Now, that's not a guarantee that it would be many years, but it was an indication that neither party was certain as to how quickly settlement pressures were going to occur.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But of course, the... I suppose the intransigence of the tribes at the time the removal order came down, which ultimately the United States caved in to, is probably some indication of what they thought the period of time was that they were agreeing to.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="randy_v_thompson">
            <label>Mr. Randy V. Thompson</label>
            <text>Well, I'm not certain that that's the case, because we simply don't know what the bands were thinking in 1837, other than what we have in the treaty.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, we usually interpret treaties by their language, don't we, I mean, just reading the language?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="randy_v_thompson">
            <label>Mr. Randy V. Thompson</label>
            <text>That's right.</text>
            <text>That's right, Mr. Chief Justice, and the plain language we believe controls here, and that the... there is no ambiguity, and there was no finding of ambiguity in the language, during the pleasure of the President.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, there's at least this ambiguity, does during the pleasure of the President mean he only gets one shot at canceling it, or does it mean whenever the President wants you to hunt and fish you may, and whenever he doesn't, you may not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="randy_v_thompson">
            <label>Mr. Randy V. Thompson</label>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>In other words, was the... assuming that it was severable, was the presidential termination of the hunting and fishing rights irrevocable, or could later Presidents reinstitute the hunting and fishing rights?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="randy_v_thompson">
            <label>Mr. Randy V. Thompson</label>
            <text>--Well, we submit that while Taylor probably could have suspended, given the power he had over this privilege, he did not do so.</text>
            <text>He revoked it.</text>
            <text>Once he revoked it, we do not believe that the executive branch had any authority to reinstate that privilege.</text>
            <text>Certainly Congress could have, but the executive branch did not.</text>
            <text>There's nothing in the treaty to suggest it.</text>
            <text>I would refer the Court, for example, to the language of the Federal Convention in which the term maladministration was proposed as a term for, under the impeachment article, and James Madison responded that such a term would be tenure during the pleasure of the Senate.</text>
            <text>I don't think James Madison was referring to the fact that they could put the President in and out of office.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But we do have also some notion that we read these treaties in the light of knowing that the party on the other side couldn't even speak the same language, so the interpretation is more favorable than if these were two sophisticated parties, meaning with equal language facility, sophistication, isn't that so?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="randy_v_thompson">
            <label>Mr. Randy V. Thompson</label>
            <text>Well, it is true, and I think this Court addressed it specifically in Klamath, in which the Court indicated that legal ambiguities are resolved in favor of the Indians, and I believe they cited DeCoteau for that proposition.</text>
            <text>But the Court cannot ignore plain language, viewed in the historical context and given the fair appraisal, that runs counter to the band's claims.</text>

            <text>--Okay.</text>
            <text>The... we believe that the Indian Claims Commission Act operates as a jurisdictional bar because it really has two provisions that are operable here.</text>
            <text>You have section 12 that says, any claim against the United States that was pending and could have been brought as of August 1946 had to be brought within 5 years or it was barred.</text>
            <text>Under section 22, if a claim was brought and paid, it is also barred, as this Court decided in the United States v. Dann.</text>
            <text>It really doesn't matter for the analysis, in our view, whether the claim was brought and paid or not.</text>
            <text>Under either analysis, it is barred.</text>
            <text>Now, the bands will argue that this is not a claim against the United States, so the ICC doesn't operate as a bar.</text>
            <text>But the Solicitor General in the Oglala case petitioned, when they opposed grant of petition of cert to this Court, argued that the bar against the State of... the United States also operated as a bar in that case against the claim against South Dakota, which involves the Black Hills claim.</text>
            <text>We believe that it was part of the Indian Claims Commission Act, claim made by this bands in docket 18(c).</text>
            <text>It was part of the original pleadings.</text>
            <text>The pleadings were amended to ask for the highest and best use, instead of asking for specific items, but that merely reflects what the ICC was doing, giving a single award based on the highest and best use.</text>
            <text>Without an offset, as this Court has indicated in Klamath, that operates as a bar, so the petition of the landowners in this case is under the Indian Claims Commission Act.</text>
            <text>This is a case that certainly could have been brought against the United States of America--</text>

            <label>Mr. Marc D. Slonim</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>I'd like to take just a moment to explain what this case is about from the Chippewa's perspective, and then turn to the 1850 order and the equal footing issues.</text>
            <text>This case involves core Indian interests.</text>
            <text>For centuries, the Chippewa have hunted, fished, and gathered wild foods.</text>
            <text>These activities still put food on their tables.</text>
            <text>They help pay for life's necessities, and they are in a very real sense central to the culture and identity of the Chippewa.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, I suppose if State regulation were applicable, they would be entitled to hunt and fish, as anyone else would, with a hunting and fishing license.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="marc_d_slonim">
            <label>Mr. Marc D. Slonim</label>
            <text>That is correct, Your Honor, but they could not use fish and game in the way they use it in their culture.</text>
            <text>Let me give you two examples.</text>
            <text>One of the most important fishing activities for the Chippewa is spring spear fishing.</text>
            <text>It's something their ancestors have done for generations.</text>
            <text>They still do today.</text>
            <text>It is illegal under State law in both Wisconsin and Minnesota to spear fish in the spring.</text>
            <text>In each of these reservation communities, there are families that are providers.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">

            <label>Mr. Marc D. Slonim</label>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And that means in the spring season?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="marc_d_slonim">
            <label>Mr. Marc D. Slonim</label>
            <text>In the springtime.</text>
            <text>As the ice moves out on these northern lakes, they go out in canoes and they use spears and lights to take fish.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">

            <label>Mr. Marc D. Slonim</label>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>--Mr. Slonim, have they been, say, spear-fishing in the spring over a long, long period of time without being subject to State regulation?</text>
            <text>I mean, if that was the case, why was this action brought?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Marc D. Slonim</label>
            <text>They have to sneak out... before these rights were reaffirmed by the courts, they would have to sneak out and try to do it without getting caught.</text>
            <text>That was the only way they could do it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>So it was never established one way or the other as to whether they had these rights as between, say, the State of Minnesota and the tribes.</text>
            <text>The tribes said they did, and the State of Minnesota said they didn't.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Marc D. Slonim</label>
            <text>Not until this case was decided.</text>
            <text>The other example I was going to give Your Honor was, in each of these communities there are people that are providers.</text>
            <text>They go out and they get fish and game and they supply it to elders and others who are incapable of getting it themselves.</text>
            <text>State bag limits and State seasons prevent them from pursuing those activities, from providing fish and game at funerals which occur out of season, or for... as part of ceremonies in connection with births or other life cycle events that happen to take place in the wrong season.</text>
            <text>They cannot preserve these traditions if they are subject to State law, and that's why we're here.</text>
            <text>Turning to the 1850 order, I wanted to provide our answer to Justice Ginsburg's question about what the Indians were told and what they understood at the time the 1850 order was issued.</text>
            <text>What the record shows is that they were told that the order was an order to remove.</text>
            <text>They were not told that the order was an order to stop hunting and fishing, or would have any effect on hunting and fishing.</text>
            <text>They were told they had to move.</text>
            <text>In 1855--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">

            <label>Mr. Marc D. Slonim</label>
            <text>--There was evidence that a circular was prepared which had a copy of the order, and that was sent to the bands in Wisconsin, which were... who are the targets of the removal effort.</text>
            <text>It was not sent, for example, to the Mille Lacs Band, which was never a target of the removal effort, but that's what... there was evidence to that effect.</text>
            <text>In 1855, the Territorial Governor of Minnesota, who was the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, he was the highest Federal official responsible for implementing Federal Indian law in the Territory of Minnesota, wrote a letter and said that the Indians had no interest on these lands except hunting and fishing.</text>
            <text>He specifically recognized, 5 years after this order was issued, that they had hunting and fishing rights under the 1837 treaty.</text>
            <text>There was an incident up at Mille Lacs Lake.</text>
            <text>He sent an investigator there, and the investigator reported that the lumbermen and all of the Chippewa believed that they still had hunting and fishing rights under the 1837 treaty.</text>

            <text>I'd like to talk about that, because the State's interpretation of the 1837 treaty and the President's authority under that treaty we think is really quite remarkable.</text>
            <text>Under the State's interpretation, the President could revoke these rights at any time.</text>
            <text>He could revoke them, according to the State, as part of an unauthorized removal attempt, which led to hundreds of Chippewa deaths.</text>
            <text>He could revoke them at a time, as the district court found, when the land wasn't needed for settlement and there was no other interest of the United States served by the revocation.</text>
            <text>But what he couldn't do, according to the State, is, upon learning of the consequences of the removal order, he couldn't allow the Indians to remain and to hunt and fish during his pleasure.</text>
            <text>In other words, he couldn't do the one thing the treaty says he could do, and that doesn't make any sense.</text>

            <text>Although the 1850 order stated that the Chippewa were required to remove from the ceded territory and could no longer exercise their usufructuary privilege there, that order never took effect.</text>

            <text>I thought that was one argument that... and it would be perverse to say, they can stay here, but they're going to starve to death.</text>
            <text>We've heard now, everybody seems to agree that they wouldn't be prohibited from engaging in any of these activities, they just have to do them like everyone else, so why did you in the brief twice, I noticed, you said, that would be taking away their sustenance, but that's wrong, isn't it?</text>
