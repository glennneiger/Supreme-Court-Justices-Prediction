            <text syncTime="81.535" offset="471454">It places a constant stress on his cardiovascular system and on major organs such as his heart, his kidneys, and his eyes.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.724" offset="504159">There's no dispute in this case that without medication Vaughn Murphy's hypertension limits virtually all of his life activities, and substantially so.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.263" offset="546373">The fundamental question in this case is whether the Americans With Disabilities Act applies to Vaughn Murphy at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.185" offset="574063">With all due respect to the lower courts, the ADA applies to Vaughn Murphy for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.439" offset="599036">First, he has an actual disability, because his hypertension substantially limits his major life activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.160" offset="629965">Second, UPS regarded him as disabled when it fired him.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.397" offset="650863">Satisfying either of those two statutory alternatives establishes only that the ADA applies to Vaughn Murphy and that his suit against UPS should proceed to the additional inquiries that the statute contemplates.</text>
