            <text syncTime="37.028" offset="291889">By statute in Iowa, police are authorized to search any motor vehicle in which the driver receives a traffic citation.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.954" offset="335566">The question presented here is whether Iowa's search incident citation statute shall be adopted by this Court as a new category of per se reasonable searches.</text>

            <text syncTime="65.285" offset="404947">The statute says, I believe, the issuance of a citation in lieu of arrest or in lieu of continued custody does not affect the officer's authority to conduct an otherwise lawful search.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.497" offset="469731">So, I took it that the issue was whether this was a lawful search, not whether the statute said there can be a full-blown search.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.085" offset="508078">I thought it left it to the subsequent determination of whether the search was lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.891" offset="531380">Now, in this case, the Iowa court said that a full search was lawful but, in the course of that, seemed to rely, at least in part, on Federal law under the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="153.437" offset="757496">So, I guess what we have to decide is whether under the Federal Constitution that's correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="161.454" offset="789574">In March of 1996, Mr. Knowles was pulled over for speeding in Newton, Iowa.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.692" offset="886540">Mr. Rosenberg, could you just back up for a minute because in your answer to Justice O'Connor, you said something that I didn't understand you had challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.628" offset="918305">That is, I didn't understand that you had contested the authority to make a full custodial arrest for speeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.982" offset="947667">You had only contested that if they don't and they merely give him a citation, then they can't search.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.487" offset="973685">But I hadn't realized that you had raised the question that Justice Stewart left over in the Gustafson case, which was whether you could have constitutionally a full arrest for a traffic violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.797" offset="1026975">Where did you raise that question?</text>

            <text syncTime="229.662" offset="1062397">Well, then your answer to Justice O'Connor was not right because she asked you if you were contesting the authority to make a full custodial arrest on the basis of a traffic violation, and you said you were.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.812" offset="1123001">But I understood that you were not, that you were making a more limited challenge, that is, if... assuming they could make a full custodial arrest, they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.389" offset="1161349">All they did was issue a citation.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.839" offset="1171171">Having done just a citation, they cannot engage in... in a full search.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.268" offset="1216833">The statute says otherwise lawful search.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.280" offset="1228849">The Iowa Supreme Court held that the search was lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.960" offset="1239611">At no stage in the proceeding from the district court to the Iowa Supreme Court to this Court have we contested the validity of the arrest... excuse me... the stop in this case or the authority to arrest in the circumstances of a traffic citation.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="298.058" offset="1336056">So, all that we're talking about is if they don't exercise that authority, authority you're not challenging, and merely issue a citation, can they nonetheless go ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.057" offset="1380046">So, that's what we're talking about.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul Rosenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="310.947" offset="1387569">--That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.979" offset="1391644">The officer testified that he had no suspicion that Mr. Knowles was carrying contraband or a weapon or that he had such items concealed on his person or in his car.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.148" offset="1452353">At this point, being satisfied, he issued the citation to Mr. Knowles, handed it to him, and Mr. Knowles signed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.864" offset="1487252">At this point, the officer radioed for backup and searched Mr. Knowles' person and his automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.222" offset="1528630">He found a small quantity of marijuana and what the officer called a pot pipe.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.674" offset="1546498">At the suppression hearing, the officer testified that he had no justification and no search... excuse me... no consent to conduct a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.283" offset="1588921">He was relying entirely on Iowa's search incident to citation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.705" offset="1602609">The Supreme Court, in deciding Mr. Knowles' appeal, essentially held that the search incident to arrest doctrine, which in United States v. Robinson was held to be a per se reasonable search, that this doctrine was going to be extended by the State of Iowa by virtue of the statute to situations in which a citation was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.001" offset="1699785">The fundamental premise of the Iowa Supreme Court's decision was that the search incident to arrest doctrine does not require a custodial arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.749" offset="1746805">It merely requires grounds for arrest or cause for arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.150" offset="1760389">This premise is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.081" offset="1772091">The search incident to arrest doctrine has historical legitimacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.846" offset="1799154">It existed at the common law in this country and in England, and it was always thought to involve search incident to arrest as a necessary and, it was assumed, reasonable search.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.047" offset="1868013">There was no comparable historical roots or historical legitimacy for a search incident to a citation or a search incident to any other means by which a criminal prosecution would be commenced outside of an arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3101.462" offset="12549587">So, the reason we... the reason we are proposing a rule that would require initiation of a prosecution is that it's our strong belief that when a prosecution is initiated, whether that's by custodial arrest or by issuance of a citation, those... the same concerns with officer safety and preservation of error arise.</text>

            <text syncTime="3378.537" offset="13657910">I would just like to make a few comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.887" offset="13675360">Ms. Chambers mentioned that the officer suspected Mr. Knowles had drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.703" offset="13698557">The officer, although he may have suspected, testified at the suppression hearing that he had no cause, no suspicion, that Mr. Knowles had any drugs on him on this occasion, and that is in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.063" offset="13756026">The second response I'd like to make regarding the enforcement of this statute, although the statute was passed in 1983, it wasn't until about 1990 or thereafter that the Iowa Supreme Court gave it its construction and anybody had any idea that this was what it meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.556" offset="13838051">And it hasn't been enforced much because a lot of county attorneys have been advising the police officers not to rely on this as their sole basis for a search pending their belief in the... that it may be overturned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.295" offset="13900954">And finally, in response to Justice Ginsburg's question about the citizens of Iowa not putting up with this, over 400,000 citizens in Iowa a year get traffic tickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.674" offset="13950482">If this policy were uniformly and nondiscriminatorily enforced, it... the right to arrest would be ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.391" offset="13989352">The legislature would end it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.890" offset="13995308">I have confidence in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.012" offset="13999801">This policy can only be enforced... the statute can only be enforced selectively, otherwise it would politically not be stood for by the citizens of Iowa, and that in fact is one of the dangers of a statute like this.</text>
