            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="85728">The second case, another ADA case, is Murphy versus United Parcel Service, No. 97-1992.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.758" offset="128673">This case comes here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.489" offset="147586">The respondent, United Parcel Service, dismissed the petitioner Vaughn Murphy from his job as a mechanic because of his hypertension.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.220" offset="182590">The petitioner filed suit under Title I of the ADA in Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.218" offset="202548">The District Court granted summary judgment to the respondent and the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.207" offset="226476">It held that the petitioner's hypertension is not a disability, because he functions normally when he is medicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.405" offset="255315">The Court also held the petitioner is not regarded as disabled under the ADA.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.564" offset="275899">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.531" offset="291782">The first question is whether the determination of petitioner's disability is made with reference to the mitigating measures he employs.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.660" offset="324278">We have answered that question in the Sutton case just announced in the affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.105" offset="346117">Given that holding the result in this case is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.530" offset="359805">The Court of Appeals concluded that when medicated petitioner's hypertension does not substantially limit him in any major life activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.264" offset="394704">Petitioner did not seek certiorari on whether that conclusion was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.433" offset="415393">So, we conclude the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the grant of summary judgment in respondent's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.098" offset="442038">Petitioner also argues that he was regarded as disabled by respondent because of his hypertension.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.643" offset="468265">To support that claim he points to testimony from respondent's Resource Manager that respondent fired petitioner due to his hypertension, which he claims evidences respondent's belief that the hypertension and consequent inability to obtain certification from the Department of Transportation to drive commercial motor vehicles substantially limits his ability to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.538" offset="563873">As we held in Sutton a person is regarded as disabled within the meaning of the ADA, if a covered entity mistakenly believes that person's actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.675" offset="624373">Assuming arguendo, that unchallenged regulations issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission are correct, to be regarded as substantially limited in the major life activity of working, one must be regarded as precluded from a class of jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.551" offset="699919">Here the evidence that petitioner is regarded as unable to meet the Department of Transportation regulations is not sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he is regarded as unable to perform a class of jobs utilizing his skills.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.619" offset="764180">There is no evidence that petitioner is unable to perform mechanics jobs that do not call for driving a commercial vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.742" offset="796677">We conclude that petitioner has failed to show he is regarded as disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.198" offset="814440">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Breyer has joined.</text>
