            <text syncTime="24.315" offset="229150">There are three reasons why the failure to warn of appellate rights is a structural error which justifies relief as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.044" offset="264049">First, there is no substitute for a warning that comes directly from the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.228" offset="284843">Second, there is no way to correct the error on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.179" offset="304591">And third, a judicial warning has been deemed necessary both by this Court and by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.405" offset="333535">Turning to the first point, there is no substitute for a--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="54.613" offset="350358">You... you state these three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.182" offset="356627">I think Fulminante was where we talked... talked about structural error and what it took.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.808" offset="375122">Those don't... the reasons you cite don't come out of that opinion, do they?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_i_siegel" startTime="65.099" stopTime="128.545">
            <label>Mr. Daniel I. Siegel</label>
            <text syncTime="65.099" offset="392363">--This Court has never dealt with a structural error regarding access to an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.724" offset="410857">All the structural errors discussed by this Court have been trial errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.901" offset="423501">But I'd like to analogize this case to a structural error to explain why, using the terms of Hill, the failure to warn by a judge is a rudimentary demand of fair procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.963" offset="467804">Why is it there's no substitute for a warning that comes directly from the judge?</text>
            <text syncTime="88.505" offset="485985">Because rule 32 anticipates that when the defendant hears the warning that comes from the judge, he may at that moment on the record state at the sentencing hearing, yes, I want an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.410" offset="533528">And, indeed, the rule takes account of that possibility because the clerk is empowered to immediately file a notice of appeal on behalf of the defendant who spontaneously requests a notice of appeal after being warned by the district court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.625" offset="594446">For that mechanism to work, the warning has to come from the district court judge, and the failure to follow the rule we submit should, therefore, be akin to a structural error which is remedied as a matter of law.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="128.545" offset="646064">Is... is it true that... that if you are right, the same thing would be said for the rule 11 warnings in the plea colloquy, that... that failure to give any one of them or to give one of them accurately would also be structural error with the same result?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Daniel I. Siegel</label>
            <text syncTime="143.201" offset="704683">No, for a very important reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.514" offset="713982">When a defendant doesn't get his full rule 11 warnings, his attorney, assuming that there's a warning of the right to appeal and it's properly preserved... his attorney can raise those errors on direct appeal in the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.382" offset="769466">You can do that with virtually any error under the Rules of Criminal Procedure except this rule because if a defendant doesn't get the warning from the judge of his right to a direct appeal, that may effectively block the defendant's access to a direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.266" offset="836967">And that kind of an issue is a structural error which we submit should be--</text>

            <text syncTime="180.641" offset="854521">Well, it may or may not, and... and with other structural errors, you can't tell whether it does or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.626" offset="886390">But in this situation you can tell whether it did or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.447" offset="901750">If, in fact, he knew of his entitlement to an appeal, it did not.</text>

            <text syncTime="209.248" offset="968937">But we will never know, despite that warning, what would have happened if the judge had then warned the defendant of his appellate rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.818" offset="1011151">What we do know is that he understood that he had a right to appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="225.612" offset="1034348">--We have no indication from the record what his response would have been if the judge had told him.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.251" offset="1056918">For example, I can tell you from experience that the sentencing hearing is often the low point in the attorney/client relationship, and sometimes defendants do not trust their attorneys, especially if it is an appointed attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.254" offset="1108954">Sometimes a defendant can be confused and have in his mind the thought, oh, I'm going to get in trouble if I file an appeal or my cooperation won't work out if I file an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.428" offset="1141659">But if the defendant hears it from the district court judge on the record at the sentencing hearing, first he knows it's legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.146" offset="1172483">Second, the district court judge tells him under the rule, Mr. Defendant, you have a right to proceed in forma pauperis, to have a free appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.131" offset="1204457">The structure of the rule then anticipates that in response to what the judge says, the defendant may make a spontaneous statement on the record saying, yes, please file the appeal, and it happens immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.465" offset="1249806">Now, that's a little different... a lot different than the rest of the structure of the Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="345.513" offset="1513956">In... in the case of a defendant who pleads guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, and then waives his right to appeal, there's a colloquy on the record at the guilty plea hearing where the judge has to explain to the defendant what he's giving up in his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.359" offset="1569336">If there's a knowing and voluntary waiver, you can always make a knowing and voluntary waiver on the record of... of a procedural right, or any right indeed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2147.007" offset="8719990">I would briefly like to respond to some comments and questions, first a comment and question made by Justice Ginsburg regarding the amount of time that a defendant has to make up any error in meeting the 10-day limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.405" offset="8781535">The Government suggested that if the defendant doesn't meet the 10-day limit, that it can be corrected if he acts promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.919" offset="8811628">The defense counsel can ask the court to file a late notice of appeal if he shows good cause for doing it, but that's only a 30-day window of opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.966" offset="8851752">And what happens as a practical matter is that the defendant gets moved quickly by the United States marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.009" offset="8879964">Sometimes defense counsel doesn't get to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.897" offset="8891458">The defendant could be moved across State lines to a Federal penitentiary or can be in transit to a Federal penitentiary and not be able to get in touch with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.088" offset="8924268">So, that 30-day limit at the... at the maximum... and it's a 10-day limit with the 30 days for good cause... is a very short limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.873" offset="8955406">And I suggest to you that that might be one of the reasons why that the courts of appeals are adopting this per se rule even after the Timmreck case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.161" offset="8992604">In fact, in the Sanchez decision--</text>

            <text syncTime="2223.623" offset="9026459">None of the courts that have spoken about the per se rule discussed Timmreck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.792" offset="9043073">Now, Sanchez, Judge Buckley's decision for the District of Columbia Circuit, discussed the Tress opinion from the Seventh Circuit which adopted their view of the Timmreck standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.456" offset="9097721">So, you could say that they took account of it, but that court still stood by the... the per se rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.515" offset="9125933">And I think... I think it shows something about the severity of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.684" offset="9142652">We were able to find 31 cases since 1989 on Westlaw where a defendant had not been warned of his appellate rights and it was necessary to use a 2255 proceeding to get his direct appeal right back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.143" offset="9196464">I submit to you that that probably represents the tip of iceberg because normally the way you would expect a case like this to be resolved is that it comes down to the district court judge, he or she takes a look at the record and says, oh, we... we made a mistake at the sentencing hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.375" offset="9257381">Let's reinstate the defendant's appellate rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.892" offset="9267517">And now that there is a 1-year limitation on bringing this sort of petition, it seems to me that the interests of... of the courts, in addition to the defendants, in a fair rule is... is served by recognizing this is as an unusual structural type of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.663" offset="9330524">The... there was a question, I believe from Justice Ginsburg, regarding the warning about the clerk being able to file a notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.725" offset="9374828">Under the rule, the district court judge is under absolutely no obligation to tell a defendant that the clerk can immediately file a notice of appeal on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.582" offset="9418296">The way the rule is written it says that on the request of a defendant, the clerk can immediately file a notice of appeal on defendant's behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.377" offset="9453404">What that suggests to me is that the drafters of the rule anticipated that in response to warning from the judge, the defendant might spontaneously on the of the sentencing hearing ask for the reinstitution... ask for his direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.019" offset="9515994">And that, it seems to me, is a structural error that... that should be remedied as a matter of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2402.368" offset="9741378">The... the final point I wanted to make was reference to the Rodriquez case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.684" offset="9766665">And Rodriquez does have a different factual situation, and it is not on point for this case because of the additional facts that were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.374" offset="9809401">But I... I'd like to read to you just a couple of quotes from this Court's opinion at 395 United States Reports 331 and 332 where the Court observed first, it appears from the trial transcript in this case that the trial judge erroneously failed to advise petitioner of his right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.404" offset="9885574">Then the Court went on to make an argument, which is very similar to the argument I've made today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.523" offset="9906054">Had he known that the clerk would file a notice of appeal for him, he could easily have avoided the difficulties he has faced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.696" offset="9938655">At the very least, the trial judge should have inquired into the circumstances surrounding the attempt to make the in forma pauperis motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.262" offset="9964986">His failure... and we're talking about the district judge's failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.349" offset="9981287">His failure to do so effectively deprived petitioner of his right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.094" offset="10000304">And so I would submit that the rule, which recognizes the value of direct appeal, is a rule which would most... go furthest in honoring the defendant's right to choose that appeal under all circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.553" offset="10054116">Given the new limitation of 1 year, I would state that this rule creates an unusual structural error which should justify relief as a matter of law.</text>
