            <text syncTime="13.322" offset="203136">I want to speak to you first this morning about the jurisdiction issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.053" offset="218078">This case presents the question of how, not whether, but how the Tax Injunction Act applies to a tax collection case removed to Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.238" offset="254859">That, in turn, depends on whether the act is interpreted and applied as a broad jurisdictional barrier or simply as a limitation on a court's remedial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.596" offset="300312">We say that the... the act should be applied broadly to keep collection cases out of Federal court altogether because any lesser approach, any more narrow approach is just... is unworkable.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey M. Sewell</label>
            <text syncTime="79.163" offset="466555">I say that the Tax Injunction Act ought to apply to a tax collection case whether it's removed by a defendant by a taxpayer to Federal court or whether we had brought the case ourself in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.342" offset="511277">I think the Tax Injunction Act should bar... should keep these cases out of Federal court for a number of reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="103.635" offset="564462">The Tax Injunction Act is going to apply in some form or fashion if a case is removed, a collection case is removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.670" offset="588599">For... for example, if you go into Federal court in a tax collection case, the... it seems to me that that would allow the taxing authority, me in this case, the government, to use the Tax Injunction Act as both a sword and a shield to whipsaw a taxpayer.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="126.402" offset="655473">Well, what... what if this action had been brought in State court to collect taxes on the basis, say, of diversity of citizenship, and it was removed on that basis to the Federal court and there was no claim that the tax was unconstitutional?</text>
            <text syncTime="141.893" offset="717435">Maybe there was just a claim that it had been paid and the county said, no, it hasn't been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.004" offset="733944">You think the Tax Injunction Act would still apply?</text>

            <text syncTime="149.768" offset="748991">I believe... and I look to footnote 22 partially of the Grace Brethren Church opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="162.548" offset="800087">And... and when I went back and read that footnote, that footnote gives a very thorough history and analysis of the Tax Injunction Act, and it quotes the Senators and the Members of Congress that were responsible for enacting that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.054" offset="846167">And that footnote demonstrates... demonstrated to me conclusively that the purpose of the Tax Injunction Act, the central purpose, was to keep a Federal court from interfering in any manner in a State tax if there's an adequate State remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.603" offset="896322">That seems to me to be the... the clear purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="194.089" offset="926206">I think that the act... I wish that the act had... had said that, and I think that that's... you know, the act talks in terms of Federal courts not having the jurisdiction to... to enjoin, suspend or restrain a levy, assessment, or collection of a State tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.658" offset="976570">But, in effect, Your Honor, that's what happened here.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.124" offset="1026411">That's what it was.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.048" offset="1046055">It does, and the... I'm assuming that the purpose of the Tax Injunction Act, the overreaching purpose, is to prevent a Federal court from interfering with the collection or the administration of State tax, and I believe that's what the Court's Grace Brethren Church opinion, specifically footnote 22... that's exactly what it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.670" offset="1116586">Now, the... the way I see this, the... in this case, the Federal court did interfere with the collection, not only of our tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.436" offset="1155665">In this case... this case has stopped us from collecting the tax not only from the respondents, but from all the Federal judges in the Northern District.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.723" offset="1184818">It's exposed us to refund suits from the other judges who paid the tax other... other than these two respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.816" offset="1213135">It's resulted now in hundreds of Federal employees that work in Jefferson County refusing now to pay the tax, demanding explanations from us as to... as to why they have to pay if the judges don't have to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.323" offset="1259215">We're having now to respond to all of that, and it looks as though we may... we may have to--</text>

            <text syncTime="956.971" offset="3977830">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="962.223" offset="3998833">The Tax Injunction Act bars only anticipatory relief against State taxation in Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.590" offset="4028299">As Justice Stone said for this Court in Matthews v. Rodgers, which is cited in the legislative history of the Tax Injunction Act, although injunctions against State taxes should not be heard in Federal courts, Federal courts remain competent to decide questions of State law, and therefore can adjudicate collection and refund cases brought in Federal court so long as the essential elements of Federal jurisdiction are present.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.307" offset="4135087">It's our position that in this case, the essential elements of Federal jurisdiction are not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.020" offset="4157971">The only asserted basis for Federal jurisdiction is the Federal removal statute which does not apply here because the action of the judge in refusing to pay a tax on his private income is not an act taken under color of authority or pursuant to his duties as a Federal officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.850" offset="4225262">In the removal petition, respondents incorrectly stated that the tax was imposed on the act of performing their official duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.336" offset="4259221">That's not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.277" offset="4262983">The tax is imposed on, it's calculated on and assessed on their earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.962" offset="4281791">And this Court made clear in the O'Malley v. Woodrough case that the responsibility of Federal judges to pay taxes on their earnings derives from their private responsibilities as citizens and that they have the same responsibility as everyone else to share in the costs of paying for the benefits the government provides.</text>

            <text syncTime="1558.686" offset="6384648">This case was removed from the small claims division of the State court of Alabama by the respondents, two Article III Federal judges, and they alleged in their removal petition that the provision that the... both the Justice Kennedy and Justice Souter focused on about the unlawful... making it unlawful to engage in the occupation was tantamount to an imposition of a licensing requirement by the county upon Federal judges, which if carried out, would interfere with their Federal... carrying on the duties of Federal judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.121" offset="6534382">For purposes of removal, that is clearly a kind of Federal immunity defense, saying that the Constitution does not allow Jefferson County to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1614.203" offset="6606689">But significantly for removal I want to point out that at no time did Jefferson County in the district court or in the court of appeals suggest that removal was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.310" offset="6651097">And the rules... the statute requires that removal be objected to within 30 days or at least by the... if you allege that this is subject matter jurisdiction, which I'm not sure whether it is or not, that has to be done by the time of final judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2023.301" offset="8243104">The first thing I think we ought to recognize is that the Howard ordinance, insofar as it was before the Court, was only... the single footnote in note 2 in the Howard opinion quotes all of the ordinance that was actually in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.282" offset="8311022">I have gone and looked at the joint appendix, and there is nothing about exemptions in the Howard ordinance at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.588" offset="8340279">So that insofar as the Court was aware, and despite whatever may have been the actual state of the law at the time in terms of Louisville ordinance, there were no exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.335" offset="8387195">It now appears... and there has been several rounds of submissions on this, but it appears that the Louisville ordinance in effect at that time did have three exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.271" offset="8430976">One for domestic servants and the ordinance specifically says with respect to that that the... the exemption is because of the great costs of administration and difficulty of collection involved, domestic servants are excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.815" offset="8509135">Second, there is an exclusion for ministers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.428" offset="8523659">I don't want to get into another constitutional issue here today, but whatever that exclusion is and the questionable nature of it under First Amendment law, it was not a broad exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.297" offset="8571097">The other exclusion was for insurance companies who had other taxes, and there was another provision that said other businesses that had licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.861" offset="8609340">They didn't lose their licenses, but they still had to pay the tax under the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.044" offset="8630029">Stated another way, instead of the 140 exemptions across a broad range of issues that we have in this statutory scheme here, we had a very narrow set of exemptions, one for obvious administrative convenience reasons.</text>
