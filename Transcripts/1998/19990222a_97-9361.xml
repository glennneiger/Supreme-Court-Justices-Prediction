            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="146815">We'll hear argument now in No. 97-9361, Louis Jones v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.117" offset="179207">Mr. Crooks.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="timothy_crooks" startTime="9.086" stopTime="156.475">
            <label>Mr. Timothy Crooks</label>
            <text syncTime="9.086" offset="183073">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.239" offset="195716">This case arises on direct review of the first Federal death sentence imposed under the Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.895" offset="226332">Of critical importance in this case is the fact that the FDPA is a weighing statute in which jurors are required to weigh any statutory and non-statutory aggravating factors they find against any mitigating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.765" offset="285786">In this case, the court of appeals found that two of the four aggravating factors found by the jury were constitutionally invalid, but then held that that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.752" offset="333747">The court of appeals erred in concluding that this error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because if the two invalid aggravating circumstances are removed from the mix altogether in this weighing jurisdiction, this record simply cannot support a finding of harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.982" offset="406681">There are several reasons why this is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.035" offset="418906">First and foremost, there was an unusually powerful case in mitigation presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.018" offset="442835">This petitioner had a stellar military record, including 22 years of service in the United States Army as an Army Airborne Ranger.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.506" offset="476794">He served in two foreign conflicts and was decorated extensively.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.137" offset="491318">Furthermore, jurors in this case found that this petitioner, unlike many or most capital defendants, had no significant prior criminal record.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.463" offset="528621">Jurors also found that at the time of the offense the petitioner was laboring under severe mental or emotional disturbance, duress and stress, and impaired capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.671" offset="577417">And the jurors also took the extraordinary step of writing in as a mitigating factor the name, Sandy Lane, who was petitioner's ex-wife, thereby indicating they believed that the break-up of petitioner's marriage with Ms. Lane was in some degree a mitigating factor for this offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.733" offset="641679">It is also significant to look at the aggravating factors in this case which the jury did not find.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.638" offset="669264">The jury rejected fully three of the seven aggravating factors submitted by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.773" offset="693819">The jury did not find that this offense was committed as the result of substantial planning and premeditation.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.436" offset="720464">The jury did not find that the petitioner had created a grave risk of death to someone else besides the victim, and significantly the jury did not find that the petitioner would be a future danger.</text>

            <text syncTime="176.157" offset="851390">--I don't recall whether there was an express objection at trial on the grounds of duplication, but definitely there was an objection on the grounds of vagueness and overbreadth.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.673" offset="889424">Those are certainly the kinds of things that the prosecution could argue to the jury, and so this had the effect of focusing the jury's attention on a certain area.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.011" offset="938848">I would... I would think they would be too imprecise for eligibility, but... but this is the second stage, selection.</text>

            <text syncTime="206.597" offset="973120">This evidence is, indeed, admissible, Your Honor, as the Court pointed out in Payne, but the problem here is that this is a weighing jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.123" offset="1015230">And as the Court pointed out in Stringer, it's especially important that aggravating factors in a weighing jurisdiction be defined with some degree of precision.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.829" offset="1054100">And as the court of appeals correctly held, these factors were too vague and overbroad for use in a weighing jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.036" offset="1150857">Well, that's not the same thing as--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="timothy_crooks" startTime="251.537" stopTime="252.448">
            <label>Mr. Timothy Crooks</label>
            <text syncTime="251.537" offset="1152947">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.807" offset="1157963">So, we... we take the case on the assumption that they were... they were properly found to... to... to have been erroneously submitted to the jury.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="timothy_crooks" startTime="262.123" stopTime="264.697">
            <label>Mr. Timothy Crooks</label>
            <text syncTime="262.123" offset="1195266">That is certainly our position, Your Honor.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="264.697" stopTime="264.975">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="timothy_crooks" startTime="264.975" stopTime="322.073">
            <label>Mr. Timothy Crooks</label>
            <text syncTime="264.975" offset="1206655">As the court of appeals noted, these factors failed to distinguish this homicide from any other because every victim has a background and every victim has personal characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.863" offset="1254198">Therefore, by submitting these factors to the jury, the Government stacked the deck because the jury could not help but find these factors as they were worded, and once the jury found those factors, in this weighing jurisdiction it was required to weigh those factors on death's side of the scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.466" offset="1320653">As the court of appeals also noted, the mere use of terms like background and personal characteristics, without any further instruction, which there was not in this case, leave the jury with precisely the type of open-ended discretion this Court condemned in Furman v. Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.647" offset="1389303">In fact, the two invalid aggravating circumstances had they been removed, it cannot be said beyond a reasonable doubt that the result would have been the same in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="338.924" offset="1502466">The Fifth Circuit did correctly hold that they were both vague and overbroad and also duplicative because these factors are present in every homicide.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="348.581" stopTime="361.620">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="348.581" offset="1541127">But if... if... if you can... if Payne says you can put in victim evidence, in a sense that's true, every victim is going to have some sort of background, but isn't that exactly what Payne means?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="timothy_crooks" startTime="361.620" stopTime="385.664">
            <label>Mr. Timothy Crooks</label>
            <text syncTime="361.620" offset="1593267">Payne does mean that the jury may hear about evidence of the victim's characteristics and the effect on the survivors, but we're not arguing that Payne should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.917" offset="1638407">What we're arguing is that in a weighing jurisdiction, the factors must be defined with some degree of precision and they can't be vague and overbroad, and the jury's discretion must be channeled in an appropriate way for a weighing jurisdiction.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="385.664" offset="1689398">It would seem to me to be very difficult to design mitigating factors for submission to the jury that had no overlap.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.294" offset="1743942">I think that the Government could and, in fact, did in its brief, make an attempt to draft... redraft factors 3(B) and 3(C) in a fashion that would not be vague, overbroad, or duplicative, but the very extent to which the Government had to rewrite those factors in order to make them even attempt to pass constitutional muster highlights the problems with the factors which were actually submitted to this jury.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="422.279" stopTime="431.295">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="422.279" offset="1835893">Are you suggesting that perhaps the statutory aggravators are models because they certainly are discrete, the statutory aggravators?</text>

            <text syncTime="440.401" offset="1908408">So, if those are the models for what additional aggravators are, models of the extent of precision and clarity, I suppose that that would support the Eleventh Circuit's view.</text>

            <text syncTime="456.831" offset="1974133">The statutory aggravators certainly highlight the problem that are present in these non-statutory gravators because the statutory aggravators are worded a good bit more clearly and give much more direction to the jury than these factors 3(B) and 3(C) that the Government drafted.</text>

            <text syncTime="473.584" offset="2041111">That is, what I'm having trouble in my own mind... I take it it's constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.015" offset="2058874">It's perfectly okay to have a statutory aggravator as heinous... what is the words, you know... heinous, cruel, and depraved, which is a little vague, but I see the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.304" offset="2107984">But then why can't it be a statutory factor where you'd think of whether the... the victim is vulnerable?</text>
            <text syncTime="497.429" offset="2136510">And here what makes her vulnerable is her young age or... you know, they go through.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.732" offset="2157721">They say young age, slight stature, her background, and unfamiliarity with the region.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.668" offset="2181440">That seems more precise, not less precise.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.349" offset="2196173">I mean, I... I'm not taking a view one way or the other, but I'd like... just looking at it directly, I read those three words, heinous, depraved, et cetera, and then I compare it to the four rather precise things that have to do with the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.109" offset="2259181">Why is the... what's your argument that that's vaguer rather than more precise?</text>

            <label>Mr. Timothy Crooks</label>
            <text syncTime="535.834" offset="2290110">First, Your Honor, I think it's significant that the statutory aggravator, heinous, cruel, and depraved, doesn't just stop at the words heinous, cruel, and depraved, but goes on to tie that definition to torture and makes it more specific than just the words heinous, cruel, and depraved, which under this Court's decisions in Godfrey and Maynard v. Cartwright might, indeed, pose a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.949" offset="2374537">But what was problematic with the non-statutory aggravators is that whether or not it might have been permissible to tie the petitioner's culpability to the special vulnerability of the victim, the aggravators as submitted, the non-statutory aggravators, did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.890" offset="2446322">They simply required the jury to find her age, her background, her slight stature, and her youth and, once having found them, to treat that factor as aggravating, making the petitioner more death-worthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.169" offset="2495432">As written, the factor didn't require the jury to find that she was more vulnerable and therefore that he was more culpable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1353.900" offset="5562312">And indeed, to require the jury to know of that fact is more likely to produce deadlocks and bargaining that will end up with the imposition of the death penalty rather than the jury doesn't know it and finally the jury gives up and it goes to the judge.</text>

I would think that... that what would probably happen is that the six who were voting for the death penalty, if they know that if the jury is deadlocked, the person won't even be put to prison for life... he'll get something less than life...

            <text syncTime="1792.983" offset="7318681">The court of appeals gave an explanation of why it believed that the submission of these two factors was harmless error by adopting a methodology that says we're going to redact the factors and consider whether, with the valid remaining factors, this jury would have, beyond a reasonable doubt, reached the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.993" offset="7390779">This is a court of appeals that is under a statutory obligation to review the entire record in the case, and its opinion makes clear that it did that because its statement of the facts reviews in some detail the procedural history of the case, the evidence surrounding the crime, the mitigating factors that the jury actually found, and the application that the jury reached based on those factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.329" offset="7480118">After the court of appeals declared, wrongly in our view, that two of the non-statutory factors were invalid, it went on to examine then whether that was harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.596" offset="7517107">It recalled in its opinion that there were mitigating factors, and it said it was considering those mitigating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.298" offset="7543961">It noted that the Government had placed primary stress on the statutory aggravating factors that the jury found and that the court of appeals did not invalidate, and it said that, reviewing that material, its conclusion was that the error in this case was harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.320" offset="7608013">Now, this Court has reversed several State court determinations of harmless error upon consideration of the invalid aggravating factors when the court of appeals either summarily announced with nothing more that it found the error to be harmless or when the court of appeals... the State court in those cases did not, indeed, make clear that it either acknowledged that mitigating evidence existed or that it was conducting harmless error analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.496" offset="7704771">Those things are clearly inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.017" offset="7714802">What the court of appeals in this case did is not in our view constitutionally inadequate under the standards that this Court has announced in its review of State court decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.313" offset="7755971">Now, if one steps back from what the court of appeals actually did and asks whether these factors were invalid and if they were invalid what influence, if any, did that have on the jury, I think it's vital to understand that the two factors in question related to evidence that was properly before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.426" offset="7832457">They related to factors that the jury was entitled to consider as petitioner concedes, and the error, if any, in them is in loose drafting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.323" offset="7872059">The first factor refers to the victim's young age, slight stature, background, and unfamiliarity with the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.397" offset="7900376">And these were things that the prosecution had argued to the jury made the victim more vulnerable, made her an ideal victim for petitioner, and thereby exacerbated the culpability of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.975" offset="7946665">And if the factor itself didn't spell out that that is the reason why it was an aggravating factor, the argument to the jury, which we have reproduced in appendix to our brief, surely made that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.782" offset="7993894">Now, the second factor that petitioner has challenged adverts to the personal characteristics of the victim and the effect of the crime on her family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.888" offset="8030361">And that is language which is virtually verbatim out of this Court's decision in Payne v. Tennessee, which makes clear that the specific harm that a crime causes is a cognizable feature of the sentencing jury's consideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2175.747" offset="8849770">And Congress implemented that holding by providing that if the Government wishes to offer victim impact evidence, it must allege it as a nonstatutory aggravating factor, give the defendant notice, and put it forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.038" offset="8906926">And I think that although it could have been made more explicit in the aggravating factor itself, it's hard to understand how that would have benefitted petitioner in any way if the jury were told you may find that this crime is particularly exacerbated because of the exceptional harm that it inflicted in taking this victim's life and causing these effects on her family.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.891" offset="8994279">As it is, it presents to the jury the opportunity of taking the evidence, which it heard and which petitioner concedes that it legitimately heard, and factoring that into its weighing analysis once it has crossed the threshold and determined that this defendant is eligible for a capital sentence because a statutory aggravating factor has been found.</text>

            <label>Mr. Timothy Crooks</label>
            <text syncTime="3380.820" offset="13670093">First, I would like to return to Justice Ginsburg's question about the question of harmlessness in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.136" offset="13711262">This was an extremely close and difficult decision for this jury because they took a day and a half to reach a penalty decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.512" offset="13740833">And it's also significant to remember that if even one juror had weighed the balance between aggravating factors and mitigating factors differently, no death sentence would have resulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.045" offset="13778972">And on this record particularly, it simply can't be said beyond a reasonable doubt that the error was harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.649" offset="13801333">With respect to the validity of the aggravating factors at issue, again we stress that we do not dispute the admissibility of victim characteristic and survivor impact evidence in capital sentencing hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.291" offset="13859951">The problem here is the use in this weighing jurisdiction of vague and overbroad aggravating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.225" offset="13887641">And as the factors were drafted and submitted to the jury, they allowed the jury to consider not only the things which the Government highlighted in its argument, but many other impermissible considerations that were very vaguely and broadly worded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.625" offset="13949290">And the jury, because this was a weighing jurisdiction, once having found them, was required to weigh them on death's side of the scale.</text>

            <text syncTime="3459.411" offset="13984399">--May I ask you a question about the... the hung jury aspect of it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.504" offset="14000804">Suppose this judge has... had told the jury correctly there are only two penalties for this crime: death, life without release.</text>

            <text syncTime="3490.102" offset="14107174">For you to impose either one, you must be unanimous.</text>

            <text syncTime="3514.980" offset="14206648">But the instruction which was proposed by the defense in this case would likewise have taken care of the problem because the jury would have been told that no lesser sentence would result unless they unanimously voted for it and that the effect of a deadlock would not be the lesser sentence but would be life without parole.</text>

            <text syncTime="3535.482" offset="14288673">The cure doesn't... in cases where there are only two sentences, doesn't involve telling the jury hung what happens if they're hung.</text>
