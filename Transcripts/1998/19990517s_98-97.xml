            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="7.685">This case which is originally filed as Anderson against Roe, but now has a different name because California has a new Director of its Department of Social Services, comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.697">In 1992, California enacted a statute that limits the maximum welfare benefits available to a family that has resided in California for less than 12 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.732">It limits it to the amount of what have been payable by the state from which the family had moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.983">As an example to illustrate the way the statute works, the record indicates that for a family of three, California had a welfare grant of $641 per month.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.981">Family coming from Louisiana however would receive only $190 a month, and one coming from Oklahoma will receive $341 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.340">The variation depending on the state from which the family came.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.043">The questions presented by the case are whether the 1992 statute was constitutional when it was enacted, and if not whether an amendment of the Social Security Act enacted by Congress in 1996 affects that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.606">Without reaching the merits the Court of Appeals affirmed a preliminary injunction entered by the District Courts enjoining implementation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.412">We of course granted certiorari and we now affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.318">What we have described as a constitutional right to travel actually embraces three different components.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.583">The right to enter and leave another state, the right to be treated as a welcome visitor while temporary present in another state, and for those travelers who would like to become permanent residents, the right to be treated like other citizens of that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.677">It is this last aspect of the right to travel that is clearly implicated by California's durational residency requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.177">It is understood that the respondents and the members of the class that they represent are citizens of California, and that their need for welfare benefits is unrelated to the length of time they have resided in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.458">The classifications challenged in this case are defined entirely by, first, the period of residency in California and secondly, the location of the state from which the disfavored class members have come.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.805">In 1969, in a case called Shapiro against Thompson, this Court held that it was constitutionally impermissible for a state to enact a durational residence requirement to inhibit the migration of needy persons into the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.961">California which spends nearly $3 billion a year on its welfare program does not contend that the statute was enacted to deter people from coming to California, rather it argues that the statute purpose was entirely fiscal, noting that it would save over $10 million a year if it could be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.883">The State's legitimate interest in saving money does not however provide an adequate justification for its decision to discriminate among equally eligible citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.292">The right of a newly arrived citizen to the same privileges and immunities enjoyed by other citizens is plainly identified in the Fourteenth Amendment's Privilege or Immunities Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.010">Of greater importance, the Fourteenth Amendment's Citizenship Clause expressly equates citizenship with residents and does not tolerate a hierarchy of subclasses of similarly situated citizens based on the location of their prior residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.964">The Congress passed a statute approving durational residency requirements does not alter our analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.869">This Court has consistently held that Congress may not authorize the states to violate the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.141">Citizens of the United States, whether rich or poor, have the right to choose to be citizens of a state wherein they reside.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.916">The states however do not have any right to select their citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.997">As Justice Jackson observed, if national citizenship means less than this, it means nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.871">We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.074">The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion, which Justice Thomas has joined, and Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice has joined.</text>
