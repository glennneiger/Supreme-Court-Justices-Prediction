            <text syncTime="1324.498" offset="5445954">You made quite a point of the fact that most patent infringements are by private parties in... in the economy and the States are not big players in patent infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.823" offset="5479286">But how do we know that isn't changing and changing very rapidly?</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.306" offset="5493184">And this is a question I wanted to ask you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.078" offset="5500289">One of the amicus briefs says that the State of Florida has some 200 patents now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.649" offset="5514604">I assume that's a fairly recent development, or maybe you'll tell me they've been on the books since Florida became a State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.054" offset="5536129">My hunch is that Florida, like States all over the country, are engaging in more and more intellectual activity that leads to patent situations where they apply for patents or they possibly engage in activities that might infringe patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.812" offset="5591195">What is your view on whether there is change going on in this area?</text>

            <text syncTime="1366.015" offset="5611988">Certainly it can't... I would have to concede that the States are engaging in activities that are involved with intellectual property more today than they were 100 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.042" offset="5656083">However, the fact that the State of Florida has 200 patents... that's one side of the patent process, and that does not imply... I don't see any connection between that and the fact that Florida will now all of a sudden be accused of infringing 200 patents.</text>

            <text syncTime="1392.763" offset="5718986">But the more that any entity, a private business or a State or... gets involved in this kind of development where there are arguments about invention infringement and so forth, they're bound to be also questions of infringement arising not necessarily deliberately but just that they're an active participant in the intellectual marketplace where all these problems arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.605" offset="5798398">And that seems to me quite... quite wrong to assume that the absence of a lot of litigation in the past means that there's just no problem out there because your view basically would say that States... in fact, they would motivate States to get involved in all sorts of activity because they will always have one free shot.</text>

            <text syncTime="1449.991" offset="5947923">You need to give them a real remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.712" offset="5954819">I suggest that the State of Florida, the Supreme Court of Florida has said to patentees who've claimed that the State has infringed on their patents, we will give you a meaningful remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.088" offset="5992331">That being the case, our sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment simply can't be abrogated because Congress may think that the State of West Virginia doesn't provide due process, although of course, the record before this Court and before Congress doesn't... doesn't suggest that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.598" offset="6050323">The United States in their brief at footnote 9 admits that takings liability does not require a... an independent waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.244" offset="6088984">So, I suggest that every State has takings remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="1540.062" offset="6308204">I suggest that the balancing test then in City of Boerne between the evil and the remedy then comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.417" offset="6337670">And I would suggest as a model the... the preclearance procedures in the Voting Rights Act where at least the Attorney General or someone has to make a determination up front that the State... this particular State has... has violated someone's due process rights, and then in that State, maybe the remedy could be provided.</text>

            <text syncTime="2856.672" offset="11574594">But the question in this case, I respectfully submit, is whether or not what Congress did... in 1992, Congress heard there was a problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.700" offset="11742718">First, as I said, there's no doubt, based on the record, that Congress could have reasonably concluded that many States had inadequate procedures, but more important, in choosing a means to prevent due process violations, which is the purpose of section 5 legislation, Congress could properly take into account first the unique and fragile nature of the patent right; second, the benefits for what over 200 years the... has been a system of exclusively Federal court enforcement; and third... and I think perhaps most important... the threat to patent owners and to the patent system that altering this would produce.</text>

            <text syncTime="2955.726" offset="11970819">Now, I would agree with you if what you mean by adequate is adequate for purposes of Article I, that is, remedies that would not achieve the... the fullest, most uniform, most facile protection of the patent right that they would like to achieve under Article I. But I think what you have to mean is adequate for purposes of the Takings Clause, and I--</text>

            <text syncTime="3171.539" offset="12834114">But we know from dozens of this Court's opinions that what process is due depends on the nature of the right, and the nature of this right happens to be derived from Article I and the... the Patent and Copyright Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.171" offset="12904645">And because appropriate legislation does not need to be the least restrictive alternative legislation, Congress can appropriately take account of the way the system works, what the Constitution envisioned and what has become a... a system of expeditious determination of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.066" offset="12996178">And let me just mention one other thing before my time is up about the unique nature of this right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.289" offset="13013105">One of the really fascinating things about patent rights is how asymmetrical the legal protections are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.833" offset="13039332">A patent owner is very, very vulnerable because, due to the application of rules like offensive collateral estoppel... and this goes to another point that Justice O'Connor was raising... a patent owner only has to lose once before he is precluded in the courts of another State by principles of offensive collateral estoppel from trying to litigate it again, whereas the opposite is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.581" offset="13146330">And what that dictates, in terms of protecting and preserving the nature of this paradigmatic intellectual property right, is a system where there is... where there are remedies that are well known, expeditious, and where there is an immediate, essentially, appeal to one appellate authority that will finally render a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.186" offset="13232743">Now, you can say, as you... as you did before... and I know you're about to--</text>

            <text syncTime="3288.958" offset="13303796">But I think what that reflects is the very beginning of what has been a long trend of what Congress has required... has thought to be necessary in order to make efficacious the system that the Constitution plainly wanted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3403.453" offset="13761775">With all due respect to General Waxman, it seems that they are taking an inconsistent position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.155" offset="13788628">In their brief, on page 16 and 17, the United States cites to several cases that say, for example, patents are property and entitled to the same rights and sanctions as other property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.013" offset="13831992">Again, for the... by the laws of the United States, the rights of a party under a patent are his private property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.448" offset="13857696">Similarly, College Savings Bank cites at page 20 of their... of their brief, under the Court's holding in Consolidated Fruit Jar, a patent for an invention is as much property as a patent for land, an uncompensated, State sponsored violation of a patent owner's right to exclude also must constitute a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.678" offset="13930630">After taking these positions, to assert that the common law remedies available in the State courts for takings torts or whatever are a violation of due process just seems inconsistent to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.367" offset="13981412">In James v. Campbell... it's a Federal case from the late 1800's... said in fact that the infringing of a patent by the Federal Government is a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.314" offset="14021223">So, once again, to assert that the infringement by the State cannot be remedied by an adequate State taking remedy is simply inconsistent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3492.169" offset="14116622">But I take it in the patent picture, there isn't that possibility for enforcement, is there?</text>

            <text syncTime="3525.280" offset="14249115">The statute is not written that way, but there certainly is a huge Patent and Trademark Office out there by the airport, and they employ a lot of people.</text>

            <text syncTime="3555.550" offset="14370114">Because as the Framers indicated in the Plan of the Convention, it's necessary that the States, in creating the Union, had waived their sovereign immunity with respect to suits by the United States, because there has to be someone, some... some authority that can... can adjudicate and deal with differences among the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.750" offset="14438973">And that's... that's the job of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.432" offset="14445660">I'd also say that in terms of applying the Federal circuit patent law precedents, State courts are often called upon to apply Federal law and... and foreign law, and they... they certainly have the ability to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.866" offset="14519430">But the bottom line, as General Waxman said, Congress... Congress perceived there to be a problem out there, and maybe there is.</text>
