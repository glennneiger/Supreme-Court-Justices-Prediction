            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="85456">The second case is Wyoming against Houghton 98-184.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.218" offset="110325">During a routine traffic stop, a Wyoming Highway Patrol officer noticed a hypodermic syringe in the driver's shirt pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.514" offset="147418">With refreshing candor, the driver admitted that he used the syringe to take drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.931" offset="169152">On the basis of that statement the officer ordered the driver and his two women passengers including respondent out of the car, while he searched the vehicle for contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.009" offset="209485">One of the items he searched was respondent's purse sitting on the backseat.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.949" offset="225159">Inside the purse he found drugs and drug paraphernalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.761" offset="240414">Respondent was convicted on drug possession charges, but the Wyoming Supreme Court reversed her conviction, holding that the search of the purse violated the Fourth Amendment because the officer didn't have probable cause to believe the respondent or a person particular was concealing contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.176" offset="314080">In an opinion filed with the Clerk of the Court today and authored by Justice Scalia, we reverse the decision of the Supreme Court of Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.474" offset="343337">Probable cause to search a car extends all containers in the car capable of concealing the object of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.600" offset="371758">In previous cases we have held it is reasonable to conduct a warrant less search of a car that police have probable cause to believe contains contraband and that search may extend all containers within the car capable of holding the contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.475" offset="427347">The historical understanding of the Fourth Amendment of those cases rely on does not admit of the distinction based upon ownership of the contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.006" offset="465381">Justice Breyer has filed a concurring opinion and Justice Stevens joined by Justices Ginsburg and Souter has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
