            <text syncTime="13.831" offset="199899">Congress intended the PLRA attorney's fee cap to apply to cases precisely like the two before the Court this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.275" offset="233649">Congress intended not only to limit frivolous claims in cases and to limit Federal court involvement in the details of State prison management, but it also intended to relieve States of some of the financial burden of such cases and, in particular, some of the financial burden of attorney's fees ancillary to such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.998" offset="312539">42 U.S.C. 1988 provides that a district court may allow reasonable fees to prevailing parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="3033.537" offset="12278711">I have one basically simple problem with your statutory argument, to the extent that you are arguing that at no time may the court prospectively change the rate in this case to conform to the new... to the new act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.830" offset="12351853">The problem that I have with it is that I assume... I have to assume... that Congress legislated against a background of... of fee award practices in... in which we... we all find it a familiar feature of the system, that the court is constantly reexamining fee orders in... in these continuing cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.668" offset="12459269">Lawyers come in, just as I guess... I don't know whether you did, but I gather a lawyer did in this case and said I ought to paid more, and that was even for work that had been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.925" offset="12504304">But in any case, I ought to get a higher rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.207" offset="12513395">And it seems to me that the... that the background principle against which Congress probably legislated was the principle in which adjustments are made as we go along.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.388" offset="12570133">Now, we may fight about the retroactive effect of making that adjustment with respect to a post-enactment period for work done before the adjustment is made.</text>

            <text syncTime="3119.974" offset="12624467">But with respect to an adjustment which is by any standard totally prospective, the adjustment that is made when the court says, from now on any work that you do is going to be compensated at the... at the rate under the new statute, it seems to me that that is probably in conformance with what Congress would have assumed as a background principle for the way fee awards in continuing cases are made.</text>
