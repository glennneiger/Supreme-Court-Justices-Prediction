            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="148816">We'll hear argument now in No. 98-536, Tommy Olmstead v. L.C., by Jonathan Zimring.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.879" offset="192284">Ms. Downing.</text>

            <label>Ms. Beverly P. Downing</label>
            <text syncTime="12.309" offset="198031">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.421" offset="210465">Title II A of the Americans with Disabilities Act, that general language prohibiting discrimination by reason of disability, cannot impose a least restrictive treatment requirement on the State's provision of hospital services to its disabled citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.451" offset="266576">By reenacting essentially the same language of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Congress did not suddenly impose or allow the Department of Justice to impose de institutionalization on the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.280" offset="317880">Georgia believes that this expansive new interpretation of the ADA is precluded by the language of the statute, is precluded by the Court's prior interpretations of section 504, would require a plain statement in the statute which is undeniably missing, and that the Federal Government's inconsistent interpretation of its integration regulation is not entitled to deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.774" offset="399905">Here, the general language of the statute prohibiting discrimination by reason of disability is being used to bar the provision of hospital services offered on a voluntary basis unless Georgia, at the same time, fully funds all demand for another service, a community bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.264" offset="461867">But by providing a person with a hospital bed and by asking the person to wait a short time until a community bed is available, Georgia does not exclude a person by reason of disability, neither does Georgia discriminate against her by reason of disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.993" offset="520695">What Georgia did here was simply to provide hospital services to two mentally disabled patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.228" offset="545668">There appears to be little debate as to the involuntary treatment that was provided to these patients when they were eminently dangerous to themselves or others and did not consent to that treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.293" offset="585897">It would be illegal under Georgia law, the Constitution, and presumably the ADA to confine them involuntarily without a medical and dangerousness justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.762" offset="627797">And Georgia did not do that, and there appears to be little contention that they did.</text>

            <text syncTime="123.745" offset="643784">Ms. Downing, just to clarify the dimensions of this case, do I understand correctly that you are saying these two women are appropriately placed as far as medical needs are concerned in a community based facility?</text>
            <text syncTime="144.027" offset="724868">So, it's not that they need the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.168" offset="729466">You're not challenging that on the facts, but you're saying they must wait their turn on line.</text>

            <text syncTime="157.838" offset="780143">Your Honor, at the point that the patients were placed, they did... they were appropriate for placement in the community and they did have to wait a short time in order to make their way up the waiting list.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.366" offset="830194">There were times prior to the time that they were placed when the parties would dispute whether they were appropriate for community treatment or not, but at the time that they were placed and for a short time before, we would agree that they were appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="187.467" offset="898635">I... I understood it to be that it's up to the State to decide what voluntary facilities it will make available for the... for the mentally ill, that if the State chooses to have only institutional facilities, it may do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.377" offset="958298">And if it chooses to have, in addition, community based facilities, it may have them in addition, but it will be up to the State how many people it will put in those... allow to go into those community based facilities, because we're talking here about voluntary admissions.</text>

            <label>Ms. Beverly P. Downing</label>
            <text syncTime="324.330" offset="1446057">Well, what we know is that the original integration regulation was promulgated by HEW in 1977, and that the rule... the notice at that point described it as providing access to treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.147" offset="1501332">The examples that it gave were that a Medicaid provider would need to make its services available to the handicapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.631" offset="1531320">For instance, a doctor would need to have a ramp, a wheelchair ramp, to get into the facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.776" offset="1551905">That was in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.267" offset="1557861">In 1978, the... a similar version was repromulgated as the coordination regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.721" offset="1583670">And again, the examples that were given there did not ever mention least restrictive treatment or anything like it.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="365.326" offset="1610106">Well, this... do you challenge the regulation that was adopted by the Attorney General, or do you challenge the interpretation of that regulation?</text>
            <text syncTime="379.495" offset="1666739">Do you say that the Attorney General lacked authority to adopt that regulation?</text>

            <text syncTime="385.519" offset="1690876">We don't say that the Attorney General lacked authority to promulgate it in the way that it was interpreted at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.155" offset="1721387">What we say is that the interpretation that it's being given today, as of 1994 in the Helen L. case for the first time, is a reversal of the prior interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="416.079" offset="1813129">Is that right?</text>

            <text syncTime="430.138" offset="1869345">It's our position that discrimination by reason of disability applies to... requires even handed treatment of the handicapped relative to the non handicapped.</text>

            <text syncTime="444.558" offset="1927023">Because it seems to me that your argument in this respect assumes that there is some kind of uniform and unvarying class of persons who are handicapped.</text>

            <text syncTime="474.198" offset="2045515">Let's assume that there is a class of handicapped persons who, because of their handicaps, are simply unsuited to live outside of an institution.</text>

            <text syncTime="490.748" offset="2111761">And, of course, assume, three, there's a general population of people who don't live in institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.960" offset="2128584">If the Government treats the second group, those whose handicaps are irrelevant to institutionalization, the same way it treats the first group, those who have to live in institutions because of the handicap, isn't that... and they do so on the grounds that there is a handicap, even though it does not require institutionalization, in that case isn't the Government engaging in the discrimination on the basis of handicap to the... in... in relation to the second group?</text>
