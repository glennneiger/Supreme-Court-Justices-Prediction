            <text syncTime="132.587" offset="676828">Article 25... excuse me... article 22 limits that liability, and article 25, you lose the limit if you have willful misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.391" offset="708070">But if you read that there's a recovery outside of the convention that your holding is that you have an instance where you have passengers attempting to prove that there isn't an accident so that they are unable to seek damages without limit.</text>

            <text syncTime="202.716" offset="957383">The carriers were free to disclaim any and all liability, and it was a compromise to have the liability that was created under the convention to be limited except for in the circumstances provided for.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.673" offset="997193">So, if you allow the passengers to seek unlimited recovery outside the convention, you're creating an incentive for them to try and prove there isn't an accident so that when they don't have bodily injury, they can seek unlimited damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="239.230" offset="1103460">Well, they... I don't believe the drafters thought they were doing that because when they drafted the convention, they also had article 20 which was the all necessary measures defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.364" offset="1131985">Although carriers that fly into and out of the United States are not entitled to avail themselves of the all necessary measures defense, that's where the fault issue really came into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.242" offset="1167407">It was the unusual, unexpected occurrence as defined by Saks which would determine whether you have the accident requirement, and even if you did, if the carrier was able to establish that it had taken all reasonable measures that it could take, it wouldn't be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.780" offset="1221638">And if... it was only if you weren't able to establish that burden as the carrier, then you would have limited liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="311.937" offset="1394255">A very recent example is the KAL case; that is, it is an accident, but the conduct was found by a jury to be... to amount to willful misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.356" offset="1443887">So, as far as I know, the cases that have come up under the convention involving willful misconduct have been categorized as accidents, and then the question is, if the conduct was so egregious, the limits on liability are off.</text>

            <text syncTime="348.572" offset="1540749">Well, there are the willful misconduct instances with respect to, for example, the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.849" offset="1565931">The terrorist attack of placing the bomb on board the aircraft wasn't what was found to be the willful misconduct, although it clearly was intentional conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.193" offset="1603234">The willful misconduct on the part of the carrier had to do with their security measures and their program or the lack thereof.</text>

            <text syncTime="595.079" offset="2526820">In Franklin Mint, the Court recognized the dual purposes of the convention, which were to create a uniform body of aviation law and to limit the carrier's presumptive liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.771" offset="2561615">In Saks, the Court broadly defined what constitutes an accident contemplated by article 17 and held that the carrier is liable to a passenger only if the passenger proves there was an accident that was the cause of the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.589" offset="2608844">Then in Chan, the Court enforced the limited liability created by the drafters and looked to the parallel notice provisions with respect to baggage and cargo to interpret the notice provision for the passenger tickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.859" offset="2661925">In Floyd, the Court enforced the article 17 bodily injury requirement holding that the carrier cannot be held liable under 17 unless the accident has caused bodily injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.225" offset="2707378">In Zicherman, the Court gave the most natural reading of article 24 and held that in an action brought under article 17, article 24 directs the lower court to look to local law to determine the measure of the passenger's recovery and who may bring a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.927" offset="2762235">We contend that in this case that the Court once again needs to interpret the convention as a whole and not attempt to divine what article 17 or article 24 means read standing alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="2502.218" offset="10155411">And then section 4 says, but in return for that, you're going to be liable in the following ways, and then it lists a whole bunch of them with qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.155" offset="10191146">And in that context, all that article 24 meant was it meant to refer to the three kinds of liabilities or situations you may have, to people, to luggage, and for delay.</text>

            <text syncTime="3435.485" offset="13888413">Your Honors, I would just like to make two brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.168" offset="13911192">One is that the court below specifically found that there was no willful misconduct in this case, and that's referenced at page 27 of the appendix to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.645" offset="13953092">And also that accident can encompass intentional torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.278" offset="13971587">That's what article 25 can look to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.040" offset="13982663">It is only if you have willful misconduct that you get an unlimited recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.871" offset="13998023">Accident wasn't ever meant to mean unintended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.183" offset="14011189">I also would note that you should meet the terms and conditions of article 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.768" offset="14029579">You have to meet the terms and conditions of article 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.109" offset="14038878">There is a symmetry there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.275" offset="14043580">And with respect to the issue of article 18, I believe that the fact that the liability is broader in scope with respect to baggage and cargo should not mean that if... where you have a narrower scope of liability under the convention, you then get to get recovery outside of the convention.</text>
