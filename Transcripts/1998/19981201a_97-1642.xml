            <text syncTime="7.867" offset="183183">We'll wait just a minute, Mr. Lamken.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey A. Lamken</label>
            <text syncTime="52.747" offset="362697">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="55.378" offset="373146">For well over a century, it has been settled law that no plaintiff may obtain money from the United States Treasury absent an act of Congress entitling the plaintiff to the money or creating the... or authorizing the creation of a right to that money.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.867" offset="419121">That rule has been repeatedly recognized in this Court's cases, including Buchanan v. Alexander, United States v. Nordic Village, United States v. Testan, OPM v. Richmond, and Republic National Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.814" offset="462903">Probably nowhere has that rule been more often repeated than in the context of subcontractor efforts to obtain payment from the United States under an equitable lien theory when the prime contractor that should have paid this prime contract... the subcontractor does not.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="91.693" stopTime="132.189">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="91.693" offset="518491">Mr. Lamken, I note you're getting down to this specific case, but for the broad, sweeping proposition you announced originally, I'm thinking of cases like Westcott v. Califano where Congress said benefits go to fathers not mothers, and this Court said that such a statute... its constitutionality could be saved by including mothers for benefits, for unemployment compensation benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.855" offset="651089">How does that fit with your theory that unless there's a specific act that covers this, no money will be paid from the Treasury?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_a_lamken" startTime="132.189" stopTime="168.212">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey A. Lamken</label>
            <text syncTime="132.189" offset="680450">Well, Your Honor, I would say that in that case the Court was construing the statute in a manner to save its constitutionality consistent with Congress' purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.085" offset="712006">If Congress' express purpose was to exclude somebody that the Court thought was constitutionally included... constitutionally had to be included in the category, then the answer would be that the statute could not be enforced at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.110" offset="752130">The Court could not blue pencil in against Congress' intent a category of people or an entitlement to money that Congress did not want to be entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.605" offset="786090">So, that would have to be categorized as a case where the Court construed the statute in order to make it constitutional and therefore it read the statute as providing for a payment to those individuals.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="168.212" stopTime="179.190">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="168.212" offset="824542">That's something maybe a lawyer could follow, but the statute said unemployed father and the Court said unemployed mothers will be paid under this statute as well.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_a_lamken" startTime="179.190" stopTime="199.294">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey A. Lamken</label>
            <text syncTime="179.190" offset="868428">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.111" offset="872085">It's possible, Your Honor, that the Court stretched quite a bit to save the constitutionality of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.475" offset="889534">But that does not change the underlying principle that absent a statute, nobody may obtain money from the... from the public Treasury, and the courts are not entitled under principles of common law or equity to create entitlements.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.503" offset="945645">The other difference--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="199.294" stopTime="205.279">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="199.294" offset="948885">But you could have that kind of loose interpretation of a statute that would accommodate the kind of case I just described.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="206.260" offset="976679">You could... you said absent a statute, but you just described a statute that on its face doesn't cover something, but will be construed by a court to cover something and that fits within your theory.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_a_lamken" startTime="218.178" stopTime="242.978">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey A. Lamken</label>
            <text syncTime="218.178" offset="1024431">I think it would, but there's another point to it, which is when we say that absent a statute, we include in statutes all positive sources of law that are above common law and court-made law and we would include the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.018" offset="1075735">So, if the Constitution required a payment from the United States Treasury... and I think it would be rare that it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.773" offset="1094752">If the Constitution required a payment from the United States Treasury, then the Court might have it within its power to order that payment be made.</text>

            <text syncTime="249.661" offset="1150341">In this... in this case before the Army paid Verdan in 1994, could it have said, you know, we have 86,000 dollars we're going to pay Verdan, but we have notice that Blue Fox hasn't been paid?</text>
            <text syncTime="269.475" offset="1229544">We're going to put this money into a... a court escrow account and... and allow Blue Fox to make its claim in court.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.005" offset="1275729">The... the Army could not have done that without declaring the prime contractor in default.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.340" offset="1297045">So long as the contract was in force, it was contractually obligated to pay the prime contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.543" offset="1317838">If it had decided that the prime contractor was in default because it had failed to pay Blue Fox, then it could proceed with the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.927" offset="1347409">It would hire a replacement prime contractor, and if at the end of the day there was money left over on the contract that was owed to the prime contractor, it could satisfy the contractual obligation to pay the original prime contractor for the work it did by filing interpleader.</text>

            <text syncTime="970.258" offset="4032692">I've got Bowen in front of me.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.831" offset="4038961">At... at 899, Justice Stevens quoted from Judge Bork in the court of appeals there in... in characterizing the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.748" offset="4086713">The quotation includes this.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.101" offset="4100088">Both reports go on to say that the time has now come to eliminate the sovereign immunity defense in all equitable actions for specific performance against a Federal agency or officer acting in an official capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.057" offset="4151915">And this Court then, at the end of... of that quotation and... and much more, said thus the combined effect of the 1970 hearing and the 1976 legislative material is to demonstrate conclusively that the exception for an action seeking money damages should not be broadened beyond the meaning of the plain language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.781" offset="4234775">If we follow that rationale, it seems to me that we would have difficulty in accepting your... your very starchy position that if there is otherwise an accepted equitable basis for going after the res, that would still be impossible under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.285" offset="4304783">It seems to me if we accept that rationale, it... it would be perfectly possible, in fact, the only thing that we could do.</text>

            <text syncTime="1086.988" offset="4499657">And it seems to me that in... in Bowen at least, this Court thought that the kind of equitable claim that is being made here, leaving aside the problem of exhaustion of the res, would be a claim that was no longer precluded.</text>

            <text syncTime="1105.371" offset="4573113">The first is in Bowen the Court had no reason to consider whether or not section 702, in effect, licensed courts to create rights to money from the Treasury under common law or equitable principles because in that case there was a statute that entitled the plaintiff to the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.579" offset="4629956">And it's clear that Congress has the authority to create that right to the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.963" offset="4647510">The question and what the Ninth Circuit read section 702 as doing is creating an implied authorization for the courts under common law or under equitable principles to create a right to the money where Congress had not using equitable principles.</text>

            <text syncTime="1178.288" offset="4864849">That's correct, but what... I think what your question implies is that the exclusion of money damages implies in the courts the power to create, as a substantive matter, new rights to money so long as in... in the end you can collect the money without it being money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.850" offset="4935066">And that is a leap that you cannot make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.689" offset="4942485">And I think, for example, United States v. Testan is a very good example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.542" offset="4957845">In Testan, the statute specifically stated that the Court of Claims would have jurisdiction to enter judgments on claims against the United States based on, among other things, statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.850" offset="5003089">This Court held that as a matter of sovereign immunity, the Government's immunity to suit, the ability to haul the United States into court, had been waived, but if the statute did not take the further step of creating a right to money from the United States based on any particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.522" offset="5069753">And so, based on... if there was a simple statutory violation, the Court of Federal Claims could not give damages for that... the violation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.018" offset="5103712">It could only give money for the violation of the statute if the statute itself provided that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.410" offset="5125342">The same thing happened again in Nordic Village.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.491" offset="5133596">The statute waived immunity, saying that the judgments of the courts would bind the United States, but since the statute itself did not expressly state that the court could create new money payment obligations against the United States, this Court held that it applied only to non-monetary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.523" offset="5205799">In other words, what the courts cannot do is create substantive new rights to money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.318" offset="5224921">Section 702 is not a license for them to step out and say, well, this previous right, equitable liens, was not enforceable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3400.133" offset="13752228">The basic principle that we believe should control this case is that anybody seeking money from the United States must show a waiver of immunity and a substantive source of law applicable to the United States giving them a right to the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.364" offset="13817116">In our view, neither section 702 nor Pearlman make equity a source of substantive law applicable to the United States that gives rise to the right to money from the Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.804" offset="13866854">In Pearlman, the United States was not a party and the rights that were recognized were rights to money that operated against only other private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.358" offset="13897156">In fact, in OPM v. Richmond, there existed in that very case a waiver of immunity, but the court rejected the notion that the... that the lower Federal courts could create a right to money under the theory of equitable estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.536" offset="13949819">We think the same rule applies to creating rights to money under a theory of equitable liens.</text>

            <text syncTime="3454.989" offset="13971657">May I just ask one question about the phrasing of the question presented in your cert petition?</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.582" offset="13990047">It asks whether section 702 permits respondent to bring an action, so forth and so on, which seems to me to raise squarely the sovereign immunity question whether this is a money damage case or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.409" offset="14029335">I don't see that it raises the question whether there's any other source of... of law that would support the claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="3475.574" offset="14053995">I think it squarely raises that question for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.095" offset="14064026">First, the... the way we read the Ninth Circuit decision... I think the proper way to read it... is that section 702 renders certain sources of law applicable to the United States and create the liens, so that section 702 in a real sense permits people to assert--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3498.127" offset="14144170">But you're saying that they read it as an authorization statute, not merely as a waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3502.420" offset="14161410">--That's correct, but I think that the second answer is that that in fact is a sovereign immunity issue and the Court consistently has treated the creation of substantive monetary rights against the United States as an issue of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.079" offset="14208013">It treated it... that as an issue of sovereign immunity in the United States v. Testan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.311" offset="14220970">It created... treated it as an issue in the United States v. Nordic Village, and it treated it again as an issue of sovereign immunity in United States v. Idaho because sovereign immunity has two inherent components.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.946" offset="14263497">One is an immunity to suit, and the other is an immunity of the United States' property and its funds to seizure and encumbrances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.342" offset="14293068">And any plaintiff seeking to get money from the Treasury must overcome both. It must show both jurisdiction in the Federal court and that Congress has affirmatively intended money to be leaving the Treasury based on this source of law. And I... thank you.</text>
