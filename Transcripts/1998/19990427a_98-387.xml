            <text syncTime="17.973" offset="216069">The Federal scheme at issue here is so riddled with exceptions that it cannot materially advance the Government's asserted interests, and it is insufficiently tailored, because those interests could be advanced more effectively by regulating the underlying conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.045" offset="292347">The asserted interests are helping States that want to protect their residents from exposure to advertising for gambling activities reducing the social costs of gambling, but Federal law now permits advertising promoting Government casinos, Indian casinos, race track and off track betting to be broadcast from within even States that have not authorized those forms of gambling.</text>

            <text syncTime="76.773" offset="451171">You can tax based on casinos, assume it's a stable category and you could pass a regulation prohibiting all advertising for casino gambling.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="118.880" offset="619609">--The reason, Justice Kennedy, is that the Government doesn't assert, and it's certainly not obvious that there is any difference in the social costs between gambling at Government and Indian casinos and gambling at private casinos, particularly when the Federal law allows the Government and Indian casinos to provide the same games operated by the very same private companies.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="142.455" offset="713963">But can't the Government weigh on the other side of that equation the fact that casino gambling may be essential to the well being of Indian tribes as a source of income, whereas it doesn't have to weigh that and say that's very desirable that private casino owners have a similar source of income?</text>

            <text syncTime="159.927" offset="783867">I think not, Chief Justice Rehnquist, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.591" offset="794524">First, here, as in discovery, the fact that there may be social benefits associated with Indian and Government casino gambling has absolutely nothing to do with whether the Federal scheme materially advances the Government's interest in reducing the social costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.331" offset="869444">Second, even if there were such benefits, those benefits would not satisfy the Central Hudson test under the fourth prong, because the very same benefits could be obtained by taxing private casinos and giving those revenues to State governments or Indian tribes.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.324" offset="949378">--Not if you don't have any private casinos in the States where the Indians are located.</text>

            <text syncTime="210.332" offset="985427">Well, Justice Scalia, if the private casinos are not in those States, those States are not going to be that concerned about them, but if they are there, they could be taxed by the Federal Government and the proceeds distributed, so the social benefits argument here, as in discovery, isn't sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.450" offset="1045927">In discovery, the Government made a very similar argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.841" offset="1055540">They argued that it was okay to allow distribution of newspapers but not of commercial handbills because the newspapers had greater benefits, greater social value, and the court rejected--</text>

            <text syncTime="338.944" offset="1499935">Justice Souter, the answer to that is, is that the statute itself does not prohibit all broadcast advertising even of gambling activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.292" offset="1533267">It only prohibits broadcast advertising of, quote, games of lot or chance, and the FCC, the implementing agency has interpreted that for more than 12 years as if the advertising does not directly advertise gambling activities, then it's permitted under this Federal scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.653" offset="1618740">Now, under that interpretation the FCC has repeatedly ruled that even private casinos can broadcast advertising in every State saying that they are a casino, and that the odds for fun, winning a vacation and Vegas style excitement are high, but they cannot advertise--</text>

            <text syncTime="1573.541" offset="6438332">Private casino gambling operations are illegal in 38 States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.086" offset="6460484">Congress supports the policy of those States by prohibiting the casinos that operate legally in the other 12 States from using radio and TV commercials to reach into the homes of people in all 50 States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1617.180" offset="6612830">When casinos operate also as they claim to do, when institutions operate as hotels and restaurants and nightclubs, the FCC has reasonably taken the position that their advertising of those activities is not covered by the ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.792" offset="6683256">Now, there are cases that are close to the line, because an enterprise that runs many different sorts of activities and is prohibited from advertising its gambling activities may well try, through its advertising of other activities, to promote--</text>

            <text syncTime="1667.283" offset="6813241">The FCC has attempted to draw a line between the advertising of nongambling activities and gambling activities, and that's the way the line has been drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.419" offset="6853783">If the word casino is used in connection with too many of these, you know, you have a good chance... too many words connoting chance and luck activities, the FCC has said that in fact constitutes an advertisement for casino gambling, but of course, there are anomalies close to the line.</text>

            <text syncTime="1697.511" offset="6934136">Couldn't one argue that it's somewhat perverse to give free reign to the Las Vegas casinos to advertise the fact that they are casinos, with the implied message that it's gambling, but to prohibit them from giving truthful information about what games are played, what the odds are in their slot machines and all that sort of stuff, which might actually be totally consistent with the Government interest at stake here?</text>

            <text syncTime="1720.819" offset="7027445">Well, I think this is quite unlike the Liquormart and Coors problem, which is I think the analogy that you are drawing, when advertising is generally allowed and particular items are taken out in order... and the result is to make the market in advertising less accurate, or less honest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.520" offset="7106231">This is a situation where what Congress and the FCC has tried to do is eliminate the broadcast advertising market in gambling activities altogether, and the problem that we're talking about arises because enterprises engage in other activities as well and seek to market those activities, and seek to smuggle in their advertising of casino gambling.</text>

            <text syncTime="1767.489" offset="7214064">That is, as Justice Stevens pointed out, as long as the word casino is in the title of the establishment that's doing the advertising, everybody knows that it's casino activity which is being advertised, but one of the things that advertiser cannot do, as I understand it, is advertise his payout ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.213" offset="7297029">He can't say, you have better odds, because the payout ratio here is such and such, than you do in the Indian casino up the road or across the State border, and in that respect there is an analogy to the price advertising in Liquormart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.064" offset="7360350">This is value advertising which is prohibited.</text>

            <text syncTime="1809.657" offset="7382711">The anomaly only arises, as I said, because there is the ability to connote, to evade the prohibition on advertising, the existence of the gambling enterprise.</text>

            <text syncTime="1818.764" offset="7419178">Yes, but that's a fact, and we have to deal with it and, I suppose, if the Government were going to be consistent in its own theory the Government would take the position, the FCC would have taken the position that an establishment that has the word casino in its name may not advertise, because it can't advertise without advertising casinos and everything that connotes, but the Government doesn't take that position.</text>

            <text syncTime="1843.821" offset="7519383">It cannot advertise that it has slot machines, games of chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.344" offset="7541535">It can attempt to connote that, and that's what creates the problem you're discussing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1853.728" offset="7559089">Would you respond to one other point that was raised by Justice Scalia, actually, in the question that he put to Mr. Ennis, and he said there's another feature of 44 Liquormart that's not present here, and that is, there was quite clearly there an advertising ban which put the mom and pop shops and so on at a disadvantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.792" offset="7651249">It interfered with the competition within the market for that kind of liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.246" offset="7673088">And isn't something very much like that present here, because in fact the way the scheme works, all noncasino forms of gambling that are authorized by States and charities can say what they want to say, the Indian casinos which are promoted by the Government can apparently say what they want to say, so that the onus falls entirely on the privately owned casinos, and isn't that, in effect, an interference with competition in the gambling market?</text>

Congress identified a particular problem, the problem of private casino gambling, which is partly a Federal interest because the States have independently, 38 of the States have identified that as a form of gambling.</text>

            <text syncTime="1942.864" offset="7915609">I mean, the only argument that I heard in the Government's brief was, well, the Indian casinos tend to be off in the boondocks somewhere, and people can't get to them easily, and so compulsive gamblers don't resort to them that well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.314" offset="7977362">Well, they may be out in the boondocks, but I don't see that goes to the Government's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.467" offset="7997947">I don't see why that suggests that compulsive gambling isn't going on in the casinos that the Government promotes and allows to advertise as readily as those which are subject to restriction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3355.516" offset="13566208">The first is in response to a question raised by Justice Ginsburg, and that is that the word casino clearly signals to compulsive gamblers and noncompulsive gamblers alike that gambling activity takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.285" offset="13621274">This is remarkably like the Coors case in which the Federal scheme prohibited the hosting of alcohol content on labels but permitted--</text>

            <text syncTime="3396.221" offset="13729003">Not under this scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.481" offset="13734018">Because in Coors the Court said, allowing the use of malt liquor signals high alcohol content, and that means it cannot materially advance the Government's interest, that's equally true with respect to the word casino.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.381" offset="13781666">Second, many... many Indian casinos, and a growing number, are located close to population centers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.175" offset="13808833">Harrah's operates an Indian casino in North Carolina, the Edge state, which it advertises is within a day's drive of half the population of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.663" offset="13850733">Foxwoods, in Connecticut, is within 2 hours from both New York City and Boston, closer than Atlantic City.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.006" offset="13880200">There are at least 22 Indian casinos near Sacramento, 13 near Phoenix, 6 near Portland, Oregon, and growing every day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.561" offset="13914368">Third, this scheme cannot be justified on the basis of the special characteristics of broadcast because the scheme permits broadcast advertising in every State of Government casinos, Indian casinos, and even private casinos when they say, I'm a casino.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.455" offset="13993989">Furthermore, this scheme does prohibit print advertising that uses U.S. mails, and Congress clearly didn't think that broadcast was worse than print, because violations of the print advertising ban, you go to jail for 2 years for each offense, violation of the broadcast ban, you go to jail for 1 year for each offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3485.841" offset="14087507">Four, as of this moment, Justice Scalia, but that's a very recent trend, just in the last year or so, and that's growing as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.165" offset="14116764">Justice Scalia, let me also point out, your off track betting, this scheme permits broadcast advertising not just for race track betting but for off track simulcast betting, so that people can gamble every day, day long, and broadcast advertising is unlimited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.589" offset="14194505">Finally, I just want to answer one question that was asked, and that is, in both Coors and 44 Liquormart this Court ruled that the availability of nonspeech regulations meant that the scheme could not pass the Central Hudson test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.930" offset="14263886">That's this case.</text>
