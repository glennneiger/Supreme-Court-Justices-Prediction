            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="85587">The opinion of the Court in No. 97-1252, Reno versus American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee will be announced by Justice Scalia.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="12.443" offset="135324">This case comes to us on certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.240" offset="154446">The facts are as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.226" offset="162491">In 1987, the Immigration and Naturalization Service instituted deportation proceedings against eight aliens who belong to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.930" offset="209303">A group that the government characterizes as an international terrorist and communist organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.683" offset="236261">The INS charged six of the aliens with routine status violations, such as overstaying of visa and failure to maintain student status.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.864" offset="277012">It charged the other two with membership in a group advocating terrorism.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.466" offset="299373">All eight aliens immediately filed suit against the INS arguing that they had been unconstitutionally singled out for deportation because of their affiliation with a politically unpopular group.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.230" offset="350469">After several years of litigation, the District Court ultimately enjoined deportation proceeding against the aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.042" offset="381711">While the Attorney General's appeal of that injunction was pending, Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1966 known as IIRIRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.760" offset="440539">The 96 that I say 76, whatever -- it was 96 -- and the Attorney General argued that a provision of that Act codified at 8 U.S.C. Section 1252(g) deprived the Federal Court of jurisdiction over the alien suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.761" offset="520578">The Ninth Circuit disagreed and it upheld jurisdiction and affirmed the merits of the District Court's injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.480" offset="547432">We reverse the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.606" offset="556000">Section 1252(g), unlike the rest of IIRIRA, is immediately applicable to aliens who were in deportation proceedings on IRRIRA's effective date.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.965" offset="601349">The Section states that review of three discrete actions that the Attorney General may take, are decision or action to commence proceedings, to adjudicate cases, or to execute removal orders against any alien is available only as provided elsewhere in Section 1252.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.710" offset="676372">The alien selective-enforcement claims squarely challenged the Attorney General's decision to commence proceedings against them and nothing elsewhere in 1252 gives the Federal Courts jurisdiction over their claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.031" offset="725691">Accordingly, judicial review of the commencement of these proceedings is not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.639" offset="748052">The aliens argued that the doctrine of constitutional doubt requires us to interpret Section 1252 in such fashion as to permit immediate review of their selective-enforcement claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.849" offset="796954">The doctrine of constitutional doubt is the venerable principle of interpretation, which says that if there is any ambiguity in a statute, it should be interpreted in such manner as to avoid serious constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.317" offset="846795">Serious constitutional question the aliens assert is at issue here is the deprivation of there constitutional right, not to have the immigration laws enforced against them solely because of there political beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.755" offset="896532">They assert that for reasons, it is unnecessary to go into here, if their constitutional right against selective-enforcement is not assertable at this stage in the deportation proceedings, it cannot affectively be vindicated at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.490" offset="951494">Since this may well beyond constitutional, they say, the statute should be interpreted to permit them to challenge selective-enforcement immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.990" offset="981483">We reject this argument based on the doctrine of constitutional doubt because in our view aliens unlawfully in this country have no constitutional right to assert a claim of selective enforcement as a defense against deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.053" offset="1029757">Even in ordinary criminal prosecutions, the defense of selected prosecution is rarely allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.685" offset="1056297">In deportation proceedings, such a defense would be even more intrusive upon necessary executive confidentiality, while at the same time the denial of the defense does not subject the alien to criminal punishment but merely brings to an end his ongoing violation of the immigration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.091" offset="1125887">We think that an alien whose very presence in this country is unlawful, may constitutionally be deported whatever the reason he happens to be selected for deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.352" offset="1162981">Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment which Justice Breyer has joined in part; Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment; Justice Souter has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
