            <text syncTime="11.974" offset="195946">The Minnesota supreme court has ruled that a person who is present in another's residence for a brief period of time for the sole purpose of engaging in an unlawful business has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.246" offset="240981">This decision, if allowed to stand, would reestablish the automatic standing rule of legitimately on the premises projected by this Court 20 years ago in Rakas v. Illinois, and it would allow visitors to vicariously assert the privacy interests of their hosts.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.820" offset="295316">Furthermore, the Minnesota supreme court's determination that an officer's nonenhanced observations while standing in a public area outside the curtilage of a residence constitutes an unreasonable search is inconsistent with this Court's prior decisions and will expand the exclusionary rule to the detriment of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.246" offset="357070">The defendants here presented no evidence that they were engaged in any intimate activity normally associated with the privacy of a dwelling.</text>

            <text syncTime="69.941" offset="427809">What if the State passed a statute... I remember years ago there was a debate on maybe all defendants should have standing to challenge Fourth Amendment violations, and what if a State passed a statute and said that the defendant shall always have standing to object to an unlawful search or seizure?</text>

            <text syncTime="164.752" offset="807003">I had thought that the Chief, then Justice Rehnquist, in writing the opinion in Rakas, went into this, and said this is not a standing question, or am I incorrect?</text>

            <text syncTime="3255.174" offset="13168772">We do not believe it is part of the record in this case, and it was not considered as such by the Minnesota supreme court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.459" offset="13189879">The slippers worn by Mr. Johns were on his feet at the time he was arrested outside of the apartment, so that does not indicate any connection to the premises.</text>

            <text syncTime="3274.602" offset="13246408">We believe... the record's not clear on that, but he had them... he had those slippers on when he was arrested in his car outside of the apartment.</text>
