            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="151094">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 97 1230, the City of West Covina v. Lawrence Perkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.022" offset="187143">Mr. Lawrence.</text>

            <label>Mr. David D. Lawrence</label>
            <text syncTime="10.506" offset="193099">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="13.241" offset="203966">This case involves the valid service of a search warrant and murder investigation in which the West Covina Police Department lawfully seized 17 items of property which they believed were evidence in that investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.833" offset="262376">The residents of the home, the respondents in this case, were not at home when the home was searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.471" offset="284945">The officers left a notification of the search which provided a great deal of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.625" offset="305530">It stated that the home had been searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.979" offset="314934">It set forth the date of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.139" offset="323607">It provided that the search warrant was issued pursuant to the authority of the Citrus Municipal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.874" offset="346490">It identified the judge, Judge Oki, who had signed the search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.817" offset="362268">It identified two West Covina police officers and their telephone numbers who could be contacted if the owners of the property had inquiries, and it set forth a specific list of the 17 items of property which had been seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.744" offset="418065">Under California law, these police officers did not have the discretion to release that property once it had been seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.750" offset="446069">Penal Code section 1536 required that they maintain custody of that property subject to an order of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.244" offset="476057">Shortly after seizure of this property, one of the respondents, Mr. Perkins, contacted the West Covina Police Department and advised that he was interested in obtaining return of some of that property.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.255" offset="524018">The record is undisputed that when he made that call and when he contacted those officers, that he was advised that he would need to get a court order to get that property back.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.639" offset="561634">The record is also undisputed that he was advised that he would have to contact Judge Oki in order to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.272" offset="584100">The record is also undisputed that at most the respondent, Mr. Perkins, went to the Citrus Municipal Court on one occasion, approximately 1 month after the seizure of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.762" offset="630075">The record shows that he asked for Judge Oki.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.312" offset="644286">He was advised that Judge Oki was on vacation and might be back in a week, and he said that he attempted to find another judge who could release his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.587" offset="677409">He was told that there was no file in his name and that another judge could not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.200" offset="691829">The record is also undisputed that he took no further actions to obtain return of that property.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="140.075" offset="711368">Because he didn't have the warrant number.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.867" offset="722549">And I was wondering why, since you... as you stated, you provided notice that there had been the seizure, why it wouldn't be a good idea simply to have the warrant number on the notice that's left and then we would have avoided this great Federal case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_d_lawrence" startTime="164.641" stopTime="171.975">
            <label>Mr. David D. Lawrence</label>
            <text syncTime="164.641" offset="809589">Justice Ginsburg, I don't believe the record is clear that the warrant number or the absence of it really prevented the respondents from obtaining the return of the property.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="171.975" stopTime="177.849">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="171.975" offset="838950">But whether that's so or not, it would make it easier if you had the warrant number to look up.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_d_lawrence" startTime="177.849" stopTime="224.850">
            <label>Mr. David D. Lawrence</label>
            <text syncTime="177.849" offset="862461">It might.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.041" offset="867163">It might, but the record is really bare as to what those procedures were at the municipal court in terms of locating a file or something of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.244" offset="896002">And in fact, as we submitted, one of the postdeprivation remedies the Ninth Circuit found to be adequate in this case is the procedure of mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.002" offset="931006">Certainly a search warrant is not necessary for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.844" offset="942395">Mandamus is a proceeding that compels a public officer like a judge to do their duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.777" offset="962144">Penal Code section 1540 imposes upon judges who issue search warrants the obligation of returning property to those people if it has been taken without probable cause or is not the property identified in the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.536" offset="1013135">A mandamus proceeding provided all the process that was due to the respondents in this case because they knew the name of the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.871" offset="1038526">They knew the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.659" offset="1041661">They knew the property that... that--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="224.850" offset="1050438">Well, Mr. Lawrence, I... that's all well and good and it may not violate the Constitution to do what the city did, but like Justice Ginsburg, I wonder why the city doesn't want to help its citizens by giving them the information that would be useful, like a correct warrant number.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.323" offset="1120341">I mean, that's very easy to do, and the city's position seems very peculiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.937" offset="1142807">Oh, go bring a mandamus action.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.188" offset="1151793">Well, that takes legal help and all kinds of stuff.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.530" offset="1165167">Now, why doesn't the city want to just supply some simple information?</text>

            <text syncTime="257.802" offset="1182199">--Your Honor, the record does not show that it is a policy of the city not to provide a search warrant number.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.995" offset="1199022">The record in this case is unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.746" offset="1206023">Detective Ferrari in one part of the record said that he believed he did not give the warrant number.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.918" offset="1226712">In another part of the record, he said that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.831" offset="1234340">In fact, Mr. Perkins in his deposition testified that he was given a number, but he felt that it was the wrong number.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.405" offset="1256701">The record is really unclear as to what number was given to Mr. Perkins and whether he received it or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.019" offset="1347084">--But, Your Honor, the record also shows that the warrant number was not the only way to access that information at the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.514" offset="1373102">The record shows that the information was listed not only by the warrant number, but by the address where the search took place and by the date of the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.978" offset="1406957">And the respondents had both of those pieces of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.730" offset="1417928">So, maybe the warrant number would have assisted the respondents in getting their property back, but the record also shows that even after they were provided with that information as early as January of 1994, they did nothing to get their property back.</text>

            <text syncTime="1098.632" offset="4545621">And the point I would like to make is that in a criminal investigation, here a murder investigation, it's not that easy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1131.966" offset="4678950">They had to refile it again in the California Superior Court which has jurisdiction--</text>

            <text syncTime="1150.128" offset="4751571">So, you lost and they give you a little statement, about five lines, that tells you if you want to appeal this, this is what you do.</text>

            <text syncTime="1212.739" offset="5002033">Let's assume it doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.829" offset="5006317">Let's say the prison warden comes into the individual's... the chambers, takes something for some legitimate reason, doesn't leave any notice as to what has been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.114" offset="5043515">That inmate has no Fourth Amendment right, let's assume for the purposes of this hypothetical, but yet the State would have a burden to let the individual know they'd taken something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.401" offset="5072668">And that's why I think it really does have to be procedural due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3361.528" offset="13597154">One, my opposing counsel states that all of us agree that Mullane is the proper test here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.741" offset="13613977">We do not agree that Mullane is the proper test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.154" offset="13623695">Mullane is a predeprivation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.384" offset="13632576">That's a test that's applied to determine whether or not notice is sufficient in the predeprivation context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.429" offset="13656714">Further, in that case, the Court stated that notice is a necessary element of due process when there is a final adjudication, and the notice is to give the person whose property rights are at issue an opportunity to appear and to contest that hearing or to choose not to appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.890" offset="13722647">That is not the case here because we did not have a final adjudication or a hearing that notice could be given up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.674" offset="13745739">My opposing counsel states that they did not get the property back or they could not get the property because they did not get it, and the record shows that even after receiving the search warrant number and even after getting advice of counsel, myself, as to how to get it back, they did nothing to get it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.486" offset="13813030">So, I submit that that's not a very good test to determine whether or not it was possible for counsel or the respondents to obtain the return of their property.</text>
