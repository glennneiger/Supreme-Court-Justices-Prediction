            <text syncTime="8.254" offset="183629">Mr. Avila.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joaquin G. Avila</label>
            <text syncTime="9.789" offset="189794">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.443" offset="216439">The question before you is whether a voting change is required to be precleared prior to its implementation within a section 5-covered jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.865" offset="250085">Section 5, plain language, its purpose, administrative interpretation, and congressional ratification, answer that question in the affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.237" offset="287597">The State of California's statutory construction argument would undermine the broad purpose of section 5 as articulated by this Court.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="41.743" offset="317585">Well, but if it's a fair reading of the statute it has weight in its own right, doesn't it, even if it might be contrary to some earlier decisions of this Court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joaquin_g_avila" startTime="53.718" stopTime="123.981">
            <label>Mr. Joaquin G. Avila</label>
            <text syncTime="53.718" offset="365546">Yes, it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.618" offset="369099">If there's any ambiguity in the plain language of the statute then you would look at, not only at prior precedent, but also you would look at the structure, the overall structure of the act, that is, the interrelationship between sections 4 and 5, and also you would look at the Attorney General's longstanding interpretation of the act, and the legislative history, which confirms Congress' awareness and ratification of that interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.433" offset="464393">And when you look at the focus of section 5, it is on the covered jurisdiction and whether its voting practices have changed, irrespective of the source of the voting change, but the State's construction would immunize a covered voting change so long as a State enacted a superseding statute, even if that statute was never subjected to preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.664" offset="549344">This construction would create what has been described as a loophole the size of a mountain.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.400" offset="568256">Two examples of such loopholes are:</text>
            <text syncTime="106.269" offset="575779">1.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.519" offset="576720">Counties could evade section 5 review by securing courtesy legislation at the State level.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.904" offset="598245">2.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.839" offset="602006">Section 5 review of redistricting plans would be circumvented.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.291" offset="615799">On the other hand, a harmonious interpretation of the statute is achieved by construing section 5 consistently with section 4.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="123.981" offset="646624">Well, the courtesy legislation point, I mean, I guess you have to acknowledge that a covered county can do some nasty things which it hasn't tried to do before by getting the State to acknowledge State-wide legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.923" offset="710362">No?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Joaquin G. Avila</label>

            <text syncTime="142.025" offset="718722">The problem, however, is that the State's argument, if adopted by this Court, would result in major loopholes in the section 5 preclearance provision and, in this particular instance, it would immunize the county's voting changes from section 5 review.</text>

            <text syncTime="161.004" offset="794686">If you appeal the plain language, what do you do when the State adopts a general provision of legislation?</text>
            <text syncTime="168.259" offset="823734">Does each county within the State that happens to be covered have to clear that piece of legislation?</text>
            <text syncTime="174.496" offset="848602">My understanding is that it's simply the State that preclears it and when that happens the county's okay.</text>

            <text syncTime="181.083" offset="875038">If... the focus is on the voting changes that occur within the covered jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.221" offset="899593">If the State enacts a statute that affects voting changes within our covered jurisdiction, either the State or the county can submit either the... the legislation for section 5 preclearance.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.231" offset="955600">--But if you're appealing to the plain language, does the plain language suggest that either the State or the county can do it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joaquin_g_avila" startTime="207.735" stopTime="231.933">
            <label>Mr. Joaquin G. Avila</label>
            <text syncTime="207.735" offset="981618">The plain language of section 5 would suggest that either a covered State or a political subdivision, but, however, the responsibility, the primary responsibility would be on Monterey County to make sure that it submits any voting change, irrespective of its source, when it effectuates a voting change in that covered county.</text>

            <text syncTime="235.052" offset="1090914">Is it the seek to administer?</text>

            <text syncTime="236.737" offset="1097602">Yes, it is, and the seeks to administer refers, in fact, to the act of administering, not, as the State argues, to an administrative act.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.093" offset="1131038">Again, the focus is on the covered jurisdiction and whether its voting practices have changed.</text>

            <text syncTime="307.833" offset="1382023">Well, even if it obeys a command from the State, when it effectuates voting change within that covered jurisdiction it has to be submitted for section 5 preclearance, otherwise you're going to create huge exemptions, especially in States that have... that include covered section 5 counties, like North Carolina.</text>

            <text syncTime="363.087" offset="1603019">In Presley, section 5's broad scope as it relates to election matters was given a very broad scope, and that... and the Attorney General in this case has been interpreted--</text>

            <label>Mr. Joaquin G. Avila</label>
            <text syncTime="419.506" offset="1828717">It is not a cry for a very broad interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.958" offset="1842509">In fact, what we're seeking to do in this case is just merely maintain what's been going on since 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.945" offset="1866437">And that is, when you have the Attorney General reviewing redistricting plans for 1970, 1980, and 1990 from North Carolina, New York, and California, which are States that contain covered counties, when you look at that, and you look at the Congressional Record that's cited in our briefs, you find that in fact in the 1982 reenactment of the Voting Rights Act you find explicit references in the Senate report that say, while... quote, while North Carolina as a State is not subject to section 5, the legislation in question affected North Carolina counties which are covered, and therefore it should have been precleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.237" offset="2019619">And when you look at another page reference, at page 14 in that Senate report, it explicitly refers to letters of objection, which they found to be compelling evidence for reenacting section 5, and one of those letters of objection on page 11 of that Senate report is the 1981 redistricting plan for North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.068" offset="2098927">So we have this history of administrative interpretation and this history of congressional ratification of that interpretation, and so when we... and in addition to that, when you look at the overall structure of the act and the interrelationship between section... sections 5 and section 4, we find even more compelling reasons for maintaining the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.533" offset="2200805">In Katzenbach, this Court stressed the interrelationships between sections 4 and 5, and stated that section 5 was designed to march in lockstep with section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.972" offset="2234555">In Katzenbach and Gaston County, this Court approved section 4's statutory framework which suspended State literacy laws in section 5-covered counties, even though the State itself was not a designated jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.113" offset="2287113">In other words, all literacy tests that were suspended in the covered counties were products of State law.</text>

            <text syncTime="540.868" offset="2314176">Well, one of your arguments is the... what... the risk of what you refer to as the courtesy legislation, that in fact if State law itself is a means to avoid section 5, the usual State capitol log-rolling will simply mean that the counties will get the legislature to enact what they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.466" offset="2400485">Is it an answer to that to say that a line should be drawn between legislation which affects only a covered county and general legislation which in fact affects every county in the State, which I understand is the case here?</text>
            <text syncTime="577.891" offset="2462238">Is the risk sufficiently reduced in the case of bona fide State-wide legislation so that we should dismiss... in a case like this we should dismiss the concerns about courtesy legislation?</text>

            <text syncTime="612.549" offset="2600896">The premise of his question was that there was State legislation which applied to more counties than Monterey, and he said, would that be a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.021" offset="2646767">And then you say, well, this 1979 statute applied only to Monterey.</text>

            <text syncTime="1028.002" offset="4262702">Under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act a covered jurisdiction like Monterey County must obtain preclearance of any voting change that it enacts or that it seeks to administer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.876" offset="4302199">This change... this case involves voting changes that the county seeks to administer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.178" offset="4323411">In every election for county judges, Monterey County oversees and implements the process by which the voters are registered, by which candidates are placed on the ballot, and by which the winners are chosen in the election.</text>

            <text syncTime="1072.966" offset="4442529">Even the entire compliance with the law of another sovereign, the State, you know, put up polling places, that is seeking to administer something?</text>

            <text syncTime="1082.322" offset="4479936">--Yes, it is, and in fact I point to two examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.040" offset="4494774">First, I mean, the court looked at a very similar matter in Perkins v. Matthews, where the State of Mississippi before the Voting Rights Act was enacted had shifted from single member districts to at-large elections, and when eventually the city got around to complying with that State law the court said, the change had to be precleared even though the formal enactment by the higher sovereign did not have to be precleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.424" offset="4600308">Another example, actually that's quite relevant here, is, of course, the literacy tests that occasioned the passing of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.780" offset="4633745">It's quite clear in this case that those tests were mandated by California State law, and they were implemented throughout the State of California at the county level.</text>

            <text syncTime="1160.072" offset="4791002">And in situations like California and North Carolina, a very important example that was ostensibly discussed when the Voting Rights Act was initially enacted, it was clear to Congress that there could be situations where a State... there might be nothing wrong per se with a State law, but the effects that it had in certain jurisdictions did... might have had an effect on minority voting rights--</text>

            <text syncTime="1202.749" offset="4961634">I think that's a... seek to administer is purely temporal, and it should be contrasted with enacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.903" offset="4982323">The way that the statute is written is, if any jurisdiction enacts or seeks to administer something, a voting change, then it has to obtain preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.508" offset="5016700">Now, Congress didn't say seeks to enact, because the legislature can formally enact it into State law without obtaining the approval of the Attorney General or the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.630" offset="5061213">That mean, before it's actually implemented it has to then obtain preclearance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3376.485" offset="13656648">Referring back to a point that was made by Justice Scalia, even a law with a State-wide effect might still have a greater effect on those counties that Congress designated for section 5 purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.960" offset="13702519">As long as the covered jurisdiction is implementing a change, section 5 applies, and that common sense understanding of the term was reflected in the Court's earlier opinion in this case when, writing for a unanimous Court, Justice O'Connor stated that a section 5-covered jurisdiction must obtain preclearance before "implementing" a voting change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.291" offset="13783812">Those were the words used by this Court to describe the operative effect of section 5, and when we look at the administrative practices of the Attorney General in Sheffield, this Court held that the Attorney General's interpretation of section 5 is, quote, persuasive evidence of original understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.883" offset="13850163">So what we're trying to do in this case is merely maintain what's been going on for the past three decennial redistrictings, and when we look at what... in fact, what the State of California and the county administers at the local level, we know that the county administers the election machinery and the personnel that actually administer the State elections, and in our brief we cite to numerous State statutes in which the State mandates that a particular election occur, and that the county is directed to administer that election.</text>
