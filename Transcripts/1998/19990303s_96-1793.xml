            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="85746">The opinion of the Court in No. 96-1793, Cedar Rapids Community School District versus Garret F. will be announced by Justice Stevens.</text>

            <text syncTime="9.737" offset="124616">To help assure that all children with disabilities have available to them, a free, appropriate, public education which emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs, The individuals with Disabilities Education Act, often referred to as the IDEA, authorizes federal financial assistance to States that agree to provide such children with special education and "related services."</text>
            <text syncTime="40.433" offset="247392">This case involves the meaning of that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.166" offset="262334">Respondent, Garret F., is a student in the Cedar Rapids Community School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.553" offset="283859">When he was four years old, his spinal column was severed in a motorcycle accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.284" offset="302876">Although paralyzed from the neck down, Garret's mental capacities were unaffected and he attends regular classes at school.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.504" offset="335686">He is able to speak, to control his motorized wheelchair and to operate a computer with a device that responds to head movements.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.641" offset="368286">Garret is, however, ventilator-dependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.110" offset="378108">He therefore requires a responsible individual nearby to attend to certain physical needs while he is at school, such as, the suctioning of his tracheotomy tube at least once every six hours and urinary and bladder catheterization once a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.169" offset="442370">In 1993, Garret's mother asked the District to accept financial responsibility for the in-school services that Garret requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.889" offset="477269">The District denied the request believing that it was not legally obligated to provide continuous one-on-one nursing care.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.497" offset="507676">And in Iowa Department of Education hearing, however, an Administrative Law Judge concluded that the IDEA requires the District to bear the cost of the requested services.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.685" offset="552397">The Federal District Court agreed and the Court of Appeals affirmed based on our decision in the case, decided about 15 years ago called by the name of Tatro.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.685" offset="592417">The Court of Appeals concluded that the requested services are supportive services because Garret cannot attend school unless they are provided and that the services are not excluded as medical services.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.480" offset="643617">The Court explained that services provided by a physician other than for diagnostic and evaluation purposes are subject to the medical services exclusion but services that can be provided by a nurse or qualified layperson are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.088" offset="710073">The school district petitioned this Court for certiorari arguing that the nursing care at issue constitutes medical services which are excluded from the IDEA's related services provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.106" offset="754167">We granted the District petition but we now affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.410" offset="771304">The IDEA's definition of related services broadly encompasses those supportive services that may be required to assist the child with a disability to benefit from special education.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.108" offset="818115">This general definition is illuminated by a parenthetical phrase listing examples of services that are included within the statute's coverage including medical services if not for diagnostic and evaluation purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.756" offset="876734">Although the IDEA itself does not define medical services, more -- more specifically in Tatro, we concluded that the Secretary of Education had reasonably determined that medical services referred to those that must be performed by a physician and not the school health services.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.342" offset="943085">We referenced the likely cost of the services and the competence of school staff as justifications for drawing a line between physician and other services, but our endorsement of that line was unmistakable.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.752" offset="992717">In this case, the District does not argue that the services at issue considered individually can be excluded from the statute's coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.508" offset="1023751">In fact, all of the requested services may be provided confidently by a school nurse or other trained personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.904" offset="1053322">Instead, the District proposes a multi-factor but essentially cost-based test to determine the scope of the related services provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.006" offset="1089684">We acknowledge that the District may have legitimate financial concerns but the District's test is supported by neither the text of the statute nor the regulations we upheld in Tatro and the District does not explain why characteristics such as cost make one service any more medical than another.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.251" offset="1162722">Absent an elaboration of the statutory term is plainly more convincing than what we reviewed in Tatro.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.269" offset="1190726">There is no reason to depart from settled law.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.397" offset="1203264">Indeed, accepting the District's cost-based standard would create tension with the central purposes of the IDEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.981" offset="1229596">In enacting the statute, Congress intended to open the doors of public education to all qualified children and required participating States to educate -- educate disabled children with non-disabled children whenever possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.239" offset="1286647">We therefore conclude that the District must fund the related services at issue in order to help guarantee that students like Garret are integrated into the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.532" offset="1327816">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.006" offset="1337743">Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Kennedy has joined.</text>
