            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="147160">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 97-2000, American Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company v. Delores Scott Sullivan.</text>

            <text syncTime="11.156" offset="191777">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.891" offset="202644">As you know, in this case there are two questions presented, one having to do with the State action doctrine, one having to do with procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.663" offset="233782">And although my clients could prevail on either of these theories, I'd like to begin by urging this Court to reach both of these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.769" offset="266174">Certainly the Court has authority to reach both because even if the private insurance companies are found to... not to be State actors and, thus, to have no further liability in the case, there do remain other parties in the case, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the School District of Philadelphia, and they are... they are certainly affected by the due process holding in and of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.901" offset="362722">But more important--</text>

            <text syncTime="62.757" offset="398144">More important, from our point of view, is the effect upon the system in Pennsylvania were this Court to leave... to affirm on the State action question but to leave the due process holding of the Third Circuit in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.497" offset="453106">There is a single, comprehensive, integrated workers' compensation system in Pennsylvania that involves both government employers and private employers, both private insurance companies and a government insurance company with exactly the same rules and obligations applying to all of them and, very importantly, with risk sharing among them in the form of assessments that are... that are put into a fund for the purpose of dealing with the... with the risk of providing... of medical providing of unnecessary and unreasonable care.</text>

            <text syncTime="128.713" offset="661981">If the due process question is decided in your favor, isn't the State action question academic?</text>

            <text syncTime="137.802" offset="698344">I do think that the State action question is logically prior, and so I assume that the Court must reach that question first, but in terms of full relief... excuse me.</text>

            <text syncTime="149.060" offset="743379">We have the State... we decided the State action question first because we thought it was prior, but we did not go on to decide the due process question.</text>

            <text syncTime="171.908" offset="834703">So, the Court... the Court certainly has authority--</text>

            <text syncTime="179.062" offset="863333">--Lower courts, fortunately, aren't free to say that, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.466" offset="884962">Well, if I can now turn to the State action issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.668" offset="897815">At stake in this doctrinal question is whether to constitutionalize major aspects of the administration of workers' compensation and other State mandated but not State provided insurance and employment... and employee benefit programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.795" offset="966256">If these issues involve State action, then quintessential questions of regulatory policy that are now decided by private parties subject to regulation by the State will become the regular business of the Federal courts.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael W. McConnell</label>
            <text syncTime="224.959" offset="1046922">Well, Your Honor, in... in Tulsa... an ordinary private citizen, such as the administrator of an... of an estate does not have the power to... to end, to cut off the rights of their creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.468" offset="1108989">That is not something that private citizens can do on their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.504" offset="1125080">In Tulsa, they go to the State and the State provides the active assistance that enables them to accomplish this result, that is, cutting off their creditors' claims, that they couldn't do on their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.228" offset="1168025">In our case, by contrast, private companies regularly withhold the payments to... pending resolution of... of disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.584" offset="1209403">There's no need for government assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.220" offset="1215986">This is something which is done in the private realm on a regular basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.488" offset="1233018">In fact, what goes on in our case--</text>

            <text syncTime="273.457" offset="1240959">So, the distinction is between cutting it off all together and simply deferring payment?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael W. McConnell</label>
            <text syncTime="277.759" offset="1258096">--Well, Your Honor, it has to do with... what the... what the private party can do is withhold payment pending some kind of legal process that comes down the road, which is, of course, the standard practice with insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.601" offset="1313475">If you have... if you're involved in a fender bender and you have a dispute with your insurance company, the insurance company will decline to pay, and then... and you will have some sort of a cause of action against the insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.540" offset="1357256">That is all that's going on in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.642" offset="1365720">In fact, rather than State assistance in this case, all we have is... is a limitation on what would otherwise be the perfectly private right of a private company to withhold payments pending resolution of a private dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.736" offset="1422040">And the Court was very clear in Jackson, as well as other cases, that regulation of private activity does not make that activity into... into State action.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="330.126" offset="1467598">Well, that is true if you focus just on the specific action here, to wit, failing to pay benefits while you determine if it's reasonable or necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.684" offset="1517857">But if you look at the compensation... workers' compensation scheme in a broader fashion, it is true, is it not, that Pennsylvania deprives people of their private State tort action as part of the overall workmen's comp scheme?</text>
            <text syncTime="358.544" offset="1581282">Does that bring this any closer to State action?</text>

            <text syncTime="361.496" offset="1593090">Well, Your Honor, workers' compensation is a substitute for private tort, but that seems to support our contention that this is private action.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.501" offset="1629139">Workers' compensation has a different set of substantive rules, no-fault liability, instead of negligence liability, and has a somewhat different set of procedurals, a streamlined administrative procedure instead of having to go to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.428" offset="1684832">But in other respects, it remains the liability of private employers to their workers for work-related injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.432" offset="1708864">The obligation is not an obligation of the State of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.319" offset="1728404">The obligation is a... is an obligation mandated by the State, but a private obligation imposed upon the employer and then insured by the... by the insurance company.</text>

            <text syncTime="1134.498" offset="4685152">The Government agrees with the petitioners both that the withholding of payments under the workers' compensation scheme is not State action and that even if the insurers were regarded as State actors, the scheme would comport with due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.657" offset="4733740">As to the State action question, in our view the insurance company's actions under the Pennsylvania workers' compensation statute are no different in principle from an insurance company's actions in any other context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.215" offset="4783999">That is, the company gets the claim in order to determine whether it believes itself to be liable for payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.036" offset="4807300">It must undertake an internal process of studying the facts, studying the laws, deciding what its rights and obligations are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.690" offset="4833841">If the company determines that it's not liable for payment, the... it withholds payment, the consequence may well be the triggering of a State adjudicatory mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.879" offset="4874592">And the conduct of that adjudicatory mechanism may well involve considerable State action, but the insurer itself is not a State actor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.401" offset="4904685">And the only difference between the Pennsylvania workers' compensation scheme and other insurance contexts is that a slightly different legal standard applies: fault if the employer's fault is not at issue and, second, the onus is on the insurer to invoke the utilization review process, whereas in the normal context, as... as Mr. McConnell pointed out, if the insurance company denies a claim, it would be up to the... the claimant to file suit or undertake other remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.719" offset="5005936">And I think more generally we could analogize the insurance company to the defendant in any private civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.206" offset="5031953">That is, whenever somebody is sued for money, the defendant will first be required to make an internal determination as to whether it considers itself to be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.311" offset="5068316">It will have to decide whether to concede liability, enter into settlement negotiations, or undertake to defend against the suit on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.501" offset="5101126">But the... the defendant's, the private defendant's, decision to insist upon judicial resolution of the dispute doesn't amount to State action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.857" offset="5138533">Again, the conduct of... the resolution of the lawsuit by courts and juries will involve State action, but the private party who participates in... in the dispute is not a State actor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.313" offset="5180329">And in our view, the mistake that the Third Circuit made was in focusing on the quantity of the contacts between the insurance company and State officials during the URO process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.770" offset="5226200">That is, the Third Circuit pointed out that the... the insurance company is required to file a form with the bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.357" offset="5248561">It will be required to... to file other documents in connection with the URO process itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.578" offset="5269459">Again, the same thing is true of any other civil action between private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.630" offset="5285655">There's extensive connection, interaction between the parties and the court in the sense that they file briefs and pleadings, but the private parties are not thereby engaged in State action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1338.414" offset="5500799">So, we think that the UR itself would be a State actor, but neither the insurance company nor the provider would become a State actor simply by contesting the... the question before the UR.</text>

            <text syncTime="1354.875" offset="5566628">Well, certainly if... if... to take the easiest example, if the doctors on the... if the utilization review organization was composed of people who had a financial interest in the outcome of the dispute, you would have a classic due process violation because the UR itself would be subject to procedural due process rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.420" offset="5640816">Its resolution of the dispute might or might not affect a party's constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.657" offset="5661713">I think what's... what's crucial in this case with respect to the due process issue is that, at least as the case comes to this Court, there is no dispute as to the adequacy of the procedures by which the UR and the workers' compensation judge will make the ultimate determination as to whether expenses are reasonable and necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.118" offset="5739558">That is, the plaintiffs do not contend that the State procedures, at least as modified by the new notice that the State is giving, fail to provide an adequate mechanism for making that determination in the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.510" offset="5789191">Their only complaint is with the withholding of payment by the insurer, pending the UR's determination of the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.532" offset="5817194">And in our view, as... as Mr. McConnell said, that's a practice that is consistent with the way that ordinary dispute resolution typically works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.221" offset="5851989">That is, when a person has a claim against him for money, the usual rule is that the person can withhold payment pending resolution of the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.993" offset="5887098">And in a sense, the... the workers' compensation scheme here is more favorable to the employee and the doctor than the typical rule would be because if the... if the doctor prevails before the UR, if the UR makes the determination that the care is reasonable or necessary, the insurance company is required to pay at that time, even if the insurance company intends to seek further review before the workers' compensation judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.995" offset="5995140">So, the State doesn't even allow the insurer to wait until the final resolution of the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.798" offset="6018337">The State has simply said the insurance company doesn't have to make payment until some neutral arbiter has agreed with the health care provider that particular services are reasonable or necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.004" offset="6059088">The only type of exception to the general rule that this Court has recognized in... is in cases such as Goldberg v. Kelly where a claimant has initially established all the prerequisites to entitlement to a stream of benefits and where State officials attempt to cut off those benefits on the ground that circumstances have changed such that the individual has become disentitled, and in that context, the Court has said that procedural due process protections apply, that there is a deprivation of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.327" offset="6192417">But here, the initial determination that the worker is eligible for workers' compensation, that he was injured on the job and has become disabled does not itself imply any determination as to the reasonableness or necessity of any particular course of treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.503" offset="6257096">So, when the... the UR... when the insurer invokes the UR to determine that question, it's not asking to... for a ruling that circumstances have changed, that something which was originally established is no longer true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.947" offset="6318850">It's simply asking for an initial determination that a particular course of treatment is reasonable or necessary, and in our view that's fully consistent both with the... the typical dispute resolution process and with constitutional due process principles.</text>

            <label>Ms. Loralyn McKinley</label>
            <text syncTime="1561.926" offset="6394814">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.080" offset="6427415">Before I address the legal issues that are before the Court, I'd like to clarify a few things about the workers' compensation system in Pennsylvania and how the utilization review processes actually work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.805" offset="6470360">Workers' compensation in Pennsylvania is a no-fault system which was substituted for the claimant's right to sue their employer for... in tort for work-related injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.660" offset="6509753">It is an exclusive system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.279" offset="6520202">Not only is the worker precluded from suing the employer for negligence or any other common law action that he might have had prior to the passage of the act, but the individual is trapped into the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.670" offset="6561789">The individual is not permitted to go outside of the system to secure medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.455" offset="6576940">So, while utilization is going on, regardless how long that might take... and as the experience of the named plaintiffs indicates, it can take years to be resolved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1621.132" offset="6631588">Once the URO makes its determination and it goes to the ALJ... the URO procedure itself doesn't take years, does it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1636.558" offset="6693341">The utilization review process is part of the State system for the determination of disputes over reasonableness and necessity of medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.795" offset="6722285">The utilization review process is the first step, but if the utilization review organization makes an adverse decision to the claimant, which is made without notice to the claimant and without an opportunity for the claimant to be heard--</text>

            <text syncTime="1702.501" offset="6957073">The Commonwealth has changed its procedures, but there's still an issue as to whether the Third Circuit ought to be reversed based on its due process findings in which there was no notice and no opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.773" offset="6994167">That is what the petitioners have requested in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.308" offset="7004303">The second question has to do with the impact of the request for utilization review and the suspension of payments that results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.545" offset="7033247">Once the utilization review organization makes its decision, it then goes into another aspect of the State system, and during that entire process, from the minute the utilization review is invoked until the appeals are completed, the person is not able to receive medical treatment unless they can find a doctor that can treat them for free.</text>
