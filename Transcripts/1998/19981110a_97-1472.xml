            <text>We'll hear argument next in No. 97-1472, the Michael A. Haddle v. Jeanette Garrison.</text>
            <text>We're going to have to move along.</text>
            <text>We have another case here, Counsel.</text>
            <text>Mr. Stebbins.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles C. Stebbins</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>This case is about whether there is any Federal civil remedy for a Federal witness in the position of my client who was fired from his job of 10 years' standing because he responded to a Federal subpoena, appeared at a Federal grand jury proceeding, prepared to testify as to facts involving a Federal health care fraud investigation.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Would you clarify for us what the status of Georgia law is on the subject of recoverability for at-will employment discharge?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_c_stebbins">
            <label>Mr. Charles C. Stebbins</label>
            <text>Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>Under Georgia law, as stated in the leading Supreme Court case of Georgia Power Company v. Busbin, which is cited in the brief, there is a cause of action for tortious interference with at-will employment which can be brought by the at-will employee for damages against any person other than his employer and those who share the immunity of the employer under State law.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Now, there was a supplemental brief calling the Court's attention to some new case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_c_stebbins">
            <label>Mr. Charles C. Stebbins</label>
            <text>Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>It's my view that that case doesn't illuminate anything about this case whatsoever.</text>
            <text>I'm surprised that it was cited.</text>
            <text>In that case, the Robbins decision... Georgia has a strong at-will policy that the employer can never be liable for discharging his at-will employee.</text>
            <text>In the Robbins case, the employee contended that because he was an employee of a Federal credit union, he had a Federal statutory right to notice and hearing before he was discharged.</text>
            <text>The Georgia Supreme Court found that an employee of a Federal credit union is not an employee of a Federal agency and has no statutory Federal right to anything more than any other at-will employee.</text>
            <text>The case does not change Georgia law in any respect as to that issue.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Could... could this be considered, the loss of job, an injury to the person under Georgia law as opposed to property?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_c_stebbins">
            <label>Mr. Charles C. Stebbins</label>
            <text>Your Honor, under... under Georgia law, the action is characterized as an injury to property.</text>
            <text>However, in general common law among the jurisdictions, as I pointed out in the brief, some jurisdictions characterize this as an injury to the person, others as an injury to property.</text>
            <text>What is the case is that all jurisdictions characterize it as either an injury to person or property, thereby falling within the language that Congress used when it gave a... a Federal recovery under this Federal tort that Congress created for anyone who was injured in his person or property.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>So, if the injury were purely an emotional injury as a result of what happened, would that be recoverable in your view?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_c_stebbins">
            <label>Mr. Charles C. Stebbins</label>
            <text>Under the Federal statute, Your Honor, I'm not sure whether it would be or not.</text>
            <text>I believe the answer to that question would be the same answer that would be given if this were a case premised on Title 7 or section 1981 or section 1982 or any other Federal law that provides for liability for discrimination in employment of some kind.</text>
            <text>Congress is legislating, as the Court has often recognized, against the background of general tort law.</text>
            <text>I think the issue would be whether the emotional damage rose to the level that it would be compensated under ordinary tort law principles.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>You say general tort law.</text>
            <text>So it is important to you that not only would Georgia give relief in this situation, but that, as you say, other States would all give relief.</text>
            <text>Suppose Georgia alone would give relief.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_c_stebbins">
            <label>Mr. Charles C. Stebbins</label>
            <text>Well, I believe, Your Honor, that a Federal tort created by Congress should be governed by a uniform Federal rule of damages.</text>
            <text>It may borrow from State law rules, but I believe when it does so, it should borrow from the general common law tradition as embodied in the laws and the decisions of all the States.</text>
            <text>I don't think it would be appropriate.</text>
            <text>I think it would--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But under the Fourteenth Amendment, generally we look to State law for the definition of property.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_c_stebbins">
            <label>Mr. Charles C. Stebbins</label>
            <text>--Your Honor, I agree--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And why should we not do the same here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_c_stebbins">
            <label>Mr. Charles C. Stebbins</label>
            <text>--Because this section of 1985 is not premised on the Fourteenth Amendment and, in fact, has nothing to do with the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text>This is the teaching of this Court in Kush v. Rutledge; was made explicit in United Brotherhood of Carpenters v.--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Suppose the State of... suppose somebody is injured in... in property which the State of Georgia would not say was his property.</text>
            <text>Are we going to adopt a Federal law of property?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_c_stebbins">
            <label>Mr. Charles C. Stebbins</label>
            <text>--No, Your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>I mean, a particular property is damaged by... by the miscreant under this statute.</text>
            <text>And, you know, the threshold question is, whose property is it?</text>
            <text>You say we adopt a Federal rule?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_c_stebbins">
            <label>Mr. Charles C. Stebbins</label>
            <text>No, Your Honor, I don't say that.</text>
            <text>I would first point out that the chances of such a case arising are very small and they don't arise here--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>So, you acknowledge we look to the State law for whose property it is, but then you want us to create a general Federal law to... as to whether there has been a... been a tort or not.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_c_stebbins">
            <label>Mr. Charles C. Stebbins</label>
            <text>--Well, again, Your Honor, I say this, that when Congress uses the phrase, injured in his person or property, when it used this phrase in 1871, to create a tort, not in the context of the Fourteenth Amendment where we're talking about the adjustment of authority between the State and Federal Government, I believe that the content that has to be given to the term, injury to person or property, in the first instance has got to be drawn from what you might say is the common meaning of the terms.</text>
            <text>Now, I hasten to add that in this case it's not a significant distinction because the Georgia law clearly recognizes that my client had a, quote, valuable property right, end quote.</text>
            <text>That's the Georgia Court of Appeals in Troy v. Interfinancial.</text>
            <text>He had a, quote, valuable property right, end quote, in his at-will employment.</text>
            <text>So, if you refer--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>It's not important to you, but it's important to us.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_c_stebbins">
            <label>Mr. Charles C. Stebbins</label>
            <text>--Yes, Your Honor, I understand that.</text>
            <text>And it would be my contention that although there are difficulties with the idea that when Congress says injured in his person or property, it is not referring directly to State law for the meaning of property.</text>
            <text>The difficulties that would be inherent in taking the other position would be more serious for the power of the Federal Government to operate within its own sphere.</text>
            <text>For instance, if a State should take it into its head to declare that any number of things are not property which the Congress intended to protect when it protected its witness, the State might say that no contractual right is property either, but nobody would buy that because we--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Those people going to get reelected when they--</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_c_stebbins">
            <label>Mr. Charles C. Stebbins</label>
            <text>--Well, I don't know about that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>When the act--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>--Most unlikely.</text>
            <text>I mean, isn't there a significant deterrent for the State to... to modify its... its internal law just to spite the Federal Government?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_c_stebbins">
            <label>Mr. Charles C. Stebbins</label>
            <text>--Yes, Your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>They're not going to do that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_c_stebbins">
            <label>Mr. Charles C. Stebbins</label>
            <text>That's true, but there's also a very... it's very unlikely in my opinion that the Federal Government and the State government will disagree as to what property means.</text>
            <text>What's happened in this case is that the Federal and State governments have disagreed as to who may have a recovery... rather, as to who may be liable for an invasion of property.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, in... in order to get to that issue, why do you look to tort law as such as opposed to going directly to the statute and saying the purpose of the statute seems to have been to protect people from getting hurt for testifying?</text>
            <text>And therefore the injury that the statute must be... must be referring to would be anything that a witness or potential witness would regard as enough of an injury to induce that witness not to testify or to fear that he would be hurt if he did testify.</text>
            <text>And if you look at it that way, you don't look to tort law as such, though tort law may be... be helpful in suggesting things to you, you... you look to the way witnesses are going to be motivated by what happens to them.</text>
            <text>And if you do that, you have a concept of injury which I suppose would clearly cover your case.</text>
            <text>So, my question is, why do you confine yourself to tort law concepts, as helpful as they may be, as opposed to going right to the object of the statute and saying injury should be defined in terms of that ostensible object?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_c_stebbins">
            <label>Mr. Charles C. Stebbins</label>
            <text>Your Honor, my only answer to that is that I agree with Your Honor, and I didn't mean to confine myself to--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Oh, you do.</text>
            <text>So, it doesn't have to be person or property.</text>
            <text>I mean, you... you feel free to invent an object of the statute beyond the words?</text>
            <text>I mean, it says you have to be injured in your person or property.</text>
            <text>I mean, if someone says, if you testify, I am going to break the... break the knees of your... of your son-in-law, would that be covered by the statute?</text>
            <text>Because, after all, it would fit the purpose of the statute, but are you injured in your person or property?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_c_stebbins">
            <label>Mr. Charles C. Stebbins</label>
            <text>--I believe the son-in-law has been injured, Your Honor, and I think he would have a claim.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>That's right.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_c_stebbins">
            <label>Mr. Charles C. Stebbins</label>
            <text>But I don't think you would have a claim.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But I'm the one who... who's being deterred from testifying and either I have a cause of action or nobody does.</text>
            <text>We don't rewrite statutes up here, and... and Congress, when it writes a statute doesn't... doesn't say whatever it takes to... to reach this objective.</text>
            <text>It says we have this objective and these are the limits on it.</text>
            <text>And they have said here person or property.</text>
            <text>I don't know why you can come up and say anything that will... will prevent people from being deterred from testifying.</text>
            <text>You must acknowledge there are some things that will deter people from testifying which are not covered by this statute, like breaking the knees of my son-in-law.</text>
            <text>But if I may interject, I think what you were saying was that anything that hurts the witness would be covered, not that anything that hurts a third party would be covered.</text>

            <text>Yes, Your Honor.</text>

            <text>That doesn't hurt me?</text>
            <text>It certainly does in my person or property.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles C. Stebbins</label>
            <text>--Well, I think that the tort law concepts have got to have some relevance to the inquiry whether there has been a sufficient injury to person or property--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Stebbins, maybe I misread your position, but I thought you were saying the statute could just as well have said injured, any person who is injured, period.</text>
            <text>But that in his person or property was an endeavor to show the breadth of the statute rather than the narrowness of it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_c_stebbins">
            <label>Mr. Charles C. Stebbins</label>
            <text>--That's correct, Your Honor, and I tried to illustrate that by reference to mid-19th century sources to indicate that that was the intention of Congress.</text>
            <text>I cited to Blackstone and to Cobb's Georgia Code as showing that at the time, and for all I know now, all injuries that would be compensable--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But then you simply fall back on how do you define injury.</text>
            <text>Supposing that I'm in the habit of inviting you to go out to a football game and I have seats and you're subpoenaed to go before a grand jury and I say, well, you know, if you go before that grand jury, I'm just going to get somebody else to go to the game this time.</text>
            <text>Now, that might meet Justice Souter's criteria of something that would bother someone a great deal and perhaps induce him not to testify, but is that injury in the light of the statute?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles C. Stebbins</label>

            <text>--I believe it is, Your Honor, but I would like to say that general tort law needs to inform the total phrase used by Congress, which is injured in his person or property.</text>
            <text>I think to... to parse the phrase too closely would perhaps lead to results that were not intended.</text>

            <text>I thought you had agreed with Justice Ginsburg that the reference... in her suggestion that the reference to person or property is there to indicate the breadth of the injuries that may be the subject of this statute.</text>

            <text>I agree it was intended from... from looking at the applicable general background of legal speech that was available at the time, the phrase injured in his person or property was intended to be inclusive of the universe of compensable injuries rather than exclusive or restrictive.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles C. Stebbins</label>
            <text>Your Honor, again this same question comes up, say, in a Title 7 case where this Court has never spoken to that issue, and I believe there's a difference of opinion among the circuits.</text>
            <text>I believe in our circuit, the Eleventh Circuit, the Court generally holds that the extent of compensation available will be measured by what it states vaguely as a reasonable standard.</text>
            <text>Let's suppose that the employer has not been able to prevail on his affirmative defense that he would have fired the person anyway.</text>
            <text>Then, of course, the Court is not going to allow damages to go on forever.</text>
            <text>But this is not an issue that's peculiar to section 1985, part 2.</text>
            <text>This is an issue that exists with all Federal anti-discrimination laws to the extent that they affect at-will employment.</text>

            <text>Mr. Stebbins, you're not only assuming or asserting that... that injury to person or property means general... general tort law, but you're also assuming that it means general tort law as it may evolve into the future.</text>
            <text>Why do you assume that?</text>
            <text>If... if, for example, at-will employment was not considered or any interference with at-will employment was not considered to be a tort at the time this provision was adopted, why... why would I believe that the Congress which enacted this would want that rather minor injury to be sucked into the provision because some future states give causes of action for interference with at-will employment?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles C. Stebbins</label>
            <text>--Well, Your Honor, I have two answers to that.</text>
            <text>First of all, the most direct answer would be that when Congress legislates in this broad manner and says, injured in his person or property, I believe Congress expects and it necessarily follows that this Court and the lower courts, the courts below, are going to develop a law to interpret these broad terms, and that law is going to change over time, just as in the antitrust laws which is the closest analogy in terms of the actual words used where there's a reference to injured in business or property.</text>
            <text>This Court is then faced with the... and the lower courts are faced with the necessity of developing the law as cases appear before it, and that's a necessary concomitant of a common law system.</text>
            <text>But I'd also like to say more specifically I understand the... the... Justice Scalia, what you said about it matters to you all, but not to us, but I do want not to lose sight of the fact that there is no evidence at all that this injury was not compensable at common law at the time or that it would not be compensable under the State law of the State of Georgia to somebody.</text>
            <text>Now, I'd like to reserve any further time I have, Mr. Chief Justice, if there are no further questions.</text>

            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>Petitioner was injured in his person or property because he lost wages when he was fired pursuant to a conspiracy prohibited by section 1985.</text>
            <text>Subsection 2 of section 1985 protects the Federal courts by creating a Federal right to be free of conspiracies to interfere with Federal witnesses--</text>

            <label>Mr. Matthew D. Roberts</label>
            <text>Injury to person or property was a term of art with a well-established meaning at common law.</text>
            <text>It meant a loss or damage that was compensable in a tort suit.</text>
            <text>Nothing in the other provisions of section 1985 or its legislative history warrants a departure from that meaning and, indeed, the limited legislative history on point confirms it.</text>
            <text>In addition, there's no question that lost wages were compensable in 1871 and that they remain so today.</text>
            <text>An employee who loses his job because he's struck by a car driven negligently can recover the wages he has lost, and he can recover them whether or not his employment was at will.</text>
            <text>Petitioner, who was deprived of wages because his employment was terminated by a conspiracy prohibited by section 1985, likewise has suffered a compensable injury.</text>

            <text>I think what's really at issue before the Court is the remedy clause in the third subsection which gives the petitioner a right to recover the damages he suffered when he was fired pursuant to the unlawful conspiracy.</text>
            <text>I don't think there's much of a question that petitioner has alleged a conspiracy that's violated by this subsection 2, clause i.</text>

            <label>Mr. Matthew D. Roberts</label>
            <text>--Because the tort, the wrong, the right that's been violated is the right to be free of a conspiracy that's prohibited by subsection 2 of section 1985.</text>
            <text>The question is whether there's been a loss or a harm that is compensable in tort law.</text>
            <text>Let me... let me try to phrase it another way, if I may, to see if I can explain... explain our position.</text>
            <text>This might be viewed as a Federal tort that's been created where, in order to have a damages action, one of the elements of it is that you prove damages.</text>
            <text>That's what the requirement that injured in a person or property requires.</text>
            <text>To answer the question that... that Justice Ginsburg, for example, asked petitioner, we don't believe that the statute would mean the same thing if it said injured as opposed to saying injured in person or property.</text>
            <text>The in person or property requirement does clarify that it's a broad coverage, but it also limits coverage.</text>
            <text>There can't be a suit just for nominal damages.</text>
            <text>There can't be a suit unless the petitioner... unless the plaintiff alleges that... and proves that he has suffered an injury that's compensable in tort law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Phillip A. Bradley</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>The issue before you today is whether this Court will, for the first time in more than 125 years since the reconstruction era enactments, construe the words, quote, injured in person or property, close quote, to include the termination of at-will employment.</text>
            <text>There are three bases that I would like to review today as to why the Court should not embark on the path suggested by petitioner and the Government which would result in a significant Federal involvement in the employer-employee relationship traditionally reserved to State law.</text>
            <text>Number one, the terms to be construed in this case have potentially far-reaching implications both within the statute itself and in the other reconstruction era enactments.</text>
            <text>Number two, the interpretation proposed by the petitioner and the Government simply is inaccurate.</text>
            <text>And number three, the recent pronouncement of the Georgia Court of Appeals on the issue of whether employment at will constitutes property within the meaning of Georgia law.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>May I just--</text>
            <text>--Mr. Bradley, do I understand from what you just said that, to take the clearest case, the at-will employer says to employee, there's a Federal investigation going on.</text>
            <text>Don't you dare testify.</text>
            <text>If you do, you will be fired at once.</text>
            <text>That's our case.</text>
            <text>And you would say that this statute does not provide a remedy.</text>
            <text>Let's say that the employee testifies and is fired at once.</text>

          <turn speaker="phillip_a_bradley">
            <label>Mr. Phillip A. Bradley</label>

            <text>May I ask you just a question of Georgia tort law?</text>
            <text>I assume that if I run over an at-will employee with my car or if Justice Scalia does--</text>
            <text>[Laughter]</text>
            <text>--that--</text>
            <text>--Gratuitous.</text>
            <text>Gratuitous.</text>
            <text>--that the at-will... that the at-will employee can recover damages for... for lost wages.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="phillip_a_bradley">
            <label>Mr. Phillip A. Bradley</label>
            <text>That's correct, and that goes to the heart of where I think the Government confuses the issue in this case, and that is whether you're talking about an element of damages versus a substantive facet of the tort itself.</text>
            <text>Certainly if Justice Scalia were to run over my colleague, Mr. Armstrong, and he was to lose time at work, the element of special damages of lost wages would be recoverable.</text>
            <text>That doesn't mean that there is property interest in that employment at will, though.</text>
            <text>That's a different issue as to whether or not I have injured something of property.</text>
            <text>The injury in that case was the bodily injury of the person who was run over.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, but from that, it also necessarily followed that the property interest in continued employment was also... was also injured.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>We... we say... I mean, you're quite right.</text>
            <text>In our usual vocabulary we say, well, lost wages is an element of damage or damages, but the reason it's an element of damages is that there is a property interest which in fact has... has been diminished as a consequence of the personal injury.</text>
            <text>So, it's... I... I don't see how you can avoid the conclusion that there is a property interest recognized in the damages remedy.</text>

          <turn speaker="phillip_a_bradley">
            <label>Mr. Phillip A. Bradley</label>
            <text>--But the damages remedy would not exist but for the property... I mean... excuse me... the personal injury that occurred.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, it wouldn't the way the law of any State is... is structured today, but I... it's... it... there would be a lot of foolishness but no illogic, I suppose, in a State's coming along and saying, we aren't going to have any more recovery for pain and suffering, but we are going to have recovery for economic damages in automobile accident cases.</text>
            <text>And you would end up with the same kind of recovery that you get as an element of damage in the... in the case... in the scheme that we all have now.</text>

            <text>Is it your view that the remedy provided by the Federal statute is coextensive what would otherwise be just a State law remedy for either a tort or a breach of contract?</text>

            <text>I guess it depends upon whether it's a reasonable expectation that society is prepared to consider as legitimate.</text>

            <text>--To quote a whole other line of cases.</text>

            <text>At least protected against interference by a third person.</text>
            <text>I mean, there are standing cases where standing is premised on a person's expectation protected by State law that his contract or... will not be interfered with or a business relationship won't be interfered with or a future contract not entered into yet that possibly will come about as a result of this negotiation.</text>
            <text>All of those things are protected often by State law, and I assume Georgia is the same, isn't it?</text>

            <text>Number one, I turn the Court's attention back to the Paul v. Davis case in which the issue was whether or not reputation was property for purposes of a section 1983 deprivation of property action.</text>
            <text>And this Court specifically rejected the notion that it was a... it was property to... anything that was recognizable injury in an ordinary tort suit was property for purposes of section 1983.</text>

            <text>I take it from your answer to my question that you say the word property here does mean what the Fourteenth Amendment provides, in which case your answer to Justice Stevens is it's totally different.</text>
            <text>I mean, I take it that... I have... I set one position.</text>
            <text>The opposite position has the same meaning as the Fourteenth Amendment has, which I take it is your position, and I want to be sure there isn't some fall-back position you have between those two.</text>
            <text>I mean, if... you're right, in my opinion, if the word property means the same as what it means in the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text>So... so, I'm not going to argue that one with you.</text>
            <text>I just want to be sure that that is your argument, and you don't have some other argument that I'm missing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Phillip A. Bradley</label>
            <text>--One of our arguments is that when you look at the Fourteenth Amendment use of property as enacted in the reconstruction era, that that has instructive if not the identical meaning as property is used in this context.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>If... on... on that point, assuming that in fact there... there may be an overriding objective here to prevent people from being coerced against testifying or retaliated against for testifying by conspiracies of people who are mad about their testifying, why would Congress, in enacting this statute, have wanted to leave a whole classification of injuries which in Justice Breyer's sense in human terms are injuries to the witness from coverage of the statute?</text>
            <text>Because that seems to be the consequence of your position.</text>
            <text>If I... if I run over the person with my car or if I... if I get you fired from your at-will job by saying to your employer or two of... two people get you fired by... by saying, you know, Bradley is an embezzler, you ought to let him go, under straight Georgia law, there's going to be compensation for the employee.</text>
            <text>So, there's a... there's a good common-sense understanding that the employee gets hurt and gets hurt in the pocketbook which is a property kind of hurt.</text>
            <text>Why would Congress, in... in wanting to preserve the integrity of the Federal courts by protecting witnesses, want to leave that loophole?</text>

            <label>Mr. Phillip A. Bradley</label>
            <text>First of all, Your Honor, I would point out that there are modifying terms in the statute that involve the use of force, intimidation, or threat which suggest that you're talking about something other than an inchoate interest such as property.</text>
            <text>Number two, if you focus on what the concept of employment at will was at the time this statute was enacted, you must keep in mind that the... that the country was coming out of an era where the employment relationship with the people primarily intended to be protected by the statute was slavery, where the employee was the property of the employer.</text>
            <text>We then shifted into an era that's described by H.G. Wood in the Law of Master &amp; Servant back in 1877 of a pure at-will employment, where the employer had the right to employ, the employee had the right to work, but there was no compulsion between the two.</text>
            <text>One was free to go as to the other.</text>
            <text>That... that type of relationship is discussed and described in this Court's opinion in Arnett v. Kennedy which discussed the Federal relationship of employer and employee.</text>
            <text>And in this era in the late 1800s, it was purely a patronage system where if the employer wanted to keep the employee, that was fine.</text>
            <text>If the employee wanted to leave, that was fine as well.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Okay, but what's the answer to my question?</text>
            <text>Assuming that there is this sphere of genuine harm to the witness or potential witness, why would Congress want to have left that sphere totally uncovered by the statute?</text>

            <text>Mr. Haddle's articulated reason for not proceeding with the False Claims Act action in his brief is that the particular company that was his employer was in bankruptcy, but that doesn't mean that that eliminates his right.</text>
            <text>And in fact, that particular company in bankruptcy ended up generating far more dollars than anybody would have believed.</text>
            <text>He simply elected not to pursue the remedy that was available to him and to try to concoct a remedy out of this old civil rights statute which has never been used to protect employment at will.</text>
            <text>The recent case that we filed with our supplemental brief is Robbins v. Federal Credit Union, and I do think it's an important case for those who may look and say, we are looking to State law to determine whether or not a property interest is involved.</text>
            <text>That case, which was recently decided, you had an employee who was an employee of a Federal credit union, initially took the position that makes me a Federal employee and therefore I am protected by various statutes, but asserted a cause of action for wrongful termination and for tortious interference under Georgia law.</text>
            <text>The Georgia Court of Appeals looked at that and said, we have an exception creating a property interest for public employees when they can be fired only with cause.</text>
            <text>However, with respect to private employees, we are not going to make any such exception.</text>
            <text>We're not going to imply a with-cause requirement, and therefore, for private employees, there simply is no property interest in your employment at will, and there would not be a cause of action under Georgia law for the termination of at-will employment.</text>

          <heading>Rebuttal of Charles C. Stebbins</heading>
          <turn speaker="charles_c_stebbins">
            <label>Mr. Charles C. Stebbins</label>
            <text>There was a substantial impediment to Mr. Haddle bringing an action under the False Claims Act, and it was that the company was in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text>It was not a financial consideration, however.</text>
            <text>I was there and made the decision.</text>
            <text>The fact is that officially Mr. Haddle was terminated by the United States trustee in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text>This was a result of a conspiracy among these respondents, none of whom were the employer, to feed false information to the trustee in bankruptcy who was duped and tricked into dismissing Mr. Haddle.</text>
            <text>Now, I couldn't sue the trustee in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text>He's a... a well-respected member of the bar in Augusta, and my investigation revealed that there was... he had not done anything wrong.</text>
            <text>He was completely innocent.</text>
            <text>So, Mr. Haddle had no way to utilize the False Claims Act in order to remedy this situation.</text>
            <text>Mr. O'Neal did and we recovered a judgment, a verdict which is on appeal.</text>
            <text>Mr. Haddle did not have that available.</text>
            <text>And I would observe that the False Claims Act is a relatively narrow provision and certainly would not provide a suitable alternate remedy.</text>
            <text>To say that witnesses who have an at-will employment and are fired because they have testified in Federal court have an adequate remedy, civil remedy, under any statute that I'm aware of is simply not the case.</text>
            <text>I canvassed the statutes just as widely as I possibly could to find somebody to remedy this injury to Mr. Haddle, and there was no way to do it.</text>
            <text>This brings me to the second point I wanted to make which is that none of the defendants in this case are Mr. Haddle's employer, and under Georgia law, Mr. Haddle had a valuable property right as to everyone other than his employer which is protected by this act as well as by Georgia law.</text>
            <text>And I would refer in response to the question that Justice Souter and Justice Rehnquist gave... asked the Government as to whether it makes a difference if only the employer were the defendant.</text>
            <text>That's not my case, but I would refer to the last words of section 1985 which provide that when there is a proscribed conspiracy, the injured party shall have an action against any one or more of the conspirators.</text>
            <text>Now, I couldn't find anything in the legislative history, but it almost appears to me that this language was put here to abrogate any immunity that the employer might have had at State law.</text>
            <text>That appears to be one of the reasons.</text>
