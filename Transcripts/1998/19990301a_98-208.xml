            <text syncTime="13.260" offset="202888">The 1991 Civil Rights Act made several fundamental changes in the method of enforcing Title VII and the Americans with Disabilities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.627" offset="236325">Section 1981a(a) authorizes awards of punitive damages if punitive or compensatory damages are sought, and either party has a statutory right to trial by jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="40.297" offset="311035">First, Section 1981a establishes several statutory prerequisites which must be satisfied before a jury or, in the case of a bench trial, a judge, is authorized to consider an award of punitive damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="936.994" offset="3897856">This case presents to the Court, in the context of the Disabilities Act and Title VII, very much the same questions that this Court considered under the ADEA in TWA v. Thurston and Hazen Paper Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.406" offset="3955535">This is a case of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.608" offset="3968283">And the statute provides explicitly that in cases of intentional employment discrimination under the Disabilities Act or Title VII, punitive damages may be awarded.</text>

            <text syncTime="966.935" offset="4017602">Well, Mr.... General Waxman, that's quite true.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.278" offset="4027006">But, obviously, looking at the divided opinion of the Court of Appeals, there are several different possible... possible ways of interpreting that.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.312" offset="4067130">And why isn't one possible canon of construction that punitive damages are not favorites of the law?</text>
            <text syncTime="985.307" offset="4091058">This Court has held a couple of times that there are constitutional limitations on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.250" offset="4110911">So, when there is reasonable doubt as to whether they're available or not, the... the Court's answer should be they're not available.</text>

            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="996.784" offset="4137034">Mr. Chief Justice, it is entirely appropriate for this Court, and other courts, to proceed on the assumption that punitive damages are generally not favored in the law, and that, as this Court demonstrated in BMW v. Gore, there are constitutional limitations on the amount of punitive damages that are awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.747" offset="4212893">But in this case, as under the ADEA that this Court considered in TWA and Hazen, Congress has made that determination, and it has explicitly stated what standard the plaintiff must prove before the jury may consider the independent question of whether punitive damages can be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.982" offset="4297739">And I think you were quite right, Mr. Chief Justice... I think it was you... to observe that as... as Judge Randolph did in his concurring decision below, that traditionally, at law, reckless indifference, or reckless disregard, is viewed essentially as a lesser included offense of knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.322" offset="4367120">The reason why there isn't a collapse of what was called the two tiers of liability here, as there was... as this Court found there was not under the ADEA, is that the two tests look at two different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.311" offset="4423127">In order to establish liability for intentional violation, you look at the volition of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.567" offset="4456145">That is, did the defendant treat someone differently on the... deliberately... on the basis of a prohibited characteristic?</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.952" offset="4489687">The further question that the jury has to consider in evaluating whether to exercise its discretionary moral judgment to consider punitive damages is the defendant's consciousness of wrongdoing.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1098.721" offset="4544753">Should it be the consciousness of the company itself or, in this case, the Association, or some lesser employee?</text>

            <text syncTime="1106.856" offset="4577249">Well, clearly, the defendant in the case is the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.582" offset="4604208">And although this Court has never directly confronted the issue, the lower courts are unanimous that individual employees or supervisors may not be sued under Title VII and, I think presumably, analogously, under the Disabilities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.849" offset="4657288">So, in a case, which I... I agree with Mr. Schnapper, is not really presented here because the two officials that--</text>

            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="1142.510" offset="4719878">--I think our position on it, Justice O'Connor... let me first say that, following this Court's decisions in Faragher and Ellerth last spring, there has already developed a split in the circuits, between the Fifth and the 11th Circuit, in cases, both coincidentally involving Wal-Mart, over whether the paradigm that this Court created in Faragher and Ellerth should be directly applied to punitive damages, or whether you should do what the... whether you should start from the place this Court began in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.873" offset="4845370">Which is to say, we know we have to look at traditional agency principles and we have to look at the purposes of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.966" offset="4869716">Now, Justice Scalia was quite right that traditional agency principles apply differently in the case of punitive damages than they do in the case of compensatory damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.802" offset="4913079">In Faragher and Ellerth, this Court, I would say, expressed considerable doubt over whether somebody who was engaging in... an employee or a supervisor engaging in sexual harassment that did not rise to the level of a tangible employment action could ever be said to be acting within the scope of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.106" offset="4986327">And I think that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.586" offset="4992178">But the Court found that a comp... an employer might, nonetheless, be liable because one could say that, with reference to traditional agency principles, the supervisor was aided in the agency relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.863" offset="5041288">Now, at common law... and this is reflected in Restatement... the Restatement, Second, of Torts, 909, and the Restatement of Agency, 217(c), which are identical: An employer is vicariously liable for punitive damages only if the employee acted in a managerial capacity within the scope of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.199" offset="5130627">Now, the... the EEOC, prior to Faragher and Ellerth... and I don't think this Court's opinion changes it any... has taken the position that if a supervisor, vested with the company's authority to hire or fire, fires somebody in an act of intentional discrimination, the company... the jury may consider whether or not punitive damages may be awarded.</text>

            <text syncTime="1541.847" offset="6317213">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.838" offset="6329230">The fundamental difference in perspective between the two sides in this case is that the Petitioner's focus, exclusive focus, on the term "reckless indifference" ignores the fundamental starting point: that this is a statute about punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.610" offset="6392341">And when Congress uses the term "punitive damages" or other terms derived from common law in a statute, those terms, absent a contrary indication by Congress, have the same meaning as they do at the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.858" offset="6441243">And at common law, there were three hallmarks of punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.888" offset="6457439">First, the focus is on the nature of the conduct, not purely the mental state, as the Petitioner says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.455" offset="6479695">Secondly, the conduct is outrageous or egregious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.215" offset="6494741">And, thirdly, the purpose is to punish or... or to deter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.619" offset="6512296">It's egregious conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1594.192" offset="6526611">The... the common law term that we are comparing this to is "punitive damages", or is it the common law meaning of the words "reckless indifference" and "malice"?</text>

            <text syncTime="1605.549" offset="6572064">Because this is a statute that says punitive damages may be awarded under a particular standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.743" offset="6596828">And my point is that if we focus solely on the word "reckless" or "indifference", or the two together, we're losing sight of the fact that Congress was imposing punitive damages for a particular action here, and that... and there is no indication the Congress was meaning anything other than the traditional meaning of punitive damages--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1629.415" offset="6667568">So, your answer would be different, and... and you would... would you concede that Plaintiff is correct, if instead of saying "punitive damages" it had been called "liquidated damages"?</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.660" offset="6708528">And the same thing, a jury may award liquidated damages if it finds the defendant acted with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of the aggrieved individual?</text>

            <text syncTime="1655.701" offset="6772684">Because, for example, in the cases that were brought up before, the ADEA cases, the reference there, liquidated damages for a willful violation, was to a statute... that is, the Fair Labor Standards Act... whereas the reference here is to punitive damages without embellishment, meaning we look to the common law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1879.682" offset="7668580">What it says specifically is the first question in these cases is, was there intentional discrimination, say, on the ground of gender?</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.479" offset="7699822">And, normally, they're defended on the ground that it was a pretext, that it wasn't a pretext.</text>

            <text syncTime="1898.145" offset="7742454">So, you have to establish the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.717" offset="7748723">Once the facts are established, and if the plain... the plaintiff wins on the facts, that means that the person has intentionally discriminated on the ground of gender.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.123" offset="7790310">So, then, there'd be a second question: Did that defendant know that intentional discrimination against a woman is illegal?</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.690" offset="7836599">And if the answer to that question is yes, he did know it's illegal, that's the end of this case; you can assess punitives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.756" offset="7864916">Now, there's a third very rare situation, where the answer to the second question is no, he didn't know; he thought it was legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.362" offset="7899293">I don't know that there's a human being in the United States who thinks it's legal, intentionally, to discriminate against women or on grounds of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.194" offset="7922594">But if we find that human being, the next question would be... the next question would be: should he have known... not just should he have known, but should he really, really have known?</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.501" offset="7959897">That's reckless disregard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3297.670" offset="13340495">I'd like to respond to a number of the questions that have been asked by the Court by returning to the distinction I made at the outset between the statutory prerequisites and instructions that might be given to guide the discretion of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.532" offset="13411966">Section 1981a sets forth two and only two prerequisites: intent, first; and, second, either reckless indifference or malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.567" offset="13452090">We don't think that the courts are at liberty to add a third prerequisite to that list.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.370" offset="13475391">The statute says that if those requirements are met, punitive damages may be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.686" offset="13496603">Now, a number of the concerns the Court raised I think could properly be contained in guidance that would shape the jury's exercise of its discretion, but that's fundamentally different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.982" offset="13537772">To return, for example, to the question put to me by Justice Scalia, Section 909 of the Restatement of Torts contains very specific requirements, under agency principles, for the imposition of punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.040" offset="13586046">None of them are in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.171" offset="13594510">The statute does not say indifference, reckless indifference, intent, and compliance with the principles of the Restatement of agency--</text>
