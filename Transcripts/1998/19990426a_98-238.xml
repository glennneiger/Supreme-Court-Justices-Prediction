            <text syncTime="13.250" offset="197809">The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has the authority to award compensatory damages in the administrative process to redress violations of title VII by agencies of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.256" offset="241800">That authority is conferred by two provisions of title 42 read together.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.759" offset="263847">The first is section 2000e-16, which authorizes the EEOC to award appropriate remedies in the administrative process against Federal agencies that violate title VII.</text>

            <text syncTime="104.632" offset="563315">So in the other statutory instances that you mentioned in your answer to the Chief Justice, I'm curious to know, are there any instances in which the Government is bound and cannot have judicial review of the amount of compensatory damages awarded by an agency?</text>

            <text syncTime="119.292" offset="621933">There are other statutory schemes that are somewhat similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.093" offset="641160">For example, the Federal Employees Compensation Act, which compensates employees who are injured and killed on the job, doesn't have a judicial review mechanism.</text>

            <text syncTime="140.346" offset="706152">Essentially, yes, Your Honor, that Congress made that determination in 1972 when it provided that only employees and applicants for employment can challenge EEOC awards.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="156.665" offset="771458">That's correct, Your Honor, but there were back pay awards and other sorts of awards, including reinstatement, promotion and so on, that in many senses are more intrusive to agencies than compensatory damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.483" offset="818688">Presently, of course, back pay and compensatory damages are both available in the administrative process and the back pay awards exceed the compensatory damages award by a factor of at least three.</text>

            <text syncTime="189.257" offset="901757">The court of appeals construed section 1981a as limiting the Government's waiver of sovereign immunity to proceedings in court in which a jury trial would be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.884" offset="948360">That position is incorrect for at least three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.217" offset="961630">First, the court of appeals' position is inconsistent with the administrative exhaustion requirement of section 2000e-16(c), which is a condition on the Government's waiver of sovereign immunity under title VII.</text>

            <text syncTime="235.870" offset="1088271">Is the EEOC a necessary stop for the employee, or can the employee go upon the agency to court?</text>
            <text syncTime="244.595" offset="1123171">If the agency says no, no discrimination, or discrimination but no back pay, can the employee skip over the EEOC?</text>

            <text syncTime="257.201" offset="1173535">The EEOC is an optional choice, although it certainly is a choice that is made by most employees in the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.676" offset="1199449">For example, in fiscal 1997 approximately 1,000 cases were filed by employees in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.440" offset="1226511">Approximately 7,00 appeals to the EEOC were taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.793" offset="1243961">That suggests that the EEOC is a desirable route for a large number of employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.131" offset="1301326">It might have made sense, but Congress did not say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.885" offset="1312297">Congress didn't disturb the administrative exhaustion requirement, which had always been understood to enable an employee or applicant to obtain full relief in the administrative process.</text>

            <text syncTime="316.981" offset="1412712">Suppose the employee never asks the agency, it just said to the agency, you discriminated me... against me on the basis of sex, and the agency said, and he doesn't specify damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1726.144" offset="7049310">It's our position that this request for corrective action is in direct lineage with the interpretation of the Federal employee section of title VII, which has always held that only equitable remedies were available for either Federal employees or private employees of discrimination until the 1991 act was passed.</text>
