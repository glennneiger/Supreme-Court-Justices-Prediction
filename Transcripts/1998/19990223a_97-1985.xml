            <text syncTime="3165.531" offset="12809304">The government incorrectly suggests that the test we are advocating for whether or not an error is subject to harmless error review is somehow a new test or that it would present new practical problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.624" offset="12869700">The test that we are urging the Court to follow is precisely the same test that it articulated in Sullivan and in Yates: Was... did the jury actually find every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt?</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.467" offset="12925079">That is the question the Court has to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.967" offset="12935006">If the jury did not, then the error is not subject to harmless error review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.454" offset="12952978">The government also places heavy reliance on the evidence concerning materiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.191" offset="12975966">But as this Court has pointed out, when the jury is told to ignore an element, the evidence pertaining to that element vanishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.262" offset="13004178">The jury has nothing to assess that evidence through.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.464" offset="13017030">That is what the jury's instructions are for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.249" offset="13028211">Ultimately, we believe, as the government correctly concedes, not every jury would be required to find that a failure to report income is material.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.974" offset="13075127">That's exactly our point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.926" offset="13082859">It is for the jury to decide, under the circumstances of each particular case, whether or not materiality was established.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.531" offset="13113265">At the end of the day, if the element of materiality is taken away from the jury, no appellate court can declare that harmless for the same reason that a court cannot direct a verdict of guilt.</text>
