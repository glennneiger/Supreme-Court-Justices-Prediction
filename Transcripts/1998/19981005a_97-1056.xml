            <text syncTime="10.128" offset="188651">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="12.739" offset="199100">This case presents three issues under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.472" offset="214042">First, does a union breach its duty of fair representation by negotiating a contract that falsely tells employees they must be union members and pay full dues to keep their jobs when this Court has held, and the union concedes, that neither of those requirements may lawfully be enforced?</text>
            <text syncTime="37.726" offset="299096">The second question is whether the National Labor Relations Board has exclusive jurisdiction over a performer's claim that the Screen Actors Guild, or SAG, breached its duty of fair representation by negotiating a contract that misinforms performers who have been employed in the motion picture industry for 30 days or more that they must meet their union obligations under a union security clause immediately upon hire by any employer in that industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.205" offset="416961">And third, is the employer a necessary party in this case because the plaintiff employee is seeking reformation of the misleading contract provisions?</text>
            <text syncTime="78.212" offset="461055">I will submit the last issue on the briefs today and only address the first two issues, because neither the union nor the employer has opposed our arguments on the third issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.240" offset="501075">Of course, I'll be glad to answer any questions that the Court has throughout any of the three issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.444" offset="517898">The first question is whether this contract breaches the duty of fair representation on its face, because it says that more is required of employees as a condition of employment than can lawfully be required.</text>

            <text syncTime="262.778" offset="1199276">And the NLRB still hasn't gotten around to replacing that model clause, so whatever else this is, how can it be a violation of the duty of fair representation to keep in the contract what the NLRB and the statute say is okay, as long as the union notifies anyone who doesn't want to be a member that, right, you don't have to be a member?</text>

            <text syncTime="289.057" offset="1304393">First, you say that the National Labor Relations Board hasn't replaced it.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.460" offset="1317976">It's true that the board hasn't replaced it, but in Electronic Worker's Local 444 in 1993, more than a year before SAG negotiated this contract with this employer, the board overruled the Keystone Coat clause, saying that it was, in fact, ambiguous and would have the effect of misleading employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.133" offset="1392686">And secondly, with regard to the statute itself, the statute is not just what the statute says, after this Court has authoritatively interpreted it and placed a judicial gloss on it, which as Judge Posner and the Seventh Circuit said actually inverted the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.266" offset="1469277">The employee isn't going to know what that statute means.</text>

            <text syncTime="398.101" offset="1740533">Number 1, under this Court's Hudson decision the union would have had to give her notice of the reduced amount and an opportunity to object to its calculation, which would have been some period of time, typically 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.495" offset="1810123">By that time she would have done the job and she would have been paid by the employer, and then she could have paid the union.</text>
