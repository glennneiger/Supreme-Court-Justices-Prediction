            <text syncTime="11.520" offset="191910">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.172" offset="202463">The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, in this case, declared unconstitutional the President's power to drop from the rolls of the military an officer who had been convicted in a court-martial proceeding, sentenced to more than 6 months of confinement, and who had served more than 6 months of confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.593" offset="280099">Our submission is that this judgment should be reversed for two reasons: First, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces lacked jurisdiction to use power under the All Writs Act to reach the action to drop him, Major Goldsmith, from the rolls and to declare the statute under which he was dropped unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.797" offset="364945">And, second, the statutory power of the President to drop an officer from the rolls is not a punitive criminal measure that implicates the protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause or of the Ex Post Facto Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.615" offset="420220">Now, the jurisdictional question involves a consideration of what powers Congress gave to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces in reviewing court-martial judgments which consist of findings and sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.826" offset="481033">The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces is given a specifically defined jurisdiction to review the results in court-martial cases when particular sentences have been entered and the judgment below has been reviewed by the Court of Criminal Appeals for the relevant service.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.419" offset="555430">The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces is not given free-ranging jurisdiction over all matters that might have something to do with military justice or that might implicate matters affecting service members who have been sentenced under the Uniform Code for Military Justice, the UCMJ.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.400" offset="631394">Rather, Congress has specially allocated powers elsewhere within the military to consider personnel actions that might be viewed as collateral consequences--</text>

            <text syncTime="132.319" offset="675071">Mr. Dreeben, exactly how could the Respondent have proceeded to raise his issue of double jeopardy, and... and before what agency or agencies?</text>

            <text syncTime="142.503" offset="715822">--Justice O'Connor, Major Goldsmith had three avenues essen... essentially, in which he could raise his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.218" offset="742676">The first, which he availed himself of, would be to raise it before the military itself, the Secretary of the Air Force, in response to the notice that he received that action was being considered to drop him from the rolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.568" offset="800041">So he could present that claim to the agency, which in this case he in fact did, along with a myriad of other reasons, both equitable and statutory, why he claimed he should not be dropped from the rolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.504" offset="843822">If the Secretary of the Air Force does indeed finalize an action to drop him from the rolls... which has not happened in this case... he can present a claim to the Board of Correction of Military Records, which is a civilian body within the military service, and has the power to correct military records or to relieve injustice.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.387" offset="927309">And he can, before that body, make a claim that his action... to drop him from the rolls... is constitutionally barred or otherwise improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.695" offset="964508">And most importantly here, he has recourse to the Federal district courts to make a claim that the action to drop him from the rolls would violate the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.552" offset="1004005">There are two different avenues that he could avail himself of.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.574" offset="1016126">One would be an action under the Administrative Procedure Act in a court that had proper venue and jurisdiction to hear that claim, and he could challenge the action... dropping him from the rolls... claiming that it violated his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.783" offset="1076939">He could even, if he had a claim that he might suffer some irreparable injury from the action, seek injunctive relief that would bar the finalization of the action, provided he could make the normal equitable showings that go along with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.276" offset="1134930">Well, what if, in the case of an ordinary criminal conviction within the armed services that's been upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, does a defendant in a situation like that have resort to Federal courts under habeas corpus or something else, or not at all?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="263.396" offset="1199401">Yes, Chief Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.748" offset="1204730">After the conviction has been finally reviewed within the military system, and the servicemember has exhausted other avenues that are provided under the UCMJ to attempt to get relief from the conviction, he can then bring a habeas corpus action under the standard section governing habeas corpus, Section 2241 of Title 28, and argue that his conviction is affected by a fundamental defect that requires that it be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.295" offset="1318937">In this case, of course, Major Goldsmith is not challenging his underlying conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.870" offset="1337223">He is raising a claim that the action to drop him from the rolls is, in effect, another criminal punishment, because it was enacted after the time that he committed his offenses, violates the Ex Post Facto Clause, and because it is being imposed, or might be imposed, after his conviction has become final, violates the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="317.563" offset="1416008">Mr. Dreeben, what about the argument that this relief was necessary to protect or effectuate the result of the court-martial, which was specifically that he not be dismissed from service?</text>
            <text syncTime="330.661" offset="1468462">That was an option that they had and that they didn't impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.963" offset="1481628">So, why isn't this a legitimate means of protecting the judgment that there be no dismissal?</text>

            <text syncTime="341.928" offset="1513497">Justice Ginsburg, we don't dispute that the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces has, in appropriate circumstances, the power to rely on the All Writs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.395" offset="1551322">But the All Writs Act itself is not generally available to do service when there are other provided statutory means of accomplishing the end in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.233" offset="1598761">Here, the standard, typical means of raising any kind of a double jeopardy defense is to set up that defense as against the action that is brought against you.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.171" offset="1642437">And so long as there are adequate means of raising that claim, there can be no warrant for using the All Writs Act to circumvent the specifically provided means that Congress has allowed for the raising of this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.030" offset="1697921">The All Writs Act is an equitable power.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.370" offset="1707221">If there is an adequate remedy at law, there can be no resort to equity.</text>

            <text syncTime="409.756" offset="1784752">It's significant here because it signifies that that is where Congress intended that servicemembers go, within the military, to obtain relief from adverse personnel actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="628.331" offset="2659123">That is, if you see this action as a punishment, it would make sense to say that the... the criminal court has jurisdiction, through the All Writs Act, to stop some other part of the Army from... let's say they explicitly said, And we're going to punish you some more by making you do extra duty, making you do this, making you do that, dropping you from the rolls... I guess they might have jurisdiction there.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.550" offset="2775943">But if you don't see it as a punishment, you rather see it is as a consequence or some kind of other general action, then, of course, they wouldn't have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.876" offset="2817321">But, I mean, looked at that way, you have to decide the merits in order to decide if they have the jurisdiction.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="932.462" offset="3875593">There... there are a number of legal and practical differences, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.965" offset="3893670">The first and central one here is that the action of a court-martial in dismissing an officer is considered to be about the worst punishment that a court-martial can impose, about the worst punishment that can be experienced by an officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.122" offset="3950303">It carries the stigma of having been taken out of the military service as a punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.158" offset="3978411">And so it is a punitive measure, and designed to be perceived as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.670" offset="3996488">The action of dropping from the rolls, in contrast, grew up from the history of a law in the 18... enacted in 1870, that permitted the President to simply recognize that if an officer were AWOL, absent without leave, and not serving any services for the military, not performing any work for the military, he could be simply dropped from the rolls without characterization of how he left the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.616" offset="4100246">A dismissal is roughly equivalent to a dishonorable discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.809" offset="4112994">Dropping from the rolls is simply a removal from the military without characterization of the service experience at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.605" offset="4148207">The intermediate form of administrative remedy, which is a proceeding under Section 1181, is more broadly available for misconduct or dereliction of duty or conduct that is inconsistent with the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.454" offset="4207557">And it entails a full-blown due process hearing, at which the servicemember can present to the armed forces reasons why he should not be dropped... why he should not be dismissed from the... the military or discharged from the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.703" offset="4256563">And it can carry adverse consequences, adverse characterizations, for the servicemember who is discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.817" offset="4289059">So, it has both more due process, more potential for adverse characterization, than dropping from the rolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.874" offset="4313301">Dropping from the rolls really targets a very narrow category of servicemembers who have been convicted of serious crimes or who are AWOL.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.969" offset="4345693">And in those situations, Congress has deemed it to be a sufficient basis, alone, for removing that person as a serving member of the military.</text>

I think that if the Court held clearly, as... as it should, that the dropping from the rolls procedure is a civil and administrative remedy, that would reinforce the conclusion that it could not possibly be a matter that could ever come before the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.606" offset="5352243">But even if the Court did not decide that question, and addressed first the jurisdictional question, the issue here is fundamentally who has authority to decide whether the administrative action of dropping from the rolls does implicate criminal punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.523" offset="5411907">In our view, that responsibility falls to the military bodies assigned for that responsibility and to the Federal district courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1324.410" offset="5443463">Mr. Dreeben, there was... the reason given for going the CAAF route rather than the more lengthy military district court or claims court was the illness of Goldsmith.</text>

            <text syncTime="1345.274" offset="5526846">Yes, he is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.074" offset="5534055">He has been, as a result of the order of the CAAF, not discharged from the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.789" offset="5560909">And because his sentence has expired, he has returned to active duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.260" offset="5578777">The manner in which the case came to the CAAF is significant because it reveals that the CAAF entertained not only the action to drop Major Goldsmith from the rolls, but it also entertained an action that he was not being given appropriate medical treatment while in military confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.585" offset="5664145">And the issue of what kind of medical treatment a prisoner is being given has nothing to do with the findings and sentence of the court-martial that confined him to custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.452" offset="5707613">Normally, challenges to the way in which someone is being held under a judgment are brought in a Federal court or through administrative procedures... proceedings that are made available for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.829" offset="5749095">It is not a continuing source of jurisdiction for the CAAF over all actions administering sentence simply because it once had power, which in this case it never even exercised, to review the sentence in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.707" offset="5804579">And a further indication of how far the CAAF has gone from reviewing court-martial sentences is that it issued an injunction not only against the Secretary of the Air Force and subordinate officials not even to proceed with the duty... the dropping from the rolls procedure... its injunction actually issued to the President of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.740" offset="5880752">And it is clearly something that is rather extraordinary to suppose that an Article I court, which has no specific jurisdiction at all to review this kind of personnel action, could issue an injunction against the President that would prevent him from removing from military service an officer who has been convicted of disobeying orders and committing assaults that were likely to re... lead to grievous or serious injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.115" offset="5978241">If the Court has no further questions, I would save the rest of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3171.009" offset="12829846">I don't want to speak too broadly on that, because there is actually authority of the JAG to reduce a sentence even after it has been affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.835" offset="12869134">And so, to a large extent, you really have to understand that the CAAF's authority is limited to ensuring fair rights under the UCMJ for the court-martial sentences that are brought before it for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.201" offset="12914588">And thereafter, other bodies in the military and other bodies in the Federal court system have responsibility for adjudicating the constitutional and statutory claims that servicemembers might render.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.488" offset="12959727">And I don't think that that's terribly different from the civilian courts, but it should be reinforced by an additional principle here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.584" offset="12988148">The purpose of military justice is to reinforce discipline and order within the military system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.058" offset="13009987">And there are a whole host of jurisdictional and statutory bases within the military for maintaining discipline, of which the CAAF and the UCMJ are just one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.465" offset="13047603">Congress divided up the world in the way that it did and assigned responsibilities to various bodies within the military and to the Federal courts outside the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.669" offset="13084488">And the... the CAAF, in this case, has not adhered to the firewalls that were put on its jurisdiction, but has reached out to review actions by other parties under the military that are really to be reviewed elsewhere.</text>
