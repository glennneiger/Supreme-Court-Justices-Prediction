            <text syncTime="88.908" offset="508202">Ownership of the real estate was left in the hands of 203 North LaSalle Street Partnership, despite its default on the loan, in exchange for a promise to contribute 4.1 million dollars net present value of new value into the estate over 5 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1013.832" offset="4207872">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.461" offset="4282373">Because Respondents concede that they received property under this reorganization plan, the only question presented under the governing text of the absolute priority rule is whether they received that property, quote, on account of their prior equity interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.886" offset="4340156">We believe they did for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.905" offset="4348202">First, the ordinary meaning of the phrase "on account of" requires an inquiry into causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.476" offset="4374429">The absolute priority rule, thus, asks whether there is a causal nexus between the prior junior equity interest and the retentions of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.265" offset="4409642">That causal nexus is clearly present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.217" offset="4425420">Under the reorganization plan, the junior partner... the junior interests, the partners, and only those partners, were allowed to receive interest in the reorganized debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.275" offset="4469723">Now, Justice Scalia, you asked about whether that was in fact an option under the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.845" offset="4487905">And under... under section 5.2 of the plan, which is at the Joint Appendix, pages 38 through 39, section 4.5(d), which is also at Joint Appendix, page 38, it says clearly that the decision whether or not to make a payment to purchase this new equity interest will be made 2 business days after confirmation of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.242" offset="4569511">And then, the default provision of the plan, section 6.1, which is Joint Appendix, page 46, says what will happen if the contributions aren't made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.265" offset="4605665">This previous position... previous provisions that I cited also address what happens to people who do not exercise the options.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.169" offset="4633250">So we think that's clearly under the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.537" offset="4642759">And, in addition, it's important to understand what the concept of the under plan means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.655" offset="4659163">It's... it's much like under... under law, the authority... there was no authority to have this option or to acquire interest without a plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.928" offset="4692287">So we believe it was clearly under the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.463" offset="4702422">Under the plan, no one... no one else could acquire these ownership interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.534" offset="4726664">Thus, there was a 100 percent certain... certainty, excuse me... that partners, because they were partners, because they had junior interests--</text>

            <text syncTime="1481.717" offset="6079389">But in addition, another thing the absolute priority rule does... remember, we're in a reorganization, where this entity is going to continue, many times in cooperation with its creditors, and the creditors have a right to limit the ability of the equity holders to stay in control of that reorganized debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.663" offset="6151173">And then to... especially in a manner that's going to benefit themselves, to set their own price for new equity interests to exclusively and completely take control of the enterprise while forcing a bank, Housing and Urban... the... the Department of Housing and Urban Development, or another senior creditor into long-term, unwanted financial relationships solely to benefit the junior interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="1627.946" offset="6664323">The bank did propose a plan of reorganization here, or asked to propose a plan of reorganization, which was a plan of liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.403" offset="6702148">It's really not correct for the bank to stand up here and say they were proposing to put in money, when their plan was a plan of liquidation that did not propose to put in 6 million dollars or any lesser sum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.842" offset="6743944">It was a proposed plan of liquidation that was defective on its face because it didn't satisfy the best interest of creditors test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.413" offset="6770275">And that's why the court properly denied the bank's motion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1793.686" offset="7327310">And it was that ability to defer the taxes, not to avoid taxes, but to defer the capital gain, that ability to defer was the economic incentive for the investors to put money in.</text>

            <text syncTime="1822.770" offset="7443607">But it's... it's important to point out and to understand what the confirmation process is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.091" offset="7464923">Section 1121 of the Bankruptcy Code gives the debtor the exclusive right to file a plan for the first 120 days of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.363" offset="7498047">That is clearly a valuable right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.315" offset="7505883">It's a right to set the agenda, to set the option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.548" offset="7514765">It's like... somewhat like writing the first draft of an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.035" offset="7528662">Congress recognized that's a valuable right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.071" offset="7544858">And in fact, the bank, in its amici, recognized it was a valuable right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.439" offset="7558337">Because in 1978, when this particular section was being debated, the creditor... the secured creditor lobby, which is here today, lobbied to do away with debtor exclusivity altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.931" offset="7604313">Congress decided not to do that and instead to have a compromise, where the debtor got an exclusive right, for the first 120 days, which could be shortened for cause shown... if somebody came in and said, I... here are the following circumstances, and I believe that they... they demonstrate cause for terminating the exclusive period, the bankruptcy court has discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.660" offset="7683203">Once a plan is filed, Section 1123(a)(5) says that the plan must specify the means of implementation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.766" offset="7719670">That means a plan has got to say where the money is coming from to make the payments required under the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.004" offset="7740567">The Code, in various subparagraphs, lists examples of means of implementation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.258" offset="7773586">And one of them, in subparagraph (J), is the sale of the securities of the debtor for cash or in exchange for claims or other interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.382" offset="7818099">If Congress had meant to limit the debtor's discretion in what kind of package it was going to put together in an offer to the creditors for a restructuring, it easily could have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.587" offset="7862925">It could have said you've got to specify means of implementation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.241" offset="7881524">You can sell the securities, but if it's the debtor proposing a plan, you must do it by way of auction or you must cut other people in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.295" offset="7905766">It simply didn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.080" offset="7912871">What Congress decided was that if creditors or other parties and interests didn't like the plan and, instead of simply objecting to it, wanted to propose a different plan, they had an obligation, under Section 1121(d), I believe, to come in and ask the court to terminate exclusivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.709" offset="7983402">And if the court terminated exclusivity, both plans, if there was a proper disclosure statement, would go out to the creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.628" offset="8015062">The creditors would vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.064" offset="8020809">And if both plans were accepted and if both plans met all of the requirements of 1129, then the bankruptcy judge, in 1129(c), is required to decide between those plans, and choose one based on the preferences--</text>

            <text syncTime="2116.511" offset="8618595">What that means in the context of a reorganization is that a senior class of creditors that has not been paid in full gets first claim on all of the reorganization value of the company.</text>

            <text syncTime="2800.320" offset="11353825">The earlier cases addressed the problem of whether the unsecured creditors are getting all of the reorganization value of the company or whether something is being diverted to a junior class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.611" offset="11398964">The change in the Bankruptcy Code doesn't affect that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.246" offset="11413593">What... what we have now is, instead of under... as under old Chapter 10, the right of an individual creditor to object, now it has to be by classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.935" offset="11448283">But as somebody pointed out earlier, the absolute priority rule only comes into effect if you have one class that agrees and one class that disagrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.874" offset="11480048">So the analysis that you go through with respect to the disagreeing party... whether that party is an individual creditor or class... is exactly the same under the Code as it was under Chapter 10 and, indeed, under the Federal equity receivership proceedings that existed even before Chapter 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.986" offset="11548489">The change, quite simply, has no effect on the content of the absolute priority rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2865.262" offset="11613586">An option existed in the case that we cited in our brief, Consolidated Rock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.399" offset="11630200">There, the plan said the old owners are getting an option, and they're not paying anything for it.</text>
