            <text syncTime="43.420" offset="325223">Rather, as applied here the effect of the 1996 act is simply to reaffirm the generally applicable rule that the filing of administrative charges is not a final agency action subject to immediate judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.679" offset="374229">Indeed, if respondents have identified no case, either in the immigration context or otherwise, in which a court has entertained a constitutional challenge to an agency's decision to commence administrative proceedings.</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="252.017" offset="1159574">--Well, the only... the basis for... if you look at page 1a of the appendix to the Government's brief, former section 1105a(a) was... it's entitled generally Judicial Review of Orders of Deportation and Exclusion, and it says, Exclusiveness of Procedure, and then it says, the procedure prescribed by and all the provisions of chapter 158 of title 28, which is the Hobbs Act, says, shall apply to and shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for the judicial review of all final orders of deportation heretofore or hereafter made against aliens within the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.924" offset="1323205">And as the legislative history of the 1961 amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act make clear, that provision was enacted in 1961 to replace a former system under which multiple avenues of review had been available for challenge by orders of deportation.</text>

            <text syncTime="321.856" offset="1438980">I would assume that would address the situation in which the alien challenged the detention itself, perhaps because it was prolonged, rather than challenging the validity of the final order of deportation, because as I say the legislative history of the 1961 amendments to the INA indicate that the provision for Hobbs Act review in the court of appeals was specifically intended to replace prior duplicative avenues of review.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="347.100" offset="1539917">It's very bad English if that's what it means, because it says any alien held in custody pursuant to an order of deportation may obtain judicial review thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.639" offset="1582026">Now, that thereof refers to an earlier noun, and the only earlier noun available is order of deportation.</text>

            <text syncTime="364.834" offset="1610865">I think that is correct looking at that provision in isolation, but I think that provision is viewed in conjunction with (a)(1), which says specifically that judicial review in the court of appeals under the Hobbs Act is the only means of challenging the final order of deportation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.502" offset="1673559">And again, one of the things I'd emphasize is that uncertainty as to what precisely would be the proper avenue for reviewing the final order of deportation really shouldn't distract the Court from the question of whether the instant suit was properly commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.594" offset="1737925">That is, even though there might be some disagreement between the parties as to precisely how a judicial review of the final order would be carried out, I think there is a common agreement that final orders of deportation are judicially reviewable.</text>

            <text syncTime="409.804" offset="1790692">Well, to the extent that we have to give meaning to a statute that is certainly ambiguous in part as to how it works in the interim, period, if no review is available of these constitutional claims, that might influence our interpretation of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="432.928" offset="1883270">It might influence... I think to take a worst case scenario from the Government's standpoint, if the Court believed that Congress had unambiguously foreclosed all judicial review of respondents'... of selective enforcement claims either before or after the entry of a final order, and if the Court held that respondents were constitutionally entitled to judicial review so that the deprivation of all review would be a constitutional violation, the Court would then have to determine what the proper remedy was, and we would submit that it is much more consistent with the overall scheme of the immigration statute and with general principles of administrative law that review be provided at the end of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.354" offset="2040945">Again, we're not asking for a special rule for immigration cases, but just--</text>

            <text syncTime="519.576" offset="2229863">Certainly, if the Court wrote an opinion saying that the instant suit was barred based on its reading of the statute to allow a judicial review at the end of the day, the Court's opinion would give the respondents the necessary assurance that review would ultimately be available, whatever the binding effect of my representation might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.319" offset="2304782">And again, the other point I want to make is, if it... if the Court at the end of the day concluded that section 2347(b)(3) simply was unambiguously unavailable to the aliens, and that there was... and if the Court further concluded that the aliens were constitutionally entitled to judicial review of their selective enforcement claims such that a denial of fact finding would be a constitutional violation, the obvious remedy would be for the Court to fashion an appropriate mechanism similar to the section 2347(b)(3) transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.520" offset="2433618">That seems to us a remedy for a hypothetical violation that is far more in keeping, again, both with the overall structure of the immigration laws--</text>

            <text syncTime="1640.540" offset="6713625">The Government in this case admittedly targeted plaintiffs for core political activity such as distributing magazines, belonging to a group, and donating funds to that group's lawful activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.888" offset="6763048">It did so avowedly for the purpose of disrupting those political activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.843" offset="6782901">It now contends that plaintiffs cannot obtain a judicial ruling on whether they have a First Amendment right to engage in these activities for the entire period of time that it takes the deportation process to run its course, even though the deportation process cannot address their First Amendment claims, nor develop the necessary facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1702.873" offset="6963042">The ostensible basis is that one student took too few credits when he was in school, another worked without authorization when he was in school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.027" offset="6987597">The Government, when they brought the charges, when they brought these technical charges said... had a press conference to say, we don't care what the technical charges are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.562" offset="7021765">We want to deport them because they're associated with the PFLP.</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="3378.744" offset="13666480">I guess the first legal point I would want to make is that we certainly disagree with the contention that prior to the enactment of the 1996 statute there was a consistent practice of allowing claims like this to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.332" offset="13712874">The respondents have not identified any case in which a court has entertained a selective enforcement challenge to the filing of deportation charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.698" offset="13742340">That would have been inconsistent with well established principles of administrative law that the filing of charges is not final agency action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.032" offset="13767626">Cases like Cheng Fan Kwok are cases in which the Court has reviewed actions that took place outside the deportation process itself and has held that those were not subject to the exclusive review provision of former section 1105a, but to say that simply by challenging a nonfinal action an individual can have his claim heard immediately really is not consistent with administrative law principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.838" offset="13854875">The second point is that what is revealed pervasively in the FBI reports is a concern that the respondents were assisting in the raising of funds for a foreign terrorist organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.126" offset="13896044">Certainly, in the course of surveilling the respondents the FBI came upon other PFLP related activity other than the pure raising of funds, but the court concern was with fundraising, so this is very far afield from core First Amendment activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.255" offset="13956544">And the last point I'd like to make is that for respondents to claim that they have attempted at every turn to seek expeditious resolution of this process is simply untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.482" offset="13993429">The respondents have sought repeatedly to get district court injunctions against the ongoing deportation proceedings, they have sought successfully to have stays entered in the immigration court itself to have the proceedings put on hold until the conclusion of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.773" offset="14050585">There's nothing wrong with their doing it, but I think the respondents have acted throughout the proceedings on the assumption that their clients' interests are served by protraction of the proceedings rather than by speedy resolution.</text>
