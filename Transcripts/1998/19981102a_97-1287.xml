            <text syncTime="14.191" offset="201165">The nub of this case, I believe, is that the post termination surplus asset allocation rules buried in section 1344(d) of ERISA cannot become the tail that wags the rest of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.592" offset="258739">Those rules do not create an entitlement that restricts the legitimate uses to which surplus plan assets, or any plan assets, can be put, but that is how the respondents would have it in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="126.937" offset="652143">I think the general trend is to move towards defined contribution plans, and also to move away from contributions to defined benefit plans, and I think the reason for that is as a general sense today that employees want to invest their own money.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.219" offset="1197266">But I think the point is is that 1) we're not bound by colloquialisms like that, and second, people say new when they mean amended all the time, and the case can't turn on that.</text>

            <text syncTime="290.988" offset="1308339">I would still, if you're going to participate in this plan, they would be mandatory contributions, and therefore under section 1053 and 1054 you would only vest in your contributions plus the statutory interest rate and not in all the upside, and anything else, Your Honor, transforms this plan and any other defined benefits plan into exactly what Justice O'Connor pointed to, which is a defined benefits, defined contribution floor, a benefits floor with a defined contribution upside, and that really I think wrecks the basic dichotomy that is in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="341.283" offset="1509482">Justice Ginsburg, I think it's quite common.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.445" offset="1518154">In fact, I think it's the usual amendment these days.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.776" offset="1527454">I know in this case it's the same way that the union plan went, that the employer and the union in the bargaining plan... remember, we have the nonbargaining plan here.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.090" offset="1560786">In the other plan, the union and the employer agreed to go from a contributory structure to a noncontributory structure, and again, I think it's because it's a sense by employers that they want to give employees some choice in how to invest their money, and at least when the stock market was doing well, that employees had a lot of other options that they wanted to avail themselves of.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.665" offset="1646990">Whether in light of the last, you know, 6 months, people are still going to be doing that, is another question, but that just shows you that there could have well been a downside here.</text>

            <text syncTime="403.794" offset="1759526">Justice Ginsburg, there's... certainly to say that the... the answer is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.579" offset="1786693">The... to say that the employer is not a fiduciary in amending the plan is not to say that the employer has discretion to do whatever he wants, whatever it wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.346" offset="1829743">The employer is still bound by the substantive provisions of ERISA that apply whether or not one is a fiduciary, which we would concede include the anti inurement provision here, and also the vesting and nonforfeitures, forfeiture provisions and the asset distribution provisions, so to say that one is not a fiduciary here just means to say that the amendment must comply with the rest of ERISA, but... and to say but there's no broader duty that exists out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.465" offset="1942278">And of course, if there were a broader duty to plan participants it would be a sort of, a hopelessly conflicting situation, right, because the employer would be under conflicting fiduciary duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.283" offset="1977491">When we're deciding how to structure the benefit program for active employees and retired employees, to whom do we owe the fiduciary duty.</text>

            <text syncTime="470.291" offset="2025557">You can't have that sort of conflicting fiduciary duty, which is one of the reasons why this Court held in Spink that in designing a plan or amending the design of a plan the employer is acting as a plan sponsor.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="580.845" offset="2467758">So basically, to use a term that has come up in the briefs, I guess the only real difference between this and an insurance policy is the consequence on dissolution, on termination.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul T. Cappuccio</label>
            <text syncTime="592.726" offset="2515300">Well, I guess I'd be somewhat hesitant to say it's exactly the same, Justice Souter, because, of course, an insurance policy is not backed up by the Government, as this is here, and there are other restrictions that ERISA places on the use of funds that I believe are not on an insurance company, but with those qualifications it would be similar, that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.799" offset="2607565">Let me address just briefly the nonfiduciary claims brought by the respondents, the claims that do not depend on a fiduciary duty, the anti inurement vesting and post termination asset distribution claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.200" offset="2681126">We go over in the briefs that these fail for a variety of reasons, but I'd like to focus the Court today on I think what the one silver bullet is that will kill every one of those claims without having to decide anything else, and that is the one plan, two plan issue, for unless the respondents can defend the holding by the court of appeals that it's an open question of fact whether there is one plan or two plans here, then all of their claims implode.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.857" offset="2787810">Because, of course, if there's one plan here there can't be any anti inurement violation, if there's one plan here, even if you let them prevail on their ambitious duty to terminate claim, there can't be a wasting trust, because people are still coming into the plan, and they're vesting and forfeiture claim would also fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.450" offset="2862207">Now, the court of appeals held that it was a disputed issue of fact whether it was one plan or two.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.003" offset="2884358">It is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.504" offset="2886344">That is, as Judge Norris pointed out in his dissent, an erroneous conclusion of law disguised as a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.190" offset="2917168">The relevant facts in this case are undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.092" offset="2928767">They are, what are the particular changes that Hughes made to the plan, and the fact that at least on the face of the documents those changes are structured as an amendment rather than as a second, separate plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.080" offset="2976727">Framed correctly, the relevant legal question becomes, is there anything in the law that prevents Hughes from structuring the transaction the way they did, and deems what Hughes did two plans as a matter of law, and the answer to that is plainly no.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.002" offset="3048407">Respondents have not pointed to anything in ERISA or anywhere else that would limit... that would prevent Hughes from doing this as an amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.520" offset="3090412">By the way, these are always done as amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.090" offset="3096786">All one has to do is look at the plan in this case to see that it's a series of about six amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.684" offset="3115072">And to the contrary the Government has at least two regulations on point that specifically allow a single plan to have multiple benefit structures.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.831" offset="3155718">The Department of Labor has a regulation to that effect, and the IRS has a regulation to that effect, both of which are cited in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.378" offset="3185916">Indeed, the same IRS regulation that allows multiple benefit structures says that a plan is a single plan when on an ongoing basis all of the plan assets are available to pay benefits to employees who are covered by the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.076" offset="3240669">In other words, is there a single pool of assets?</text>
            <text syncTime="776.998" offset="3252371">I will defer to the Solicitor General's Office on the reasons for the single asset test, but I believe them to be that the Government thinks it's important to focus on a single pool of assets for purposes of determining whether the minimum funding requirements, which are the real protection in ERISA, are met in any case and also, I would suppose, that the single pool of asset test furthers the important Government interest by encouraging employers to do just what we did here, which is to have multiple benefit structures with one single pool of assets and thereby pool and reduce risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.842" offset="3395731">But in any event, whatever the reasons for that, it's a Government regulation and under that Government regulation we clearly have one plan here.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.789" offset="3427496">Now, the rule advanced by the respondents as to whether there's one plan or two plans, that some lay fact finder from California, I suppose, years after the fact is going to determine whether the changes to the plan exceeded some unspecified level of significance, is, I would submit, the worst and most destabilizing possible rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.415" offset="3522060">It is not only inherently arbitrary, but it's wildly destabilizing of our pension system.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.550" offset="3542540">It would call into question as a possible anti inurement violation any routine amendment that the employer made either increasing or changing benefits for some group of employees, or adding a new category of participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.859" offset="3599800">It would thus deprive both employers and employees alike of the very security that ERISA is intended to encourage and promote and, of course, it would become doubly destabilizing when combined with petitioner's termination claim, since it could turn out that years after the fact there was an unwitting termination and suddenly people who thought they were accruing benefits find out that they were not accruing benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.925" offset="3696035">Let me just very briefly, as I'm cutting into my rebuttal time, address the termination claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.000" offset="3716411">Respondents have completely abandoned the only termination claim that they brought in their complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.434" offset="3750161">Count IV of their complaint alleged that Hughes was in violation of ERISA's post termination asset distribution provision, section 1344, because Hughes had in fact 1, 1991&gt; ["] terminated the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.077" offset="3816721">The court of appeals reversed the district court's dismissal of that count on the ground that there was a disputed issue of fact as to whether in fact the plan had terminated in 1991.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.145" offset="3864995">In this Court... I think it's very significant, in this Court the Respondents do not even attempt to defend either the holding of the court of appeals, or the count they brought in their complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.623" offset="3914837">They now concede that the only way to have a termination, at least the only means to have a termination, is through the procedures of section 1341 and 1342 of the statute, and they concede that no such termination has occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.783" offset="3971470">They now contend that, quote, the relevant issue for this Court is whether Hughes can be ordered on a going forward basis to use those procedures to terminate the plan, but the respondents never brought any such duty to terminate claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.552" offset="4030611">Nowhere in their complaint is any duty to terminate alleged, and nowhere in their complaint is any cause of action to enforce that duty identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.078" offset="4068646">Rather, the only claim that they brought was a claim for a violation of the asset distribution provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.973" offset="4088290">That requires that there had been a determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.754" offset="4099366">They now concede that there's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.996" offset="4104381">There is nothing more for this Court to do than to affirm the district court's dismissal of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.999" offset="4124339">Thank you, and if I could, I'll save the balance of my time.</text>

            <label>Ms. Lisa Schiavo Blatt</label>
            <text syncTime="1003.314" offset="4157671">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.914" offset="4216081">I would first like to address the contention in this case that Hughes created a new benefit structure that constitutes a different plan under ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.910" offset="4248055">We disagree with that contention for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.652" offset="4259026">First, as reflected in a Department of Treasury regulation, it is the position of all three agencies responsible for enforcing and administering ERISA that a single plan may contain multiple benefit structures as long as all plan assets are available to pay benefits to all plan participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.903" offset="4327989">That principle furthers ERISA's fundamental goal that there is a restricted asset pool that is sufficient and available to satisfy the employer's promise to pay benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.369" offset="4369890">The principle also reflects the employer's general discretion over plan design decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.982" offset="4388280">Second, the factual circumstances test advanced by respondents would be unworkable, because it would call into question any plan amendment that either raises benefits for some but not all of plan participants, or adds a new category of plan participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.263" offset="4449407">I would also like to address the issue of plan termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.395" offset="4461945">As participants in a defined benefit plan, respondents are entitled to receive both their promised and vested benefits, and there is no allegation in this case that Hughes has deprived any employee of those benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.084" offset="4512727">Moreover, Hughes bears the entire investment risk under the plan and must comply with ERISA's minimum funding provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.531" offset="4542507">The security of respondents' benefits is also protected by title IV's insurance program, but unless and until the plan terminates under the exclusive means of title IV, ERISA does not grant participants in a defined benefit plan a right to a distribution of plan assets, and because it's clear in this case that Hughes has not terminated its plan, the plan is ongoing--</text>

            <text syncTime="1121.846" offset="4631741">Well, Ms. Blatt, what do you make of the apparently new claim asserted now that the court should order a termination?</text>

            <text syncTime="1129.531" offset="4662461">--Well, we don't think that there's any basis for implying either the right or the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.754" offset="4679389">There's... it's also our position that even if there was such a basis for reading this common law doctrine into a heavily regulated statute, this is clearly not a common law wasting trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.203" offset="4729230">Under both benefit structures you've got tens of thousands of employees accruing benefits, and that unquestionably furthers the plan's express purpose to provide pension benefits to eligible employees to stimulate their interest in the company and also to attract them, and far from... what termination would do is cease those accruals, and all those employees would be without benefits and future accruals, and that would be not only inconsistent with the purpose of the plan, it would be very bad for the purpose of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.213" offset="4845214">ERISA obviously wants to... one of the important purposes is to encourage the growth and maintenance of these plans, and there are very, very specific provisions in title IV when a plan can be terminated, and the involuntary termination provisions of section 1342 set forth the criteria for the Government to come in and terminate a plan, and the whole point of even the voluntary termination provisions in section 1341 are to make it more difficult for employers to terminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.939" offset="4956182">Either the plan assets have to be sufficient to pay benefits and all the plan liabilities, or they have to demonstrate economic distress criteria, so it's a quite comprehensive provision and even if there was some... and there's certainly nothing in the statute that says... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.501" offset="5022429">There's no violation that's alleged of the statute that respondents would be trying to get a remedy for, but even if assuming they had an alleged violation, there's no remedy, and so we just don't... and even if there was a remedy, this wouldn't meet the criteria of a wasting trust.</text>

Justice Souter, if I could just go back to one of your points on, if there's been a transfer here, I mean, because this is one plan there never was a transfer of assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.143" offset="5212914">The assets just remain available under the plan, and the employer can use them to pay benefits and make amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.318" offset="5237678">In fact, the employer could raise benefits or create an early retirement program like the employer did in Spink and like the employer did here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1297.184" offset="5333077">The restrictions on amendments are similar to what Mr. Cappuccio said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.476" offset="5346243">They can't throw the plan into a significant underfunding, they can't violate the anti inurement provision, and then the key one that's under the regulation is, you have to have a single pool of assets that's available to pay all the benefits, so you can't set up segregated asset pools, but I'm not aware of any amendment that attempted to do that and call it one plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.812" offset="5427640">And that would be just... for all, almost all of the provisions of ERISA, for minimum funding, for reporting, for tax qualification, for fiduciary duty provisions, the Government has got to know what a plan is to have a starting point for what a plan is, and what they look to is whether there's a... what the pool of assets is and what the corresponding liabilities are, and that's the way the statute's been administered, and that's reflected in the Department of Treasury's regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1422.590" offset="5834732">The nub of this case, as Mr. Cappuccio put it, is Hughes' use of the billion dollar surplus in the contributory plan, which was funded in very large part by the contributions of the employee participants, in order to pay Hughes' separate obligations to a new plan as it initially announced that it was establishing for a virtually completely different group of employees without hardly any overlap, paying completely different benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.952" offset="5964195">Mr. Cappuccio in his remarks this morning again referred to it as two plans, Hughes' announcement referred to it as two plans, and announced that a new noncontributory plan would be funded entirely by Hughes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.863" offset="6031800">There was nothing wrong with creating a new noncontributory plan for new employees and nonparticipants in the old contributory plan, but that was a separate plan, as Hughes itself said, to be funded by Hughes, and not to be funded out of contributory plan assets.</text>

            <text syncTime="1525.267" offset="6245482">Indeed, it says specifically that it does not apply unless more than a single plan is involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="3259.952" offset="13184231">That's right, and of course nothing would... 6.5(b) doesn't say we won't make any amendments that affect who's a participant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.748" offset="13211398">In fact, anything we do, since the eligibility requirements are incorporated, would affect who's a participant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.710" offset="13231251">That's... the sort of ultimate irony on the 6.5(b) claim would be that if it prevailed we couldn't pay the respondents' benefits, because section 2.4 of the plan excludes retired employees from the definition of participant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.169" offset="13285064">It would just be absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.050" offset="13288616">If there are no further questions, I'll submit.</text>
