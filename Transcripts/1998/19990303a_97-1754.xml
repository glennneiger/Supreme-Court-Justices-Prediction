            <text syncTime="21.908" offset="237658">In the Immigration and Nationality Act, Congress expressly invested in the Attorney General the authority to determine whether an alien who has committed a serious, nonpolitical crime should be denied withholding of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.879" offset="297531">Congress further made clear that once the Attorney General has serious reasons for considering that such a crime occurred, the bar on withholding is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.565" offset="336297">The issue in this case is whether the Attorney General, through the Board of Immigration Appeals, had serious reasons for considering that respondent's acts of burning buses, destroying private stores, and hitting, binding, and stoning innocent civilians constituted serious nonpolitical crimes.</text>
