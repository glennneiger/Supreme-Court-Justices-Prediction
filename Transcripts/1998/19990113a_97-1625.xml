            <text syncTime="55.609" offset="365052">There are two issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.040" offset="374770">The first is the question of whether or not the FTC Act has jurisdiction over a nonprofit professional association, and the second issue is whether or not the Commission and the Ninth Circuit appropriately applied a quick look rule of reason analysis to the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.430" offset="444360">The jurisdictional dispute in this case is over the interpretation of... of the phrase in section 4 of the FTC Act, which reads in its relevant part... and this may be found in the petitioner's brief at pages 1 and 2... a company, trust, or association without shares of capital or capital stock which is organized to carry on business for its own profit or that of its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.398" offset="544252">There is no disagreement on the record before Your Honors that the CDA is a bona fide, not-for-profit organized under California law, with a 501(c)(6) Federal tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.057" offset="594825">There are two major cases that discuss this jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.471" offset="612484">The first is the Community Blood Bank case and the second is the AMA case.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.647" offset="633278">In the Blood Bank case, both of the respondents were not-for-profit associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.970" offset="662535">After a full trial, the FTC and the hearing officer found that they had violated the antitrust laws by hindering the development of two commercial blood banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.657" offset="705271">On the jurisdictional issue, the hearing officer who heard the case and the commission made specific findings that there were benefits to members in these cases, and that's how they rested their jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="212.330" offset="991991">But in connection with the California Dental Association, its primary purpose is for the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.405" offset="1020308">It's to promote the art and science of dentistry.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.049" offset="1034832">I think the critical language in the statute requires, however, that there be a profit, and profit was defined in the Community Blood Bank case to be the excess of revenue over expenses, with a contemplation that it is to be paid to the members.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.018" offset="1094705">That was not done in the California Dental Association, and that's clear in this record.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.955" offset="1370453">But, Your Honor, as far as the California Dental Association is concerned, nonmembers can get those same services by paying a little more in the way of a fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.681" offset="1405353">There's nothing that the California Dental Association does for dentists in the State of California that dentists can't get elsewhere, and in fact, only 75 percent of the dentists in the State are members of the California Dental Association.</text>

            <text syncTime="356.838" offset="1570029">There was 7 percent for public service, and then there was 65 percent for membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.133" offset="1591136">But that membership includes the promotion of the art and science of dentistry and high professional standards, so it's not mutually exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.449" offset="1628438">In other words, in that 65 percent, there is the promotion of the public interest.</text>
