            <text syncTime="14.058" offset="209234">Because this matter was decided by the lower court on a motion to dismiss, for purposes of today's argument, United cannot dispute the nature of the discrimination that occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.329" offset="246327">Petitioners have gone to great lengths to make themselves eminently qualified to fill the piloting positions at issue here, but were excluded from those positions by United based not upon their actual abilities, but based only upon its preconceived notion of what a person who shares their impairment can and cannot do.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.891" offset="316545">Now, United contends that even if it discriminated in just this manner, it cannot be liable under the Americans with Disabilities Act because, as a matter of law, the ADA can never protect one with severe but correctable myopia.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.718" offset="367849">United's intuition that myopia is somehow distinct from other correctable impairments does not withstand serious scrutiny.</text>
