            <text syncTime="13.762" offset="201190">Respondent, Sun-Diamond Growers, was extensively regulated by the United States Department of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.086" offset="226476">In the first 14 months of Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy's tenure, Sun-Diamond lavished on its chief regulator thousands of dollars in gifts, while it had millions of dollars at stake in USDA programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.927" offset="289901">The jury convicted Respondent of giving unlawful gratuities under Section 201(c) by finding that Sun-Diamond gave the gratuities for or because of the Secretary's official position.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.673" offset="340892">Under the plain language of the statute, an official act... Section 201(a)(3)... means any decision or action on any matter which may be pending before the public official in his official capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.202" offset="398989">Here, the statute reaches $6,000 in gifts given by a regulated entity for or because of the official's position, his capacity to act, on matters pending or on matters which could be brought before USDA.</text>

            <text syncTime="130.219" offset="667005">The issue, however, is whether or not the district judge's explanation of what would be sufficient proof of the requisite motivation was satisfied by a jury finding that the motivation behind the gift was for or because of the official's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.899" offset="725728">In this case, involving a regulated entity, our position is that the position of the official is coextensive with his capacity to act on any number of acts coming before him.</text>

            <text syncTime="197.666" offset="936798">And at that point, even assuming there's some... there's some merit to your argument, it seems to me, at that point, the judge just totally untethered the... the... if you will, the position from the... from the capacity to act or the anticipation of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.465" offset="1008060">And... and even if we were to accept your position, we... wouldn't we have to find error in... in that instruction?</text>

            <text syncTime="241.385" offset="1111714">I mean, the bribery... the bribery offense, as... as we've described it, requires a... a fairly specific quid pro quo kind of link, specific act, specific gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.964" offset="1154032">This went far beyond anything that would be appropriate to distinguish this from the bribery statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="264.181" offset="1202933">That is, that the jury did not have to find that there was a particular official act or a matter in mind at the time of the gift.</text>

            <text syncTime="293.754" offset="1321216">That is to say, why should we read a criminal statute to suddenly make a group of old-age home residents decide to... to send a little present because they think the Senator has been generally in favor of old-age homes?</text>
            <text syncTime="309.235" offset="1383074">Or... I mean, why should you have such an expansive reading of a criminal statute when there are a large number of ethics rules and other noncriminal matters that adequately, at least arguably, control conduct like this when it is unethical?</text>
            <text syncTime="326.576" offset="1452455">Why should we give prosecutors such broad discretion to prosecute people who may have done things that are not even immoral?</text>

            <text syncTime="341.529" offset="1512328">The "why" question is that it shouldn't be any less offensive to integrity in government that gratuities were given with a particular matter in mind, a whole multitude of matters in mind, or no specific or any official act in mind at the time of the gift, as long as there is sufficient proof of motivation of the prospect of official action; in other words, the prospect of official conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.235" offset="1615146">To answer your hypothetical, in that hypothetical circumstance, it is our position that our logic... the logic to the "for or because of" official position argument would be sufficient to encompass your hypothetical if the motivation behind that gift was the senior citizen offering a gift to a public official, in... in that circumstance, because of the official's position or, indeed, because of official action... action with respect to legislation that was of interest to that senior citizen.</text>

            <text syncTime="416.907" offset="1813781">And the reason I don't find it amazing is that they already have, but in a different section of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.941" offset="1837918">And the problem is that we normally interpret a statute in such fashion as not to duplicate something else that is already on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.910" offset="1873862">How does this statute, as you interpret it, differ from 5 U.S.C., Section 7353, which prohibits Federal employees from accepting anything of value from persons, quote, whose interests may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the individual's official duties?</text>

            <text syncTime="3296.301" offset="13331377">What I was going to go back to is the issue of these two classes, and the fact that because Sun-Diamond is a regulated entity, somehow we deserve a different standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.190" offset="13382891">I think, effectively, what that does is create an impermissible irrebuttable presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.764" offset="13401281">That is, if the jury were to find... and if the jury did find... that Sun-Diamond gave gifts for or because of any official position, then the court, as a matter of law, was saying, then Sun-Diamond must have given it for or because of any official act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.235" offset="13463139">And under In re Winship, of course, it is the government's burden to prove each and every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.099" offset="13494590">I wanted to go back, also to the issue of this hierarchy of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.314" offset="13519459">Clearly, at the top of the hierarchy is bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.097" offset="13534610">Clearly, below that we have the gratuity as a reward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.388" offset="13551746">In our view, at the bottom is for or because of an official position, which is governed, we believe, administratively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.673" offset="13584870">There is a question as to whether or not there is a gap between bribery and the gratuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.168" offset="13610888">Does bribery... clearly, bribery covers improper attempts to influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.071" offset="13626457">Clearly, gratuity covers the issue of rewards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.143" offset="13638786">The difficult issue is whether or not there is a gap that is filled by the gratuity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.188" offset="13666894">And that's why I'm partial to the language of the Court of Appeals that says, essentially, we don't have to decide what the bribery statute line is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.852" offset="13697614">But wherever we draw that line, the gap will be filled by the gratuity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.396" offset="13719766">To conclude, we believe that the district court, by instructing the jury that the government did not have to prove that Sun-Diamond gave gifts for any act at all stripped the jury of its fact-finding mission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.382" offset="13815688">It simply did not have an opportunity to decide the one question that was crucial to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.826" offset="13841497">That question was purposefully kept away from the jury because the government argued, and the district court agreed, that no connection needed to be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.521" offset="13880262">That relieved the government of its constitutional obligation to prove every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.407" offset="13907848">That was error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.939" offset="13913908">And for that reason, we therefore ask for this Court to affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
