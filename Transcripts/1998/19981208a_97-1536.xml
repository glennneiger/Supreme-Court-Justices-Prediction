            <text syncTime="78.883" offset="446852">This Court should adopt a categorical bright line rule that nontribal members who work as Federal contractors on Indian reservations are subject to nondiscriminatory State taxes unless Congress expressly provides otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.760" offset="498365">This rule will clarify existing law, recognize a uniform rule that applies throughout the country, and provide certainty and predictability to contractors, the Federal Government, and to States.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.401" offset="544968">This rule is consistent with this Court's precedents regarding Federal contractors and will not require the Court to rule... overrule any of its decisions concerning taxation of persons doing business with Indian tribes or tribal members.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.958" offset="595227">This is the rule that the United States itself argues here should apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="122.612" offset="621768">There's something, legislation, called the Self-Determination Act under which, if I understand it correctly, an Indian tribe could opt to accept Federal money to build roads and projects like this using that money but itself administering the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.478" offset="717271">Now, if the tribe had done so and had awarded the contract in question here, could... could the State have been able to impose the tax then, do you think?</text>

            <text syncTime="157.702" offset="762202">Under the authority of the Ramah Navajo School Board case, if a contractor... a nontribal member contractor deals directly with a tribal entity, then there is no State tax.</text>

            <label>Mr. Patrick Irvine</label>
            <text syncTime="202.596" offset="941715">The assessment, including interest, was approximately 1.2 million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.297" offset="960524">The tax, as a percentage of the gross receipts for every contract, is 3.5 percent of the gross receipts.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="214.487" offset="989258">And yet, in fact, the State has provided very little in the nature of services, I guess, in connection with this contractor.</text>

            <label>Mr. Patrick Irvine</label>
            <text syncTime="223.343" offset="1024680">We don't argue that there are any direct services directly to these contracts or the particular geographic location.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.413" offset="1049026">As we cite in the brief, the State has not ignored these reservations and does provide numerous general services to the reservations and, indeed, to Blaze both on and off the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.869" offset="1090822">We have not argued that there have to be direct services.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.555" offset="1101585">And that's consistent with the rule that applies to any Federal contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.458" offset="1117154">Almost any Federal contract, whether it be on a military base or in a national forest, may involve little in the way of State services, and the State may have very little authority to regulate the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.897" offset="1158950">But Congress--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="258.682" offset="1166055">Well, but I thought that we had made a special inquiry into the extent the State has provided services when Indian sovereignty is at stake, as opposed to whether or not the State can just tax a Federal contractor without added complication of an Indian reservation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Patrick Irvine</label>
            <text syncTime="284.232" offset="1268246">That's correct, Your Honor, but this issue of Federal contractors has never been addressed by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.718" offset="1290189">The existence of the Federal Government as a party to the contract really changes the nature of the analysis because the Federal sovereign is such an overwhelming presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.307" offset="1324566">The Federal Government does not need the courts to protect it from States.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.926" offset="1339090">It hasn't hesitated to... to sue States when it felt that the taxes were not... not supported by the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.215" offset="1368243">The categorical test that we argue for would apply just to Federal contractors as it does with any Federal contractor throughout the country.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="318.221" offset="1404187">And... and you would say the Cotton Petroleum inquiry then is... is not necessary when there's a Federal contractor involved?</text>

            <label>Mr. Patrick Irvine</label>
            <text syncTime="324.392" offset="1428951">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.741" offset="1434280">And if it... if a contract still involved a contract with someone other than the Federal Government, the Court's analysis, the balancing test, the particularized inquiry would still be effective, though as we argue in our brief, the lower court misapplied that analysis as well just because it didn't take into account that tribal sovereignty, tribal interests are not really affected in any significant way when it's a contract between a nontribal member and a nonmember such as the United States itself.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="353.978" stopTime="373.807">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="353.978" offset="1547234">What about the argument that it will reduce the total amount available for road building if some money has to be spent in paying State taxes, that that money that could be spared would otherwise be available to build more roads inside the reservation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="patrick_irvine" startTime="373.807" stopTime="449.788">
            <label>Mr. Patrick Irvine</label>
            <text syncTime="373.807" offset="1626541">Your Honor, I think the... this Court has consistently held, both in the context of Federal contractors and even contracts on reservations, that the very fact that there may be economic effects are not sufficient to preempt the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.449" offset="1673144">In the case involving a Federal contractor, that's even more applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.567" offset="1689653">As this Court held in the United States v. New Mexico, even if the cost is directly passed on to the Federal Government, that's not ground for preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.273" offset="1724448">In U.S. v. New Mexico, I believe it was a cost-plus contract, so there was no doubt that the cost was passed on to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.161" offset="1752034">Economic effects themselves are not sufficient to... to preempt the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.080" offset="1775648">As the United States points out in its brief, merely because there's a tax on the Federal contractor does not necessarily mean that there will be an impact on the... the number... the amount of roads built or the amount of work done because it will hinge on what the agency does, what Congress does in their appropriations.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.209" offset="1840223">There's no evidence that Congress hasn't appropriated funds taking into account the full amount of the taxes and equally could reduce the appropriation if there's a less... 5 percent less because of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.581" offset="1881706">So, the economic effects are a difficult standard to apply and this Court has generally rejected it in the Federal... Federal contractor context, as well as tribal... reservation transactions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="449.788" stopTime="455.573">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="449.788" offset="1930502">Are these contracts subject to Federal wage laws?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="patrick_irvine" startTime="455.573" stopTime="458.977">
            <label>Mr. Patrick Irvine</label>
            <text syncTime="455.573" offset="1953595">I believe they would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.775" offset="1958401">They are direct contracts with the Federal Government.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="458.977" offset="1967283">So, there may be no economic impact at all if indeed the wages are... happen to be set according to what the rest of the industry is doing in that area no matter... and the rest of the... and the rest of the industry is paying taxes if the market is operating properly anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.819" offset="2034574">This contract wouldn't necessarily be reduced by the amount of the tax.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="patrick_irvine" startTime="480.807" stopTime="725.781">
            <label>Mr. Patrick Irvine</label>
            <text syncTime="480.807" offset="2054532">That's correct, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.425" offset="2061010">And, indeed, by looking at economic effects, that's always a difficult test to apply because it's very unpredictable.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.413" offset="2085043">This is a tax which means that both the contractors and the Federal Government benefit by having certainty and predictability knowing when the contract is issued whether it's subject to tax, which is why we focus on who the contracting parties are as opposed to a more amorphous standard, which may very well apply in the context when tribal interests are affected but where the Federal sovereign is a party to the contract and can certainly protect itself from overreaching State taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.730" offset="2190264">Those considerations just aren't an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.395" offset="2200922">There really is no reason to apply a different rule than the categorical bright line test for reservation transactions because the cases this Court has... has decided involving reservation transactions that apply a different test have all involved effects on tribes and tribal members, contracts with tribes or tribal members, costs that are directly passed on to tribal treasuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.096" offset="2291724">The Court has repeatedly drawn the line, saying that protecting tribal sovereignty, tribal interest is really what the key is in... in applying a different test.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.385" offset="2328922">Indian sovereignty, as the Court has described, provides the backdrop against which the applicable treaties must be read.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.188" offset="2352119">Here tribal sovereignty is not endangered by a tax on a Federal contractor because if there is any danger, it's to the Federal Government which, as I've stated, can protect itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.913" offset="2390989">Merely because the cost is passed on to the Federal Government or even to a tribe is not sufficient in and of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.567" offset="2417634">There must be essentially the State reaching into the reservation and trying to regulate a transaction with a tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.471" offset="2445219">Applying State laws to tribal members on the reservation is what this Court has consistently sought to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.791" offset="2474476">It has not sought to protect nonmembers or the Federal Government from the reach of State laws anywhere within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.212" offset="2504151">The Court has, over the past 150 years or so, tried to develop different analysis, the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine that the Court discussed in detail in Cotton Petroleum, but the Court has come around to the idea that that is just too difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.371" offset="2560785">The standard should be is the legal incidence of the tax on the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.858" offset="2578757">If it is not, the tax should be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.977" offset="2587221">If you try to look through the transaction, you do end up with a fairly free-wheeling balancing test which is difficult to apply certainly in advance, sometimes even at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.749" offset="2626300">Even if the Court doesn't apply a categorical test, as we've argued under the implied preemption analysis, the lower court erred because it didn't give sufficient weight to the State's interest in regulating activities throughout the State, including on reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.425" offset="2693069">In this case, State law does not... is not imposed on any transaction involving a tribal member or a tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.614" offset="2721804">There's no impact on tribal sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.066" offset="2731626">Cotton Petroleum certainly held that State taxes are permissible if they do not directly and substantially affect tribal interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.820" offset="2758584">Other cases of this Court hold the same, particularly the tobacco cases... excuse me... where the Court has consistently found that the State has an interest in taxing sales to nonmembers of cigarette products and other products even though it has economic impact on the tribe, even though the tribe, indeed, is the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.282" offset="2832458">So, in those cases, the tribe or the tribal member is actually a party to the transaction, but the Court has said that the State has an interest in taxing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.371" offset="2860879">The State has not looked at any specific services that are required in those tobacco cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.525" offset="2885435">It sort of accepted the fact that nonmembers receive services.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.727" offset="2898287">It hasn't required a direct connection with those... with the taxed activities, and consistently applying those precedents leads to the line again that the Court will seek to protect taxes that directly impact on tribes but will not seek to protect nonmembers merely because they do business on reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.105" offset="2967773">These transactions do take place within the State of Arizona, and that's the key element here.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.009" offset="2991387">And just because they're on a reservation does not mean different rules should apply if tribal sovereignty is not implicated, and the Court has required that that really be the test.</text>

            <text syncTime="741.493" offset="3097340">That's a very indirect impact, Your Honor, and I think if... every tax will have an effect on decision making.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.230" offset="3124298">The absence of a tax will have an effect on decision making.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.349" offset="3136733">And if the change... the effect on decision making is the test, it becomes almost impossible to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.436" offset="3161079">In this case, the decisions are made by the Federal Government which has accepted tribal input, but ultimately the burden of the tax rests on the contractor which does business with the Federal Government which, under its own sovereign powers, has the right to make the decisions that it chooses to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.196" offset="3224086">And so, there really is no direct or substantial effect on tribal decision making because the State is taxing parties that the tribe does not... or that the contractor does not even do... do business with.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.371" offset="3280824">And the Federal Government in this case, because of its own sovereignty, is not... is the major party here.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.192" offset="3312066">To the... even under the implied preemption analysis, if there is a passing on of the tax to anyone, it's to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.113" offset="3335786">It's not the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.231" offset="3340279">This Court's decisions upholding the tax... the taxes on nonmembers would really govern here, and as I mentioned, the lower court just gave too little weight to the very fact that the State does have sovereign interests throughout the State, including on Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.475" offset="3401196">The only limitation is when there is an impact on tribal sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.509" offset="3417392">In this case, the contract takes place on a reservation, but the direct impact of the tax is on that contract between Blaze and the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.215" offset="3452187">Any effects on tribal sovereignty are very indirect, and therefore, even under the implied preemption analysis, there should be no... there should be no preemption here.</text>

            <label>Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann</label>
            <text syncTime="846.244" offset="3516344">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="856.016" offset="3555423">We believe that under United States v. New Mexico, respondent Blaze as the Federal contractor is subject to the nondiscriminatory State tax at issue here because Congress has not expressly acted to provide otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.959" offset="3611221">The fact that the contracts involved building and maintenance of roads on Indian reservations should not alter that analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.279" offset="3640478">The Blaze company's invocation of the Indian preemption doctrine is misplaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.017" offset="3663361">That doctrine has been applied by this Court in cases where nontribal members engage in direct commercial dealings with Indian tribes or members of tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.773" offset="3702440">But here, the nontribal members engaged in direct dealings with a Federal agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.610" offset="3721771">Thus, the three primary concerns that trigger application of the Indian preemption doctrine are not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.513" offset="3749356">First, State taxes on Federal contractors will not unduly interfere with tribal sovereignty because the United States is the contracting party, not the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.321" offset="3792615">The tribe's involvement in the making and performance of the contract is far less significant than if the tribe was a party to the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.160" offset="3823962">Second, State taxes on Federal contractors have only an uncertain and indirect effect on a tribe's economic self-sufficiency because that effect depends on the United States' response to the State tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.218" offset="3880177">The tribal treasury is not directly involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.837" offset="3890731">The United States may choose not to pass the State tax on to the tribal entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.590" offset="3913719">The United States may increase appropriations, or the United States may change the allocation of the funds.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="953.179" offset="3944021">Ms. Brinkmann, what if the tribe had elected under the Self-Determination Act to take the money and... and award the contracts?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="beth_s_brinkmann" startTime="961.619" stopTime="1113.000">
            <label>Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann</label>
            <text syncTime="961.619" offset="3977771">We believe that the Indian preemption doctrine then would be applied, and there would be a balancing analysis under that because in that situation, Your Honor, these concerns about direct relations with the tribe, tribal sovereignty, and economic self-sufficiency of the tribe would be at issue because the tribe would be a party to the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.997" offset="4055302">With regard to the third major reason we think that the State taxes on Federal contracts don't call for the application of that doctrine, though, is because the core concerns about the regulation of direct relations with Indians is not present because the tribe is not a... a member to the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.910" offset="4130953">Those kinds of Federal concerns are found in the Indian Commerce Clause, the Federal Government's ability to regulate commerce directly with Indian tribes, and in statutes such as the Indian trader statutes and the Self-Determination Act statute, which Justice O'Connor asked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.854" offset="4198767">The interests underlying those statutes would come into play if the Indian tribe were a direct party to the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.525" offset="4229487">Also, regarding the economic self-sufficiency, as United States v. New Mexico makes clear, in a case where the United States is the contracting party, the United States has the authority to alter the imposition of that State tax by legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.969" offset="4291240">Here, of course, the tribe would not have that authority if they were the direct party to the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.205" offset="4312138">And as the Court made clear in the Montana v. Crow case and the Cotton Petroleum case, the Indian preemption doctrine in those situations protects against extraordinarily high taxes, protects the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.331" offset="4360621">Respondent, nonetheless, invokes the Indian preemption doctrine based on purported interference with Federal interests, particularly the Self-Determination Act, which we were just discussing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.888" offset="4402940">As we discussed, that statute authorizes tribes to make the choice whether to take over Federal Government projects, enter into their own relationships with contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.827" offset="4438675">But in response to your question, Justice Ginsburg, to my co-counsel, we believe there's nothing in that statute that suggests that it was intended to preempt all aspects of a State law that could somehow indirectly affect a tribe's decision whether to enter into a Self-Determination Act contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.039" offset="4511505">Rather, that statute reinforces the fact that there is a distinction between a contract with the Federal Government and a contract with a tribe, reinforcing the fact that when there's a tribal contract and the contract is directly with the tribe, questions of tribal sovereignty and self-determination are at issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1256.359" offset="5156729">In 1980, the State of Arizona came to this Court and admitted that it wanted to tax a nonmember use of BIA roads, and this Court in White Mountain v. Bracker told the State of Arizona, you cannot tax when a nonmember uses those same BIA roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.105" offset="5235724">Now the State is here to say when a nonmember is building those same BIA roads, we are entitled to tax it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.228" offset="5268220">Under the implied preemption analysis for Indian cases, this Court should affirm the decision of the Arizona Court of Appeals and hold that this tax is preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.138" offset="5323913">The central issue in this case is, I believe, what test should this Court apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.058" offset="5355573">Should it apply the United States v. New Mexico rule, or should it apply Indian preemption analysis?</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.314" offset="5384621">There are several reasons why United States v. New Mexico simply does not work here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.967" offset="5411162">United States v. New Mexico is a decision of this Court based on the clash of only two sovereigns, that is, State authority and Federal authority, and whether States can tax contractors with the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.227" offset="5472288">That two-sovereign dispute is not at issue when you are dealing with Indian tribes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2216.585" offset="8997670">And the Court, probably for the first time, has before it an actual record of the... of the impact of this tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="2405.903" offset="9754907">You simply look at the State involvement with the on-reservation activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.057" offset="9775596">You look at the Federal and tribal interests that are involved and you do the balancing test and you make the decision as to where it comes out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.144" offset="9803913">Now, in some of the cases that have been cited in the briefs like the Gila River case, you had a situation in which the State or State agencies were actively involved in the on... on-reservation activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.202" offset="9856158">Policemen were provided for certain events.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.337" offset="9868697">In that case, the Court was able to determine this is how the balancing test comes out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.473" offset="9889281">Going back to the contracting situation, you would look at situations involving perhaps under the Indian Health Service a clinic or a medical facility and the other applicable Federal statutes to determine what kind of... of balancing and how that test comes out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.506" offset="9981337">The petitioners and the United States have argued that, you know, we... we don't have to necessarily consider each and every factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.147" offset="10031910">And this is just one factor and it's almost like a slippery slope here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.016" offset="10051449">But what is important to consider is this Court's decisions in the New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache Tribe and in the White Mountain/Bracker case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.740" offset="10094290">In both of those decisions, this Court said, we need to consider whether this tax would affect the full objectives of the Federal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.881" offset="10138907">Similarly in the New Mexico/Mescalero Apache case, the Court said, how is this going to affect the legislation?</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.456" offset="10185196">And that's what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.839" offset="10190734">We have a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.641" offset="10193869">It's a set percentage of a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.858" offset="10202750">And the Court has to ask itself, is this going to interfere with Congress' stated objective, interfering with decisions on whether or not to enter into these Self-Determination Act decisions?</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.900" offset="10254995">It clearly will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.133" offset="10259906">Like in Bracker where the Court condemned the imposition of the tax, even though it was only 5,000 or 6,000 dollars in annual taxes, this Court said that that tax will add an additional factor for the parties to consider, and that is sufficient for us to find that the tax is preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.896" offset="10350917">This road construction contract is no different than the construction contract at issue in the White Mountain/Bracker case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.568" offset="10389578">We believe that that case is on all fours with this case but for the issue of whether or not the Court should apply preemption analysis to Indian roads.</text>

            <text syncTime="2659.330" offset="10768667">I met Mr. Ward at the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.099" offset="10775773">I think I've met a lot of Mr. Wards in different capacities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.801" offset="10790506">And I think officials at that level want a clear rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.454" offset="10813180">Mr. Ward, I'm sure, wants to be able to tell the people, the contractors, whether it's taxable or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.406" offset="10832928">If the test is we don't know because it depends on whether the State provides services, we don't know because it depends on which statute authorizes the funding and what may apply, that's no help to Mr. Ward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.381" offset="10876919">It's no help to Blaze Construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.666" offset="10882039">It's no help to the State of Arizona in deciding whether the tax is permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.201" offset="10900115">So, in terms of... of the interest of... of lower levels of the BIA, I would think a... a clear bright line rule, as the United States itself argues here, should be the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.343" offset="10940762">In terms of multiple sovereignties, here there is a clash between only two sovereigns, the State and the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.097" offset="10967720">The tribe is not a party to the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.281" offset="10976497">The transactions take place on the reservation, but the tribe is... is not affected except indirectly through the Federal sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.602" offset="11001784">The agency certainly is the Bureau of Indian Affairs which does have trust responsibilities to the tribes, but that's a function which is... is between the tribes and the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.791" offset="11042535">It's not something that the State is involved in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.743" offset="11050267">There's nothing in the record that shows that Congress expects the State of Arizona to help the BIA pay its bills by not imposing its taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.980" offset="11083286">And certainly there can be interference with tribal decision making because of a State tax, but if there is no tax on Federal contractors, there can equally be interference with Bureau of Indian Affairs decision making.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.871" offset="11126858">Would the Bureau then have to decide whether to construct projects on the reservation or off the reservation because there might be some tax effect?</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.874" offset="11154861">The Indian Health Service has a hospital in Phoenix, good transportation, good other health care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.428" offset="11177013">If there's a tax savings, should they be enticed to move 20 or 30 miles to a reservation just because of the tax effects?</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.618" offset="11205853">As I mentioned earlier, there's always an effect of... on... there's always an effect on decision making whether there is or isn't a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.188" offset="11232079">Finally, as far as the Self-Determination Act goes, that doesn't even apply to the contracts at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.676" offset="11254022">These contracts were not between the tribe and the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.228" offset="11272308">Each of the tribes chose not to exercise their option under the Self-Determination Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.698" offset="11290176">This Court has never preempted a tax on a reservation based on a statutory scheme that doesn't even apply to the regulated activity, and I suggest it shouldn't here either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.637" offset="11329882">If there are no further questions, I'll conclude with that.</text>
