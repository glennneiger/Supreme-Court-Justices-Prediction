            <text syncTime="66.692" offset="395849">Under the Constitution's venue provisions, a criminal trial shall be held in the State where the crime shall have been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.696" offset="423853">The issue in this case is how that principle is to be applied in a case where the offense has more than one actus reus element and where one of those actus reus elements was carried out over several States.</text>

            <text syncTime="87.539" offset="479232">The English... it can be the... it can be interpreted as the act of the crime, or the act of the thing, and it does not have a universal meaning, but generally speaking the courts have looked at... have isolated actus reus as the conduct that must be performed by the defendant to make him punishable for a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.185" offset="557809">It is generally distinguishable from two other aspects of the crime, the mens rea, or the mental state, and other circumstances surrounding the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.125" offset="589574">This is generally the approach that is taken by the Model Penal Code, which does not use the term, actus reus, but which uses the term... but which distinguishes among conduct, mental state, and attendant circumstances, and that sort of... that provision of the various aspects of the crime is also reflected in Justice Holmes' discussion of the common law.</text>

            <text syncTime="204.616" offset="947451">In this case, that means that respondent was properly prosecuted in New Jersey, because one of the elements of the offense, defined by section 924(c), was the kidnapping, which in this case was a continuing, unitary, undivided crime that began in Texas, was continued into New Jersey, which was for some period of time the defendant's base of operations, and then was continued into Maryland.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.160" offset="1225707">It is equally an element of the offense as the use of... as the use or carrying of the firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.247" offset="1245978">In its application, this statute essentially is no different from a statute that might define a crime of aggravated kidnapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.603" offset="1283490">I mean, suppose, for example... kidnapping is defined in section 1201(a) of the United States Code, of title 18, as whoever kidnaps and holds for ransom any person shall be punishable by a term of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.597" offset="1335422">What 924(c)... it's as if there were an added sentence to that section and says, and whoever, during and in relation to that kidnapping, uses or carries a gun, shall also be punished by an additional 5 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.587" offset="1391428">I think it would be odd in that situation if someone were prosecuted for aggravated kidnapping to say that the only place he could be prosecuted would be where the aggravation took place, and not over the entirety of... and not anywhere where the entirety of the kidnapping takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.164" offset="1449734">Now, what Congress has done in 924(c) is, it has essentially created sort of an off-the-shelf aggravation element which can be applied to a variety of crimes of violence or drug-trafficking crimes.</text>
