            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="85556">The opinion of the Court in No. 97-2044, United States versus Haggar Apparel Company, will be announced by Justice Kennedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="9.047" offset="121709">This case arises from a refund proceedings for duties imposed on men's garments that were shipped by the respondent to this country from an assembly plant that it controlled in Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.579" offset="171865">What happens is that, this manufacturer was attempting to use Mexican plants for assembly purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.351" offset="214914">It shipped pre-cut fabrics to the plant in Mexico with threads, buttons, and zippers and they were assembled there.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.516" offset="255561">If that had been all, they would have been entitled to a duty exemption without question.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.029" offset="277608">But the fabric had been pretreated with a chemical and when the chemical is subjected to heat, it then puts the permapress in the garments and the baking and the heating was also done in Mexico and the question is whether or not this is incidental to assembly or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="66.343" offset="350856">The respondent sought to permapress the garments in order to maintain their creases, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.031" offset="369664">To accomplish this, they baked the chemically pretreated garments at the Mexican plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.169" offset="386173">The statute on which the respondent relies does provide a partial exemption from duties, otherwise imposed if the articles assembled abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.513" offset="419505">I have not been improved in condition except by being assembled or by being subjected to operations incidental to the assembly process.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.076" offset="449807">The custom service claimed that the baking was an added process in addition to assembly and it denied the duty exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.890" offset="477079">Respondent's cases made more difficult by a regulation adopted by the Commissioner of Customs that deems all permapress in operations not incidental to the assembly process.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.615" offset="515949">The respondent brought suit for refund in the Court of International Trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.225" offset="530369">The Court declined to treat the regulation as controlling and it ruled in favor of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.726" offset="548446">The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed; it also declined to give the regulations deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.480" offset="571434">Contrary to the position of that Court and the Court of Appeals, we hold the regulation in question is subject to the analysis required by Chevron, USA and that if it is a reasonable regulation and implementation of an ambiguous statutory provision, it must be given judicial deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.636" offset="644054">The statutory scheme does not support the respondent's contention that the regulation is limited in application to customs officers themselves and is not intended to govern the adjudications of importers' refund suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.997" offset="689507">In addition, nothing in the regulation in question persuade us that the agency intended the regulation to have some lesser force and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.212" offset="718346">We also reject the argument that various statutes empower the Court of International Trade to interpret the tariff statute without giving Chevron deference to the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.802" offset="756694">We declined to reach the question whether the regulation in question does need the preconditions for Chevron deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.287" offset="778637">Respondent's various arguments in this respect are best addressed in the first instance to the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.881" offset="797027">Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justice Ginsburg joins.</text>
