            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="85796">The opinion of the Court in No. 98-387, Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Association Inc. vresus United States will be announced by Justice Stevens.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="10.284" stopTime="358.200">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="10.284" offset="126860">Now this case comes to us to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.065" offset="145982">A Federal statute enacted in 1934 that is now codified as Section 1304 of the Criminal Code, as well as a Federal Communications Commission regulation, prohibit radio and television broadcasters from carrying certain advertisements about gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.881" offset="217244">For example, the ban applies to advertising for state-run lotteries if broadcast from a state without a lottery.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.294" offset="242949">As well as to advertising for commercial gambling, commercial casino gambling but regardless of the stations or the casinos vocation unless the casino is operated by an Indian Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.331" offset="291118">Petitioners who represent New Orleans Broadcasters wish to run advertisements for private commercial casinos that are lawful and regulated in Louisiana and Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.761" offset="336780">They filed this suit alleging the Section 1304 and the Commission Regulation violate the First Amendment as applied to them, the District Court however granted the Government’s cross-motion for summary judgment and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.420" offset="395399">We accepted the broadcaster’s petition for certiorari and now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.955" offset="413580">We hold that the First Amendment protects petitioners right to broadcast advertisements of lawful private casino gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.080" offset="450047">Our decision in a case known as Central Hudson set out a four-part test for evaluating governmental restrictions and commercial speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.278" offset="482857">That test asks first whether the speech at issue concerns lawful activity and is not misleading, and second whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.453" offset="523608">If so we must then consider whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted and finally whether the regulation is not more extensive than is necessary to serve the government's articulated interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.596" offset="576167">Although we have been asked to reject that four-part standard in a favor of the more straightforward and stringent rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.656" offset="600408">We do not have to break new ground in this case because the State’s speech restriction before us cannot survive the Central Hudson analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.923" offset="637398">All agreed that petitioners proposed broadcasts constitute commercial speech and that their content would not mislead in what concern lawful activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.370" offset="675223">We can also accept the two interests asserted by the government as substantial: First, reducing a social cost associated with casino and other forms of gambling; and second assisting States that restrict or prohibit casino and other forms of gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.337" offset="739066">We cannot however ignore the Congress’ unwillingness to adopt a single national policy that consistently endorses either interest asserted by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.023" offset="777832">When Section 1304 was enacted in 1934 it was part of a uniform federal antigambling policy that is no longer the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.652" offset="816389">With partial or complete exemptions for advertising about tribal and state-run casinos, parimutuel horse and dog racing, state and local lotteries, fishing contest and high life.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.931" offset="865499">The government's gambling policy is decidedly equivocal at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.923" offset="885456">In the judgment of Congress and many state legislatures the social cost supporting the suppression of gambling are often outset and sometimes outweighed by countervailing policy considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.156" offset="934358">Bearing in mind this ambivalence, the government cannot satisfy the third and fourth parts of the Central Hudson test.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.107" offset="962152">With regard of the Government’s first asserted interest-alleviating casino gambling’s social cost by limiting demand, the operation of Section 1304 and its regulatory regime is so pierced by exemptions and inconsistencies that the government cannot hope to exonerate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.248" offset="1030697">Federal law prohibits a broadcaster from carrying advertising about privately operated commercial casino gambling, regardless of the station’s or the casino’s location, but exempts advertising about state-run casinos, certain occasional commercial casino gambling and tribal casino gambling even if the broadcaster is located in or broadcasts to a jurisdiction with the strictest of antigambling policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.569" offset="1132052">Moreover, the FCC prohibits references to "Vegas-style games" but permits casinos to advertise "Vegas-style excitement".</text>
            <text syncTime="272.533" offset="1175834">The government cannot adequately justify the distinctions it has drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.204" offset="1190567">For example, the government admits that tribal casinos offer precisely the same types of gambling as do private commercial casinos and indicates the direct regulation of such gambling is effective in combating the social ills with which Congress was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.676" offset="1252425">While there maybe valid reasons for imposing commercial regulations on non-Indian businesses that differ from those imposed and tribal enterprises, it does not follow that those differences justify abridging non-Indians freedom of speech more severely than the freedom of their tribal competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.722" offset="1320656">For the power to prohibit or to regulate particular conduct does not necessarily include the power to prohibit or regulate speech about that conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.778" offset="1356810">Considering the manner in which Section 1304 and its exceptions operate and the scope of the speech proscribe, the Government’s second asserted interest assisting States with policies that disfavor private casinos provides no more convincing basis for upholding the regulation than the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.965" offset="1425564">In sum, respondents cannot overcome the First Amendment’s presumption that the speaker and the audience, not the government are normally the best judges of the value of accurate and non-misleading information about the lawful conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.063" offset="1481989">Our judgment is unanimous, but the Chief Justice has filed a brief concurring opinion and Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
