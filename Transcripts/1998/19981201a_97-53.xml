            <text syncTime="30.781" offset="263966">Ms. Johnson's claim was dismissed by the district court on summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.784" offset="283924">That dismissal was upheld by the court of appeals on the sole issue of whether or not the statute requires proof of an improper motive on the part of the offending hospital as a prerequisite for recovery.</text>

            <text syncTime="1125.683" offset="4643551">And it's our view that that statement is entitled to deference, and that should settle the question, if there were any doubt, about the statutory language on that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1197.293" offset="4929958">I would... maybe it might help, though, because you used the term stabilized, to point out that under the statute, there really are two kind of polar ways of looking at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.039" offset="4964962">One is if you look at the definition of stabilization, it's defined in terms of assuring that there's no deterioration of the... of the patient's condition during the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.337" offset="5006131">And that suggests that the term stabilization is not... and the Secretary has said this... is not a medical term under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.309" offset="5034030">It's a defined statutory term and it doesn't really make sense necessarily to talk about somebody being stabilized outside of the context of a particular transfer that's contemplated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.746" offset="5071855">So, under that view, which I think is probably petitioner's view, that duty operates at the end of the hospital stay pretty much no matter how long it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.093" offset="5109158">There would be another view I think that... that in order for the stabilization requirement to apply, the hospital must determine that there's an emergency medical condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.329" offset="5146147">And I think another possible reading of the statute would be that if the hospital at some point determines that there's no longer an emergency medical condition, that that would terminate the hospital's obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.677" offset="5195571">So, I think there's at least those two polar ways of looking at the statute and there's probably some in between cases too, and the Secretary would like the opportunity to institute a rule making and look at the question thoroughly and develop a view on the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.758" offset="5255861">So, for that reason, as well as the belated nature of respondent's presentation of the issues and the fact that there probably are some unresolved factual disputes on which the... these other two issues are premised, the Government believes that the Court shouldn't reach those issues in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1328.439" offset="5454601">And we do think as hospitals that there are certainly certain situations where there are absolute obligations that are imposed upon us, for instance, in providing some form of a screening examination where an inquiry into the hospital's motive is simply not an appropriate inquiry, and on that basis alone, it's easy for us to set aside the actual motive test.</text>

            <text syncTime="1677.861" offset="6852257">Or, two, you decide you're going to transfer the patient to somewhere else and you're going to provide that patient with stabilizing treatment, realizing that that's designed simply to get the patient from facility A to facility B without a significant deterioration in the... in the patient's condition during that... just during that period.</text>

            <text syncTime="2566.812" offset="10408044">And so, each day we've had a doctor there saying that there is some risk that the transfer will hurt the woman, and... and therefore that definition wouldn't seem to have been satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.670" offset="10455483">And that could, I guess in principle, extend for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.812" offset="10468021">But... but if it does extend for years, isn't it true that each day that definition of stabilize was not satisfied and therefore the hospital cannot transfer the woman?</text>

            <text syncTime="2593.878" offset="10516296">I don't dispute that... that there is a technical reading of the statute that would support that particular outcome, but it is... but the... but it is so counter both to State law and to... to intuitive judgment about what a hospital would do that I don't think it's within intendment of this particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.552" offset="10591006">I mean, I don't disagree that you can interpret the definition of stabilize.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.196" offset="10601559">But I think the... the more natural reading of that term in context is designed to say what we're going to focus on is that immediate transfer out of the emergency medical condition, and that this is not a statute that remotely suggests what you do once you... you place the entire arm of State tort law and malpractice law around the patient by admitting the patient into the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.870" offset="10700302">And that's where I think this statute clearly is intended to draw the line, which is why even though you could read the language of stabilized out of context to apply to that situation, it's clear to me Congress didn't mean it and Congress wouldn't have needed it because if you have a patient who's getting hospital orders to stay in the hospital, I mean, there are more State law violations arising out of the transfer of that patient than you can shake a stick at.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.666" offset="10795493">And... and it's clear to me that Federal law doesn't need... the Department of HHS and... and two different private cause of action in order to deal with that kind of a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.581" offset="10831124">That's... you know, there's nothing in this statute that remotely suggests that Congress meant to significantly alter the relationship between Federal and State law in this setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.988" offset="10868740">And it's not a provision, as I said, that goes away at some point and then resurfaces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.273" offset="10893922">There's nothing in the language that... that justifies that kind of... of an interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.977" offset="10916701">I think I've exhausted the Court's questions, if not the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.180" offset="10937494">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.440" offset="10938539">If there are no further questions, I urge the Court to affirm.</text>

            <text syncTime="2707.305" offset="10970095">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and I would like to point out just a few things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.489" offset="10986813">First of all, the interpretation of the statute that is proposed by the hospital is focused strictly at... at patient dumping from the front end of the hospital, basically the stories where hospitals turn patients away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.376" offset="11034356">Its interpretation totally ignores situations that are equally reprehensible, and that is the dumping of patients at the other end of the spectrum, patients that are hospitalized and for whatever reason the hospital makes a decision that this patient is going to be transferred.</text>

            <text syncTime="2738.957" offset="11096632">But that may not be the focus of Congress' intent in this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.340" offset="11118157">It may well have been enacted to focus at the front end of the emergency, the woman in labor who's turned away--</text>

            <text syncTime="2754.117" offset="11157341">That's the indication anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="2756.599" offset="11167267">--Yes, that... that may be true, Justice O'Connor, that that was the primary focus of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.731" offset="11187747">Wanda Johnson's situation is... is a perfect example of why Federal law was needed in this circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.059" offset="11221079">As we... as we discussed earlier, the Sixth Circuit decided that under State law Wanda Johnson had no cause of action against the hospital because this medical student who made this decision, even if that decision was negligent and the subject of... of State malpractice law, did not create a cause of action against the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.389" offset="11294431">So, if in fact Wanda Johnson was dumped from the transfer end, without this statute Wanda Johnson has no cause of action against the hospital, only against a medical student who made a decision to invoke a transfer of this patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.400" offset="11358379">I would point out also that even if the Court were to accept any of the arguments that are made by the hospital in this case, there still exists substantial factual issues that would... would compel this Court to reverse the case and send it back down for review by the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.421" offset="11430477">Contrary to what the hospital argues, there is a clear factual issue as to whether or not an emergency medical condition existed with Wanda Johnson when she was transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.048" offset="11469034">The only evidence that the hospital cites is the testimony of Dr. Miller who is the only physician who speaks in terms of an emergency medical condition, and Dr. Miller quite candidly admits in his deposition that he was on vacation during the entire month when Wanda Johnson was transferred and that his decision was based on his review of the medical records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.510" offset="11538833">On the other hand, Dr. John Stuy, who was Wanda Johnson's treating physician in Indianapolis, testified at length in this case, and his testimony can be read to the effect that Wanda Johnson did suffer an emergency medical condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.439" offset="11594630">Now, he doesn't come right out and say, I've read the statute and she suffered an emergency medical condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.313" offset="11610095">But he says she needed the availability of treatment that hospitals provide and because she was outside of the confines of those people who could provide that treatment, her condition got substantially worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.003" offset="11664848">So, there... there are factual issues that would have to be resolved even if any of the arguments that the hospital makes in this case were adopted and accepted by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.808" offset="11700061">Finally, I would point out to the Court that there is at least one other... that one other interpretation of the... the definition of a determination by a hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.345" offset="11746245">The section (b) of the statute does say if a hospital determines that this condition exists, and the hospital would argue that that is synonymous with actual knowledge, and I'm not sure that that is necessarily the interpretation that could be placed upon that... that section of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.186" offset="11813537">I think it would be very reasonable to assume, considering the context that it's placed in, that that would also include situations where the hospital was intentionally ignorant of important facts that would have borne on that determination.</text>
