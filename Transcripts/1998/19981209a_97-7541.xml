            <text syncTime="2041.572" offset="8314881">It seems to me they're totally different situations, and I do understand why when a person takes the stand the prosecution ought to be able to get everything out of them, but where the person has pleaded guilty, I don't know why the prosecution must have a right to insist that that person plunge the sword in still further.</text>

            <text syncTime="2067.382" offset="8418117">What occurs when this Court has examined the question of what is the scope of a waiver when a defendant takes the stand is, the Court asks, what is reasonably going to be furthered as a policy matter by saying the privilege either goes this far or it ends, and it's concluded that in a criminal trial, or in any trial, when a witness testifies, the fairness of the proceeding requires that all matters that are relevant to cross-examination be deemed to be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.641" offset="8535250">In this context, there are also very strong reasons to consider the scope of the waiver to be at the minimum all of the conduct that is bound up in the offense to which the defendant pleads guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.740" offset="8587599">Let me highlight two of the reasons, apart from the generic reason that the plea of guilty itself is an admission that the defendant has engaged in conduct that violates the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.254" offset="8625634">The first is that, at the Rule 11 colloquy, the judge does have a obligation to make sure that the defendant is fully aware of the facts that are alleged to constitute a violation of the law, and agrees that his conduct constitutes that violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.786" offset="8691776">To perform that responsibility adequately, the judge must have the authority to say, look, you know, I've heard what this charge is, it's, for example, murder, but I want to hear you tell me in your own words what you did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.183" offset="8741408">Now, the defendant may have killed a person with a gun, and the defendant may also be a felon, and thereby admitting that the defendant had a gun would also implicate the defendant in an independent crime, a section 922 violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.992" offset="8792608">Now, the defendant can't realistically say, I'm going to tell you, judge--</text>

            <text syncTime="3307.864" offset="13380128">Hardly any... none to my knowledge... capital prosecutions are resolved by a plea of guilty to the offense and trial on sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.330" offset="13409908">It is theoretically possible, but most jurisdictions put the question to the trier of fact, and most capital defendants will take their chance at acquittal or conviction of a lesser offense rather than plead guilty and place all of their bets in the sentencing hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3335.483" offset="13490574">No, that's true, and at that point they've avoided the possibility of a capital hearing altogether, but if they plead guilty to a capital offense and then stand capital sentencing, that would be quite an extraordinary situation in my experience.</text>

            <text syncTime="3352.843" offset="13560060">That would depend, Justice Ginsburg, on how this Court ultimately resolved the question of what an Alford plea really is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.080" offset="13596945">In the Federal system, Alford pleas are extraordinarily rare.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.412" offset="13610319">They are susceptible of being characterized as a plea of guilty, which the Court seems to have done in the Alford case itself, but they are also susceptible as being characterized as pleas of no contest in which the defendant is admitting that these charges have been made, the facts have been put before the court, and I believe that I'm innocent, but I'm going to allow the court to enter judgment against me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.271" offset="13709689">If the Court categorized the Alford plea into the basket of guilty pleas, then my position would be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.003" offset="13736648">It is the legal effect of the guilty plea to accomplish a waiver of the privilege within the zone of facts encompassed by the plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.308" offset="13765905">If the Court instead viewed this as no... it's really more like a plea of nolo contendere in the historical sense, then I don't think that it would necessarily amount to an admission of commission of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.628" offset="13819194">It's really consent to the imposition of criminal punishment.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3421.331" offset="13833928">So then the Fifth Amendment privilege would have been retained at the sentencing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="3426.136" offset="13853154">I think that it's possible to conclude that it would have been retained, at least on the theory that we have articulated before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.970" offset="13884501">Alford pleas are so anomalous in the standard run of guilty pleas that it's tricky to say exactly what they are, but the normal guilty plea unquestionably is a full-fledged waiver of the privilege against compelled self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.050" offset="13952837">Indeed, it is self-incrimination, and we simply take the view that once one comes forward to the court to do that, you cannot withhold the details of the offense to which you have pleaded guilty.</text>

            <text syncTime="3462.929" offset="14000380">Are you... is your position different from Judge Slovener, because as I recall she didn't put Rule 11 into her analysis at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3474.236" offset="14045624">I think, Justice Ginsburg, that the Third Circuit went back and forth between two different rationales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.470" offset="14074568">One rationale begins with the guilty plea analysis that we have stretched out in this Court to articulate more factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.176" offset="14109363">The other part of the Third Circuit's rationale seems to be the notion that there is no privilege against self-incrimination with respect to facts that can serve to enhance your sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.096" offset="14160981">The logical implication of that position is broader than the position that we've taken in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.240" offset="14185640">The logical implication of that position is that a defendant who goes to trial and does not take the stand and is convicted would then forfeit any Fifth Amendment privilege with respect to the criminal sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.437" offset="14238408">The Third Circuit didn't have to confront that situation, and I do not know what the Third Circuit would have answered to that question, but there are enough elements in the Third Circuit decision that are consistent with our position, so I think it's fair to say that this was and is a guilty plea case.</text>
