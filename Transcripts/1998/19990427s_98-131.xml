            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="85708">The opinion of the Court in No. 98-131, United States versus Sun-Diamond Growers of California will be announced by Justice Scalia.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="12.063" stopTime="367.344">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="12.063" offset="133878">This case comes to us on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.351" offset="159060">The United States through an independent counsel indicted respondent Sun-Diamond Growers for giving gifts to former Secretary of Agriculture, Michael Espy, in violation of the illegal gratuity statute 18 U.S.C Section 201(c)(1)(A).</text>
            <text syncTime="35.868" offset="229172">That statute prohibits giving or receiving gifts "for or because of any official act performed or to be performed" by a public official.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.997" offset="281626">At trial the jury was instructed that respondent violated the statute as he gave gifts to Espy because of his official position.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.404" offset="315272">Furthermore, the jury was explicitly told that the government need not prove a link between the gifts and any particular official act.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.349" offset="351008">The Court of Appeals reversed this conviction and remanded for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.706" offset="368457">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.846" offset="385071">The illegal gratuity statute Section 201(c) is part of that Section the United States Code that also contains the bribery statute Section 201(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="84.799" offset="424882">The latter requires proof that something of value was given or received "to influence" any official act.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.063" offset="453930">It requires a quid pro quo, the act in exchange for the gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.282" offset="474828">The Illegal Gratuity Statute before us here on the other hand requires a showing only that something of value was given for or because of any official act.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.867" offset="513176">It does not require a quid pro quo, but prohibits rewards for acts already taken or for future acts which an official has already committed to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.040" offset="553822">Both statutes however require a connection between the gift and an official act.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.247" offset="578691">The language that Section 201(c) uses for or because of any official act is certainly susceptible of the indeterminate meaning urged here by the independent counsel and by Justice Department as amicus.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.904" offset="633235">So that it would apply to a gift given for any unspecified official act, or more generally because of the recipient's official position.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.618" offset="672105">One can ask, for example, do you like any composer?</text>
            <text syncTime="149.586" offset="684017">Meaning, do you like all composers, no matter what their identity, or one can ask do you like any composer?</text>
            <text syncTime="155.618" offset="708154">Meaning, do you like any particular composer?</text>
            <text syncTime="158.477" offset="719543">The latter more specifying meaning of any seems to us the more normal one.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.728" offset="740546">Moreover, the consequences of the government's interpretation are quite extreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.932" offset="757368">It would criminalize, for example, a high school principal's gift of a school baseball cap to the Secretary of Education by reason of his office on the occasion of the latter's visit to the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.356" offset="803030">When Congress has wanted to adopt such a broad prohibition on gift giving it has done so explicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.919" offset="825287">For example, other provisions of Chapter 11 of Title 18, the Chapter entitled Bribery Graft and Conflicts of Interest, make it a crime to give or receive any supplementation of an executive official's salary without regard to the purpose of the payment, or for a bank employee to give a bank examiner, or for a bank examiner to receive from a bank employee any longer gratuity without regard to the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.883" offset="929150">These provisions make their broad and categorical suite quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.992" offset="945659">We think it unlikely that the phrase for or because of any official act was meant to achieve the same goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.672" offset="968333">Finally, and perhaps most important, a narrow rather than a sweeping prohibition is more compatible with the fact that Section 201(c)(1)(A) is merely one strand of an intricate web of regulations; both administrative and criminal, governing the acceptance of gifts and other self enriching actions by public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.416" offset="1047328">Various provisions of the United States Court, for example, make it a crime to give or receive compensation in consideration for a federal employee's representational assistance to any one involved in the proceeding in which the United States has a direct and substantial interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.763" offset="1104692">Or a federal employee to act as agent or attorney for any one appearing before virtually any government tribunal in connection with the matter in which the United States has a direct and substantial interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.885" offset="1145235">Or various types of federal employees to engage in various activities after completion of their federal service, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.454" offset="1175432">The criminal statutes are just the tip of the iceberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.408" offset="1187239">Each branch of the Federal Government has detailed rules and regulations governing its employees' receipts of gratuities.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.202" offset="1218482">All of these regulations and some of the statutes contain exceptions for various kinds of gratuities given by various donors for various purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.817" offset="1256934">Many of those exceptions would be snares for the unwary, given that there are no exceptions to the broad prohibitions that the government claims is imposed by Section 201(c)(1)(A).</text>
            <text syncTime="304.248" offset="1302596">This is in short an area where precisely targeted prohibitions are common place, and where more general prohibitions are qualified by numerous exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.639" offset="1344183">Given that reality, a statute in this field that can linguistically be interpreted to be either a meat axe or a scalpel should reasonably be taken to be the latter.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.588" offset="1383994">Absent the text that clearly requires it, we ought not to expand this one piece of the regulatory puzzle so dramatically as to make many other pieces misfits.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.450" offset="1427461">Thus, the District Court's instructions in this case were erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.181" offset="1442404">They allowed the jury to convict on a showing that gifts were motivated by Secretary Espy's capacity to act in any unspecified matters affecting respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.955" offset="1481483">The jury did not have to find a connection between any particular gift and any particular official act, which is what the law requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.275" offset="1514710">That error, moreover, was not harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.759" offset="1524741">Accordingly, we affirm the DC Circuit's decision, remanding the case for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.954" offset="1545430">The decision of the Court is unanimous.</text>
