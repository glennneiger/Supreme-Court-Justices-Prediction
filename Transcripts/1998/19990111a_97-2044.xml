            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="153289">We'll hear argument first in No. 97-2044, United States v. Haggar Apparel Company.</text>

            <text syncTime="9.106" offset="189651">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.891" offset="200832">In 1978, this Court held in the Zenith Radio case that substantial deference should be given to Treasury interpretations of the Tariff Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.545" offset="235418">In the present case, the Federal circuit, without even citing Zenith Radio, held precisely to the contrary and concluded that no deference should be given to Treasury interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.435" offset="275020">The court concluded that a 1980 statute directed the Court of International Trade to reach the correct decision in customs cases and that this statutory obligation was inconsistent with affording any deference to Treasury interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.529" offset="335310">Respondent has abandoned that reasoning in this Court, and the reasoning of the court of appeals is manifestly incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.683" offset="359970">The statute on which the court of appeals relied is 28 U.S.C. 2643(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="57.603" offset="383689">That statute merely provides procedural options for the Court of International Trade in situations where the evidence presented to that court is not sufficient for it to reach the correct decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.477" offset="427157">In adopting the statute in 1980, the legislative history made clear that Congress merely intended to provide to the Court of International Trade the same kind of remand and retrial authority possessed generally by Federal district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.718" offset="480133">Certainly nothing in the history of that provision reflects any intention by Congress to abandon the principle of deference to Treasury interpretations that this Court had articulated only 2 years prior to that date.</text>

            <text syncTime="118.057" offset="625478">The Federal circuit concluded that they could ignore the regulation altogether, that the regulation was to be given no deference, was in effect a null and void act, because, the court reasoned, that the Court of International Trade was supposed to reach the correct decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="140.505" offset="715235">When you have an expert body like the Treasury that knows a lot about it, you would give a lot of deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.326" offset="742507">Except, if you were an expert body that knew just as much about it, then why would they have some special power to persuade?</text>

            <text syncTime="154.830" offset="772600">Well, if... if by the expert body you're referring to you're referring to the Court of International Trade, the Court of International Trade is a specialized court just like the Tax Court, and the Tax Court, just like the Court of International Trade, has been directed by this Court in decisions such as National Muffler Dealers and for the Court of International Trade in the Zenith Radio case to defer to the agency's reasonable interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="245.468" offset="1135075">The high Chevron is where the agency is given an express authority to interpret a particular statutory provision and makes a substantive legislative rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.676" offset="1171960">And then it's to be treated as valid if it's not arbitrary and capricious and clearly inconsistent with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.127" offset="1193694">There's a low Chevron that doesn't require any statutory authority to adopt rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.781" offset="1212398">It's based simply on the implied authority of the agency to interpret and implement the statute that Congress has designated for it to administer.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.637" offset="1247820">What we have here and also in the Internal Revenue Code is something in between.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.593" offset="1283660">For example, 19 U.S.C. 1624 is... provides a general authority to the Treasury to adopt any necessary rules under the Tariff Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="327.602" offset="1463696">There is the standard of what I call the high Chevron standard, which is perhaps the Skidmore test you're referring to, which is when the agency has specific rulemaking power granted by Congress for a specific subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.659" offset="1507895">That's the high deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.345" offset="1514582">The lower deference in Chevron doesn't require any specific grant of statutory power.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.713" offset="1532136">It's based on what the Court described in Chevron as the implied authority to interpret and implement a scheme when Congress has told the agency to administer it.</text>

            <text syncTime="369.013" offset="1629312">There's a parallel provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.365" offset="1634745">The 1624 that I referred to is parallel to the general interpretive authority in the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.434" offset="1655016">In addition, there is a specific interpretive authority for classification issues which, of course, this case involves.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.255" offset="1682288">It authorizes the Treasury adopting the rules and regulations for the classification of goods, classification and assessment of tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.842" offset="1708620">Now, respondent's new argument, the one that he didn't make below but is presenting to this Court, is that... that this... that a statutory authority to issue the classification rules is limited in 1502 by a clause at the end of it which says, classification rules at the port... various ports of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.823" offset="1788554">And respondent, without any authority whatever, says that just reading that, they can tell that that means that it doesn't permit rules that apply to importers, that it only applies to Customs officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.797" offset="1832440">Well, that's illogical and it's also inconsistent with the longstanding principle of this Court since 1809 in Vowell and M'Clean that tariff duties only arise at the ports of entry, in the words of that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.521" offset="1879356">So, a rule that classifies goods at the ports of entry applies directly to importers because that's where the duties arise, that's where the goods are classified and valued, and where the duties are assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.877" offset="1924705">Respondent's new argument... I think I should, you know, put it in... in its framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.012" offset="1945289">Respondent's new argument is that because the Court of International Trade is to make a de novo determination of liability, that that is inconsistent with giving deference to the Treasury's interpretation of the legal issues involved in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.354" offset="2006625">In fact, respondent goes so far as to say that whenever a court is to make a de novo determination of liability, it is to ignore agency regulations even when Congress has expressly authorized the agency to adopt interpretive rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.931" offset="2060959">That... that suggestion is radical and it's flatly inconsistent with general case law of this Court and, in particular, it's inconsistent with the customs and tax litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.906" offset="2104845">In customs and tax cases, Federal courts have long been charged with the responsibility of making independent factual determinations, of making determinations of law and applying the facts to the law to determine ultimately independently the amount of tax or customs duty owed.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.581" offset="2167539">The Federal district courts do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.200" offset="2174017">The Court of Federal Claims does it, the Court of International Trade and the Tax Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="1549.688" offset="6351937">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.025" offset="6365312">The Government suggests to you that the... this may be a case of high Chevron or low Chevron.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.077" offset="6385583">I submit to you that this is a case of no Chevron.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.513" offset="6395300">And the reason for that is that you cannot determine whether or not any kind of deference is due to the agency's interpretation simply by citing other statutory schemes or cases that interpret other statutory schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.487" offset="6443157">In order to decide in a particular case whether or not respect is due to the regulations or interpretations of the particular agency, it's absolutely essential to examine the source of regulatory authority, the nature of the judicial proceeding that Congress provided for, and in this case take a very hard look at the regulation itself because it expresses as plainly, as anything can, the very limited nature of the authority that Customs purported to exercise in this particular context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.404" offset="6550886">And if you follow those three sources of law, they all point in precisely the same direction, which is that Customs never has had, in the 200 years of its existence, the kind of authority that the Government purports to claim that it has now on the basis of an utterly a historic analysis of this particular problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.950" offset="6620998">Instead, what we know is that Customs binds its own people at their ports of entry, and that's all Customs purports to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.122" offset="6649733">It does not purport to bind either this Court or the Court of International Trade or the importer when it adopts regulations such as section 10.16 that's at issue in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1634.811" offset="6692469">But, Mr. Phillips, an agency certainly doesn't have to go through notice and comment rulemaking in order to bind it's own people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.298" offset="6718383">It just issues instructions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1642.781" offset="6724339">It does need to go through comment and notice rulemaking when it adopts a regulation pursuant to headnote 11 which provides the procedures with regard to the admission, okay, that's applicable to this particular kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.725" offset="6780136">The procedures with regard to admission are things like inspections, what's required to inspect to make a determination with regard to the classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.395" offset="6806781">That is a, quote, substantive rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.895" offset="6816812">It's procedural in nature, but it is a delegation of authority and it does require the notice and comment rulemaking because you have to comply with those specific procedures in headnote 11 in order to be allowed to make a protest that's valid under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.820" offset="6872505">But with respect to the rest of the rules, it's absolutely clear they were not intended to be substantive rules or in any way to bind anybody, and that's because Customs doesn't have the authority to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.343" offset="6906569">And... and that is as clear as can be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.812" offset="6916496">I think it's as clear as can be in the... the sentence in section 10.11 of the regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1949.561" offset="7951467">In section 20a, where we talk about section 2638, it's an extraordinary provision because it says all you need to do is present the fact that you protest and that's sufficient to justify allowing you to go to court to challenge it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.453" offset="8007056">That means that you can present one set of arguments to the Customs and a completely different set of arguments to the court, and the court reviews those de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.524" offset="8039343">And it seems to me an extraordinary concept that I could... you know, I could completely mislead Customs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1988.467" offset="8107157">And therefore, it seems quite unlikely that Congress would have, in that kind of a scheme, intended to allow Customs regulations which just generally inform the Customs agents how to proceed, what the law is, and that that is in some sense binding on either importers or on the... or on the... or on... or on the courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2481.634" offset="10079820">And so you have... and let me go back to the rulemaking authority because I think it's very important to understand under 1502.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.188" offset="10101971">Not only does it only... I mean, that language at the ports of entry is terribly pivotal language, and it... and it goes back to the distinction of the Zenith case that Mr. Jones made a great deal about in his... in his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.996" offset="10149201">If you look at the Zenith opinion, the Court says in Zenith, it describes the grant of regulatory authority and it's a broad authority to deal with all duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.352" offset="10186608">But you know what's missing in the language of the Zenith opinion is any reference to the ports of entry, and the reason for that is clear, is because the grant of authority in countervailing duties cases, even in 1979, was significantly broader.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.175" offset="10237913">And then in the 1980 statute, we have this extraordinary de novo review that's provided with respect to Customs in the classification context, and Congress then dealt with the countervailing duties, consistent with this Court's decision in Zenith, and said that that's based on an administrative record and that that's based on... on ordinary standards of administrative review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.358" offset="10326625">So, Congress, even with respect to Customs... I want to be clear about this because one of the things the Government challenges us on is that somehow we are saying that Customs, as an entity, is divested of any kind of... of respect or deference as a consequence of our decision... of our arguments here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.117" offset="10385661">And nothing could be further from the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.000" offset="10393289">Again, I think you have to look at the three sources of... of information with respect to what Congress intended.</text>

            <text syncTime="3306.029" offset="13377309">The Court has held that in many cases and has specifically held it in... in the one case that respondent cites as his leading authority, Adams Fruit Company v. Barrett.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.551" offset="13419418">In Adams Fruit Company, the Court held that there was a de novo review, that the agency couldn't interpret the scope of the judicial remedy, but that that didn't deprive the agency of its authority to make substantive interpretations of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.859" offset="13468633">And the Court went on to say that in that de novo exclusive judicial proceeding, the Court would defer to the agency's reasoned interpretations of the substantive scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="3364.631" offset="13611784">Well, I don't think that there are facts in this case that involve pressing a little longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.601" offset="13631637">In fact, the facts show that they didn't do that, that that's not practical.</text>

            <text syncTime="3376.605" offset="13659640">But let me answer your... your question more generically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.159" offset="13673851">A quibble about the application of the permapressing rule to this case doesn't denigrate the... the validity of the substantive provision of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.265" offset="13714288">It defines acts incidental to assembly to not include significant processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.503" offset="13731216">The Court can rely on the... on the general standard even if it's confused about the application of the example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.922" offset="13760891">And the general standard plainly applies when... when... on the findings of the trial court that there was significant capital, significant time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.612" offset="13799656">It was unrelated to assembly and it was for the purpose of improvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.547" offset="13811464">The trial court said that these factors militate against a duty allowance, but the court balanced them to reach a different conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.486" offset="13839153">Well, the agency's balance is different, and as this Court has held in many situations, the agency doesn't have to establish that its regulation is the only reasonable interpretation or that it's the one the Court would adopt in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.461" offset="13891085">It's sufficient, under Chevron, that the agency made a reasoned exposition of the text consistent with its purpose in history.</text>
