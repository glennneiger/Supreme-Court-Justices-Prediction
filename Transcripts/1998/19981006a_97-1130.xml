            <text syncTime="32.311" offset="271847">The Federal Circuit held that Wayne Pfaff had forfeited his right to a patent because he had violated the on sale bar provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.587" offset="304971">The appellate court reached that conclusion because it failed to construe the statute properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.249" offset="323674">Properly construed, the grace period of the on sale bar provision cannot start until there is an invention fully completed by reduction to practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.639" offset="369232">There are three reasons why the statute should be so construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.190" offset="383442">First, for many decades the regional appellate circuits consistently had construed the on sale bar provision to require at least reduction to practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.549" offset="428791">That body of judicial authority spans two relevant reenactments of the on sale bar provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.972" offset="454496">Second, the policy balance selected by Congress in 1839 for the on sale bar provision emphasized that inventors were to have an easy to calculate period of limitations based on an event of significance to inventors.</text>

            <text syncTime="199.931" offset="942358">Going back to the Alexander Milburn case, about half way through that decision the Court made it clear that the person who had described in his patent but not claimed was not in fact the inventor for the description purpose, and the answer is, in going on just further, conception is always the first step, but as this Court has said in a number of cases going back to Corona Cord, Symington, and starting back in earlier cases, conception is the first step, reduction to practice is when you show that something really will work.</text>

            <text syncTime="2153.772" offset="8757777">What 102(b) says to us is that when the invention exists, and when it is on sale 1 year prior to the date of filing, then it is invalid, and so we must fundamentally go back to 102(b) and, unless we are to say that the fundamental principle, I think, that has been with us for a very long time in patent law that was noted in Bonito Boats and was well stated by Judge Learned Hand, is that we have an important policy in encouraging inventors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.448" offset="8920468">Once the invention is in place, we encourage the inventors to file their patent application, and that fundamental policy was noted in Bonito Boats, and it is exactly why the on sale bar, the on sale portion of the on sale bar should not be read to allow the inventor to control the time when the period starts to run by deciding when he or she will reduce it to practice, or he or she will deliver the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.460" offset="9044497">You have run counter to that fundamental policy... let me suggest that the entire reduction to practice notion is a notion that has grown up not in the on sale bar clause area at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.770" offset="9105728">We have two major categories of conditions when you look at 102.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.193" offset="9127462">The first category of condition let's call priority, because it says, let's look at the time of invention and decide at that point in time what was the state of the art, what was already out there?</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.053" offset="9178871">Is this something novel, or was it already there?</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.105" offset="9191096">That's what we look at in 102(a), that's what we look at in 102(b), that's what we look at in 102(g).</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.031" offset="9218786">In the priority cases, the way the law has developed, and it's developed appropriately, I think, we definitely have, as the question to establish this morning, we look at when the invention was made in terms of when was the conception complete?</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.860" offset="9286078">We have always done that at least since the middle of the last century.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.694" offset="9301438">So when we're asking that question, we encourage, of course inventors to remember as well as they can how far back the invention went, and in that situation this Court has always been, and other courts have been properly skeptical of the mere memory of the inventor as to how far back he actually thought through this invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.321" offset="9399971">So the courts developed this notion of a reduction to practice, and the reduction to practice helps confirm as a matter of proof that not only was there a conception, but that within a reasonable time... this is the notion of diligence to reduce to practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.724" offset="9477503">Within a reasonable time we can see the actual invention or the patent application, one of those two things.</text>

            <text syncTime="2516.421" offset="10208305">You put this... exactly this subject in my mind, that a company goes and shows a business... an inventor a very, very complicated computer and says, we need some little part in here, and although that sounds easy, it's very difficult, and the inventor says, I know I can invent it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.362" offset="10284060">That's not a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.812" offset="10285940">I mean, it will be this way roughly, and they describe it in fairly good detail but not in such detail that you could go make it right then and there, and so they sign a contract for it expecting it will take 2 or 3 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.112" offset="10331080">Now the time begins to pass, and the inventor tries 50 different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.205" offset="10351456">You know, first this, first that, and he isn't quite certain which is the best.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.556" offset="10368905">Now, may 40 of those 50 would qualify as inventions once he's written them down, but he isn't going to go actually make it until he's sure he's got the best one.</text>

            <text syncTime="2583.303" offset="10475903">Does he then have to go and file a patent application immediately, possibly having hundreds of patent applications, just because it may turn out he's got the best one and he doesn't really know for 3 or 4 years, and that's why he hasn't reduced it to practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3150.273" offset="12743749">--Justice Kennedy, I'd like to answer your question from two perspectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.555" offset="12756915">Let's look first at what the inventor understands under our test, and that is, if he has conceived of an invention, if he's ready to patent it, then he knows he has 1 year from the date he places it on sale to apply for that patent, and that's a clear rule for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.476" offset="12816579">He knows at that point that once I say, Eureka, I know what I want to do here, I understand it, I can reduce it to practice, I can make an enabling disclosure, then he knows if he offers it for sale the clock is ticking, and he has 1 year to get that patent application in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.345" offset="12872063">Now, the case is also going to arise, in the case such as we have here, where a party is seeking to invalidate the patent... and his perspective is going to be quite different on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.932" offset="12914381">He's going to look at what proof do I have that the inventor had placed this item on sale, and it really is an evidentiary question at that point in terms of whether what was on sale was what was ultimately identified in the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.891" offset="12966208">For instance, a simple case of this is the mechanical drawing situation we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.824" offset="12989927">We think this case is clearly covered by our test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.856" offset="13002048">What the challenger says is, look, we know this was on sale because the engineering diagrams that you prepared and submitted to the purchaser are the very same diagrams that we submitted with the application of a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.485" offset="13052621">Now, the question that you're concerned with, I believe, is the situation of, well, what if there's a change along the way as the product is developed, and certainly that's commonplace in today's commercial markets, that there'd be the back and forth, the interchange between the buyer and seller that might lead to modifications of the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.946" offset="13114479">If it's an obvious change, then the same bar applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.400" offset="13132242">We simply apply the so called obviousness test to the item that was originally offered for sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="3262.009" offset="13190652">I'm concerned from the standpoint of the prospective patentee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.221" offset="13203505">How does he know whether there's going to be a change along the way?</text>

            <text syncTime="3288.297" offset="13295874">Now, it might be that he finds an improvement to this invention, that he actually sees a way to make it better, or to improve it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3311.935" offset="13390437">If the change is radical, then he knows that, in fact, a new 1 year period will start to run and, following your rule, he will file a new application.</text>

            <text syncTime="3323.740" offset="13437562">That's how these rules operate, and it's important to see that this is... it places the control over the on sale bar within the hands of the inventor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.175" offset="13467341">Once the inventor knows what rule applies, he can act accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.738" offset="13481552">The question also arose with regard to what if, if what the inventor is really selling is, shall we describe as a half baked idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.046" offset="13514780">He's offering something for sale, but he hasn't fully formulated in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.297" offset="13531811">Now, the inventor that does that runs a risk that someone might say that, well, in fact, you knew what you were selling, and the on sale bar should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.863" offset="13562114">He can protect himself in that situation simply by providing in the terms of the contract that he is providing development services, or an R&amp;D contract, or he's entering into a joint ventureship with the party for whom he's developing this.</text>

            <text syncTime="3392.888" offset="13714146">The inventor also has to be concerned about the possibility that other inventors might come along to claim the same invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.982" offset="13738597">Now, if he wants to protect himself and protect his priority, then he's going to need to do one of several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.136" offset="13763152">1) he's going to have to actually reduce to practice... there is this incentive to encourage people to reduce to practice... or he's going to file a patent application ahead of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.912" offset="13802336">The marketplace itself actually polices this in very important ways, because the inventor, if he wants to take advantage of the patent system, he does have to move quickly and clarify what he's selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.240" offset="13847580">What's more, the marketplace also encourages the proper use of our tests because, as you said, Justice Scalia, a buyer is not going to buy a pig in a poke.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.509" offset="13892719">He's going to want to know what he's bought.</text>
