            <text syncTime="0.000">The opinion of the Court in No. 98-347, Clinton versus Goldsmith will be announced by Justice Souter.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.829">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.167">Respondent Goldsmith is a Major in the United States Air Force who disobeyed an order to tell his sex partners that he was infected with HIV and to take precautions in having sexual relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.542">He was convicted by General court-martial of lawful disobedience and sentenced to six years confinement and partial forfeiture of his salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.138">The Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed and when Goldsmith did not seek review of that decision his conviction became final.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.136">Subsequently, the Air Force invoked a newly enacted statute authorizing the President to drop from the rolls of the armed forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.060">Any officer who had both been sentenced by court-martial more than six months confinement and had served at least six months time and the Air Force notified Goldsmith that it was taking action to drop him from the rolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.968">Goldsmith did not contest the Air Forces' plan immediately, but instead petitioned to Court of Criminal Appeals for extraordinary release to redress the unrelated alleged interruption of his HIV medication while in confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.463">The court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to act and it was in Goldsmith's appeal from that decision that he first asserted a claim that the Air Forces' decision to drop him violated the Ex Post Facto and Double Jeopardy Clauses of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.166">The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces responded favorably to these claims and relied on the All Writs Act to enjoin the President and other officials from dropping Goldsmiths from Air Force rolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.913">We granted certiorari and now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.034">The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces is an Article I Court with strictly circumscribes statutory authority to review findings and sentences imposed by courts-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.241">The All Writs Act authorizes the court only to issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.088">Since the Air Force's action to drop Goldsmiths in the rolls was not a finding or a sentence that was or could have been imposed in a court-marshal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.516">It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to review and hence beyond the aid of the All Writs Act in reviewing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.542">Even if the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces had some arguable bases for jurisdiction, resort to the All Writs Act would still be out of bounds, it is not a necessary or appropriate in light of the alternative remedies available to a service member demanding to be kept on the rolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.082">In this case Goldsmith could present his claim to the Air Force Board of Correction for Military Records.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.670">A civilian body with broad ranging authority to consider service members claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.698">He may also have recourse to the Federal Trial Courts by bringing either a challenge under the Administrative Procedure Act or else a claim for monetary relief under the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.530">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
