            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="86173">The second case which is not about tires is the South Central Bell Telephone Company versus The State of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.399" offset="119714">That case has to do with a franchise tax on corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.339" offset="139463">Alabama calculates its state tax differently depending on whether the corporation at issue is a foreign i.e. a non-Alabama corporation or domestic Alabama corporation and the basic question before us in that case is whether in light of the difference the franchise tax on the foreign corporation violates the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.683" offset="232877">Our holding is it does violate the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.824" offset="245415">Before we reach that question on the merit, however, we have to decide whether the Eleventh Amendment bars our consideration of the case because the Eleventh Amendment says that the federal judicial powers doesn't extend to a suit brought against the state by citizens of another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.486" offset="304034">Now, Alabama points out that this case is a suit brought by citizens of another state against this state and it before this got to this court it was only in the State Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.669" offset="344785">Nonetheless this Court has previously held that the Eleventh Amendment does not prevent this Court from reviewing State Court lawsuits where the state is a party whether it is the plaintiff or it is the defendant and we reject Alabama's Eleventh Amendment claim primarily on the basis of that precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.732" offset="413017">We also have to decide a preliminary matter whether Alabama's courts could have ruled in favor of the state mistakes for a special reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.528" offset="448230">There have been an earlier case, State Courts might have said it was somewhat ambivalent on this, rather elliptical that the eason that stated one because of the principles of res judicator, and we have to decide is that a proper ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.831" offset="533494">There is an earlier case decided by this Court that goes into that matter in some detail and basically we reject that the claim on the basis of that earlier cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.681" offset="572886">The parties in the second case were strangers to the earlier law suit and the Fourteenth Amendment prevents a state from stop a firm from using rec judicator to bar the estrangers.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.487" offset="612070">So, we finally get to the merits and we note that Alabama measures its tax on domestic corporations by the power value of the corporation stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.140" offset="654702">A number that the corporation can easily reduce if it wants, well below any actual market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.516" offset="680197">But when it measure the tax on foreign corporations, it does so by the value of the capital the foreign corporation actually implies in Alabama as determined by certain balance sheet numbers that the corporation cannot easily reduce.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.907" offset="733801">Now, that difference significantly discriminates against non Alabama corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.334" offset="755430">In our view it is not justified and under our case law the resulting discrimination makes the tax unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.560" offset="784374">The state argued that we should reconsider and abandoned our earlier case law in particular our long standing negatives Commerce Clause jurisprudents.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.966" offset="825961">But the state did not make clear it intended to make any such sweeping arguments when it filed it opposition to the petitions for certiorari and therefore we do not consider that far reaching claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.590" offset="872459">For those reasons we reverse the decision of the Alabama Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.090" offset="890431">We remand the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.278" offset="899208">Justice O'Connor has filed a concurring opinion and Justice Thomas has also filed a different concurring opinion.</text>
