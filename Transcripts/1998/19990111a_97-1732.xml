            <text syncTime="40.198" offset="310971">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="42.558" offset="320480">The question at issue in this case is whether shareholders may appeal without formal intervention when a district court approves a derivative suit settlement over their objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.135" offset="362798">We suggest that three characteristics combine in this case to give the objecting shareholders such a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.060" offset="398429">The first is that they receive notice pursuant to rule 23.1 in the form of an order to show cause why the settlement should not be approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.737" offset="437195">Second, they appeared and litigated their objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.301" offset="455376">And third, they are bound by the judgment of the district court; that is, they are subject to claim preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.847" offset="481603">When all three of those characteristics are found, this Court's cases indicate that intervention is not required in order to preserve a right to appeal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael K. Kellogg</label>
            <text syncTime="100.059" offset="550462">That's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.420" offset="551925">They did so both in writing--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="101.331" offset="555582">I mean, they weren't subject to discovery or... or to any of the other procedures that a party is subject to.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.077" offset="590482">Right?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael K. Kellogg</label>
            <text syncTime="110.438" offset="591944">--Not in this case, although a district court judge could fashion a settlement hearing in which he would allow some sort of discovery of the objecting parties' experts or... or some limited... I would think that... that the court would have discretion to do that in appropriate circumstances.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="124.996" offset="650250">But it doesn't follow automatically from the fact that you submit that the other side is entitled to treat you like a party.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="133.173" stopTime="201.181">
            <label>Mr. Michael K. Kellogg</label>
            <text syncTime="134.092" offset="686612">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.244" offset="691210">But what this Court's cases teach, starting with Johnson v. Manhattan Railway, is that in appropriate circumstances where you do appear and object and you have a right to do so and you are bound by the judgment, that you are entitled to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.216" offset="755053">That was the holding of this Court shortly before the Federal rules were passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.738" offset="773130">It was the holding in Cohen v. Young shortly after the Federal rules were passed, and it has been the uniform holding of the courts of appeals until the Seventh Circuit's decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.624" offset="812731">Now, the basic impulse behind that is the well-established principle that only parties may be bound by a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.220" offset="847108">Now, obviously there's an exception to that rule for class... class plaintiffs and derivative suit shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.473" offset="876157">But the only reason there is an exception is because non-named shareholders and absent class members are in a sense quasi parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.801" offset="909384">They are treated as such under the Federal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.813" offset="921505">That is why they get notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.095" offset="926625">That is why they have a right to appear and object, and that is why in our view they also enjoy the right to appeal.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="201.181" stopTime="202.810">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="201.181" offset="954942">What does a quasi party mean?</text>

          <turn speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="202.810" stopTime="235.672">
            <label>Mr. Michael K. Kellogg</label>
            <text syncTime="202.810" offset="961420">Well, quasi party means they are not a formal party in the sense of names on the caption or allowed to intervene pursuant to rule 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.456" offset="1004052">But this Court's cases in Blossom v. Milwaukee Railroad and Williams v. Morgan have used the term quasi parties to indicate somebody, in those instances generally a bondholder objecting to a receivership... to indicate somebody who had a right to appear before the court and was bound by the judgment, and therefore was... was viewed as having a right to appeal.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="235.672" offset="1092868">That sounds like--</text>
            <text syncTime="237.054" offset="1098406">--Is there such a thing as intervening just for the purpose of objecting to the settlement?</text>
            <text syncTime="241.906" offset="1117842">Could that... has that happened in 23.1 cases where... where objectors say, we want to intervene, Your Honor, but not for the purpose of becoming a party to displace the named representative, just to object to the judgment?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_k_kellogg" startTime="261.120" stopTime="309.922">
            <label>Mr. Michael K. Kellogg</label>
            <text syncTime="261.120" offset="1194746">It has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.639" offset="1200806">It has been allowed in some cases, though it's not clear quite how that meshes with the language of rule 24 because rule 24 does not distinguish between intervening for some purposes and intervening for others.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.527" offset="1248349">In fact, rule 24 and rule 23.1 do not mesh particularly well together when they are superimposed upon one another because, for instance, in this case we would be seeking to intervene as of right because our rights are are going to be adjudicated in this particular instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.760" offset="1321283">And yet, in order to intervene as of right under 24(a), you must show that you are not adequately represented by existing parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.677" offset="1352944">Yet, under 23.1, the district court has already made a finding that you are adequately represented by the existing derivative suit plaintiff.</text>

I am... I am struck by the fact that there's no difference between the situation of that person when there's a settlement and the situation of a shareholder when there's been an adverse judgment, which... which the... the other people choose not to take up and he would like to take up.</text>

            <text syncTime="458.229" offset="1983122">The whole point of allowing objecting shareholders to appear and object to a settlement is to prevent collusive settlements and to provide the district court with adequate information necessary to evaluate the fairness and adequacy of the settlement.</text>

            <text syncTime="498.096" offset="2142573">But again, I would note that there is... there is a certain tension between rule 24 and 23.1 because it's not clear what it means if they achieve full party status under rule 24 because ordinarily if you're a party, you can block settlement simply by declining to appeal... by declining to agree to the settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.289" offset="2219373">But in this context, that's not the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="752.483" offset="3160095">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.094" offset="3162602">Before lunch, both Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kennedy expressed some concerns about whether a derivative right, the rights of a derivative shareholder, are sufficiently personal, sufficiently significant to fall comfortably within the Court's line of cases allowing non-parties to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.616" offset="3228640">And I think that really goes to the crux of our argument, so I wanted to address that briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.830" offset="3245567">In Hawes v. Oakland, when the Court first laid down the principles for derivative suit settlements, the Court explained that there are really two suits involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.595" offset="3280571">One, there's a suit by the shareholder against his corporation for essentially having fallen down on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.088" offset="3302514">And second, there's the suit by the shareholder in the guise of the corporation against a third party who has wronged the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.895" offset="3333757">And in that sense, in that important sense, the right to bring a derivative action in appropriate circumstances is a critical part of the bundle of rights that a shareholder possesses, and that common law right has been reinforced by the protections provided in rule 23.1, specifically notice and opportunity to appear and object and the claim preclusion principles that have been developed by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.412" offset="3439814">Now, it's also important to recognize that allowing objecting shareholders to appeal serves, as I noted before lunch, the critical purposes underlying rule 23.1 of casting light on potentially collusive settlements.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.015" offset="3506269">And court after court has emphasized the importance of objecting shareholders to give a sort of adversarial context to what otherwise is a rather cozy deal cut between the nominal plaintiff and their lawyers and the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.964" offset="3562067">And there are enormous practical disincentives that will be created if shareholders have to go through the hoops of intervention in order to bring those objections to the notice of the courts because they'll be subject to mandatory disclosure and discovery obligations which could be used as a weapon to discourage objecting shareholders and increase their costs.</text>

            <text syncTime="887.637" offset="3700725">That is, they have a right to intervene only if their representation isn't adequate.</text>

            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="1149.586" offset="4748548">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.155" offset="4798808">Contrary to the court below, we believe other courts have correctly decided that objecting shareholders may appeal in a derivative action without formally intervening because they meet three conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.623" offset="4844679">They have a right to participate in the district court proceedings pursuant to notice under rule 23.1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.359" offset="4867667">They actually participate in those proceedings, and the district court's entry of the settlement decree has claim-preclusive consequences on their personal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.083" offset="4906537">Those three conditions were present in every one of the quasi party cases that we cite in our brief, and if I could direct the Court's attention to page 22 of respondents' brief, they have cited 10 cases from this Court which state the general rule that only parties or their privies may appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.878" offset="4985740">In every single one of those cases, one of those three conditions was absent, and the Court explained the general rule in terms of the absence of one of those conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.465" offset="5036104">And if I could beg the Court's indulgence for just a moment to go through those cases, six of them, the Court explained that that particular moving entity did not have a right to be in the district court proceedings or that their rights were otherwise circumscribed in a way that they sought to expand on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.346" offset="5107575">That explains Karcher, Payne v. Niles, Louisiana v. Jack--</text>

            <text syncTime="1246.523" offset="5136310">ADM's brief, Archer Daniels Midland, page 22 of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.317" offset="5155432">Karcher, Payne, Jack, Leaf Tobacco, Guien, and Ex parte Carcroft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.782" offset="5181345">A second category of cases, this Court explained that the moving party had not actually participated in the district court proceedings, but nonetheless sought to take an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.797" offset="5221365">That explains the holding in Cutting and Connor v. Pughs Lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.881" offset="5237770">The third category of cases is where the Court has made clear or was evident from the record that the decision did not have claim-preclusive consequences on the party that sought to take an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.468" offset="5284059">That explains the holding in Bayard v. Lombard and in Marino v. Ortiz.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.252" offset="5307255">So, it is clear that in this case about 20 cases of this Court have been cited either for the general rule that only a party may appeal or for the well... well-recognized exception that quasi parties can take an appeal if those three conditions are satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.081" offset="5374547">There is not a single case cited by any of the respondents in this case that where a claim preclusion applies to someone not a formal party, that person does not have a right to appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1319.182" offset="5426896">Well, now, what is the claim preclusion here?</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.094" offset="5438599">It's... it's... it's simply that these shareholders can't bring the same derivative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.225" offset="5455108">That's all it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.117" offset="5458661">That seems to me quite different from the class judgment that binds a member to receive a certain amount in settlement of his monetary claims, et cetera.</text>

            <text syncTime="1338.197" offset="5502965">What this Court explained in Phillips Petroleum v. Shutts was that a class member in that context... also a shareholder, as it turned out, in the case... had a chosen action which was a personal property right that would be extinguished by the ultimate judgment in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.798" offset="5569420">It's no different the fact that the claim is--</text>

            <text syncTime="1356.739" offset="5577153">Well, what... what happens here is this corporation can't be sued again, and... and the right is still a derivative one in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1363.365" offset="5603693">--It's also the directors and officers who are the real defendants in this case, Justice Kennedy, cannot be sued derivatively by other shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.111" offset="5642668">And so, it's... the corporation here is a nominal defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.722" offset="5657087">In the normal shareholder derivative case, the plaintiff shareholders are bringing the action ostensibly on behalf of the corporation because directors and officers have breached their fiduciary duties or committed other misdeeds that have caused a wrong to the corporation, and so the corporation is simply a nominal defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.954" offset="5730021">But what is clear here and what the notice actually provided in the district court proceedings... and if I could refer the Court to the joint appendix, page 134 makes perfectly clear that the rights of the shareholders who are receiving this notice will have their claims forever precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.148" offset="5806821">I'm reading from the all-capped provision in the second paragraph, the second sentence which reads: If the court approves the derivative settlement, you will be barred from contesting the fairness, reasonableness or adequacy of the proposed settlement, and from pursuing the settled derivative claims.</text>

            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="1446.489" offset="5936179">Two answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.520" offset="5940255">First, Congress has made clear that in the antitrust proceedings, there is a different form of procedure for objections and for intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.334" offset="5975572">Secondly, this Court's decision in the Sam Fox case makes clear that when... that case is not cited in the briefs, but it is stated in the advisory committee notes to rule 24 of the Civil Procedure Rules, and it's a 1960 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.353" offset="6035654">But that case holds that when the Government brings an antitrust enforcement action, that does not foreclose the rights of a private party to bring a claim based on personal injury for same or similar conduct on the part of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.314" offset="6095422">So, there is a holding from this case which indicates that in the antitrust context, there is no claim preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.618" offset="6120708">And if I could just take another moment to explain that the enforcement decrees, which we have outlined in our brief, are fully suggestive that Congress could change the rules and has changed the rules in the environment, the antitrust and the civil rights contexts, but it has not changed those rules in the shareholder derivative context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.282" offset="6203360">And therefore the common law rule, which would allow persons similarly situated to the objecting shareholders in this case a right to appeal, if the district court overrules their objections, should govern here as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.752" offset="6257172">Now, I would like to address one last point that Justice Scalia raised which was some difference between why settlement would be different from litigating to judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.036" offset="6294370">And the answer, Justice Scalia, is that settlement is quite different because there is an absence of an adversarial process when the settlement is brought to the district court for approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.875" offset="6337734">And historically the courts recognized that there was a potential conflict of interest between the plaintiff shareholders who might or might not represent the views of all of the other shareholders as it turned out for settlement and the directors and officers and the nominal defendant corporation which would seek to settle the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.566" offset="6416519">And that's why the provision for court approval was put into the rule so that persons could state their objections to the adequacy of the settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.773" offset="6453299">That's very different from the adversarial process that, of course, goes when the case and the complaint go all the way through trial where the plaintiff shareholders are contending that there was some action that required jury findings and court rulings that would go all the way to judgment.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1591.595" offset="6516620">Well, what... what happens... let's... let's assume that... that you allow these shareholders to appeal and they do appeal and the settlement is set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.948" offset="6554028">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.669" offset="6556849">Then it goes back down and they come up with another settlement that is perhaps satisfactory to these shareholders, as well as to those who brought the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.696" offset="6589032">I suppose notice goes out again and yet another group of shareholders can object to the settlement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1630.280" offset="6671370">And in fact, the rule that... having objectors appeal and bring continuous and successive appeals is simply not a problem that bears any empirical evidence whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="1655.535" offset="6772307">I mean, the practical incentives for an objector are just simply not present for continuing to repeat objections that go to a settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.921" offset="6813894">But even if there was some problem like that, that certainly could be addressed by some type of an amendment to the rules if in the future there becomes some problem, and it just simply has not evidenced itself up to now.</text>

            <text syncTime="1678.379" offset="6863735">Even without the appeal, you could always have objections at the trial level and they might be sustained, and you have to send out a new notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.935" offset="6885992">And then you might have other objections and a new notice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1689.669" offset="6908875">Now, one last point I would like to make, which is that the court of appeals seemed to confuse what the proper standard for approving a settlement is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.525" offset="6940326">And if I could direct the Court's attention to page 6a of the petition appendix, the court... the court stated there that rule 23.1 provides notice to shareholders only in the event of dismissal or settlement so that other investors may contest the faithfulness or honesty of the self-appointed plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.879" offset="7021724">Our concern, from the perspective of the Federal Government's interest, is that that error gravely misstated what the standard is for approving a settlement and that if that standard is applied, it really will confuse the distinctions between rule 23.1 and 24 in a way that would make very difficult for the adequacy of settlements that are simply based on their economic terms.</text>
