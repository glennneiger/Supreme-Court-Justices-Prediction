            <text syncTime="33.092" offset="334449">In 1996, Congress enacted general standards designed to bring competition to local telecommunications markets rapidly and throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.260" offset="375200">In doing so, it expressly extended Federal law to cover the rates, terms, and conditions under which incumbents must provide new entrants access to their facilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="82.934" offset="533816">The 1996 amendments preserved the Commission's existing authority under section 201(b) to prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary in the public interest to carry out the provisions of this act.</text>

            <text syncTime="193.688" offset="976852">I don't think it does, and moreover, with respect to 201(b), it's clear that Congress in 1996 had this section specifically in mind because section 251(i) of the 1996 amendments, which is entitled Savings Provision, specifically says that nothing in this act shall be deemed to limit... nothing in section 251 shall be deemed to limit or impair the applicability of the provisions of section 201.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.636" offset="1212686">And secondly, the 1996 act itself, in any event, in section 251(d)(1) mandated the FCC within 6 months to promulgate rules, quote, as necessary to implement the requirements of this section, and that section requires incumbents to provide access to network elements at rates that are just, reasonable, and in accordance with the terms of section 252.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.486" offset="1332013">The fact that section 252 itself directs State commissions in arbitration proceedings to set the specific rates charged by a particular carrier in a particular market for a particular element is completely consistent with the FCC's authority to prescribe the general methodology by which those rates should be set.</text>

            <text syncTime="341.538" offset="1568265">First of all, section 154(i) of the act provides in a general provision that's not limited to radio or cable or anything else, similarly provides the Commission with broad rulemaking authority to implement for any provisions of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.327" offset="1635452">Second of all, section 251(d) is an express jurisdictional mandate to promulgate rules implementing the provisions of 251 which includes the requirements that rates be reasonable and in accordance with section 252.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.009" offset="1706191">And finally, if your question is directed at the operation, I guess, of section 2(b) of the act, we think that section 2(b) of the act, which is a rule of construction, is inapplicable to this case because sections 251 and 252 apply Federal law to facilities that are used interchangeably for both interstate and intrastate calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.034" offset="1806292">Just like the telephone handset that we use every day, the local telephone network is neither an intrastate or an interstate facility.</text>

            <text syncTime="422.839" offset="1893437">No, it doesn't prove too much because before the 1996 act... well, first of all, before the 1996 act, the FCC did regulate how local incumbents charge other carriers for use of their network, for example, in the cases involving exchange access or private lines or customer provided equipment.</text>

            <text syncTime="446.836" offset="1989463">All of the court of appeals' rulings upholding the jurisdiction of the FCC with respect to private lines and customer premises equipment were premised on the fact that these are used inextricably for both.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.815" offset="2041394">And since the FCC clearly has rulemaking authority with respect to the interstate component, under footnote 4 of this Court's decision in Louisiana Public Service Commission, they had authority to regulate the use of all of the uses, interstate and intrastate, of those elements because they could not be, quote, separated.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.777" offset="2129270">And, moreover, the section 2(b) does not apply to this case for two independent reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="1187.501" offset="4952167">The potential competitors have challenged the Eighth Circuit's jurisdictional ruling because the inevitable and now demonstrated effect of that ruling has been to severely undermine the prospects for rapid competition, which was the principal purpose of this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.683" offset="5024892">Because State commissions had first to determine the meaning of the Federal rate requirements before they could establish particular rates, they failed to meet the 9-month deadline for establishing rates required by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.823" offset="5089362">Moreover, there are already hundreds of Federal district court challenges to the State arbitration decisions, and the vast majority of them specifically challenge the rate methodologies employed by the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.972" offset="5145995">Until all of those challenges are finally resolved after appeals, potential competitors cannot even know how much they would have to pay for access and interconnection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1376.150" offset="5706687">Third, if it were before the Court, the TELRIC method leaves the States very substantial discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.965" offset="5733959">It allows them to determine depreciation methods, which this Court in Louisiana said was a very significant component of the ratemaking process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1696.136" offset="6986687">252 requires that all State arbitration decisions can be reviewed by Federal district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.899" offset="7009675">Federal district courts are supposed to determine whether there has been compliance with, quote, the requirements of section 251.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.185" offset="7038828">Plainly that means all of the requirements of section 251.</text>

            <text syncTime="3642.990" offset="14774103">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.942" offset="14785910">May it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.914" offset="14789776">I'm Bill Barr and I'm representing the local telephone companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.116" offset="14802629">To promote local phone competition, Congress granted a right of access to incumbent facilities, and this required drawing a line, a line through the business of the local telephone companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.024" offset="14862188">On one side of the line where no access is granted, the entrants are told here is where you can and should compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.940" offset="14893848">Here is where you put in your inputs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.291" offset="14903252">Here is where you try to become more efficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.611" offset="14912552">That's where competition is, and the more of that the merrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.934" offset="14925822">On the other side of the line, Congress says there may be areas where we can't have competition because of the legacy of monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.281" offset="14963229">Maybe it is not fair to ask you to replicate or duplicate the input of the incumbent, and so here, you may have access.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.505" offset="14996144">Now, in drawing this line, Congress set two standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.748" offset="15013071">First, it said, the only thing you can get access to are network facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.853" offset="15037522">As to everything else, we expect you to compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.365" offset="15047553">You put in your inputs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.014" offset="15054136">And even as to network facilities, you don't automatically get all of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.160" offset="15074720">We want you to compete there too the best you can, but if the FCC finds that there is part of the facility that you need, that if you fail to get it, it will impair your ability to offer service, then you can use that and get access to that part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.952" offset="15145878">Now, we're not here today because we are quibbling over the application of those standards and think the line should be drawn a little bit to one side or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.886" offset="15177643">We're here because the FCC obliterated those lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.758" offset="15197182">They did not apply either standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.129" offset="15206586">They ended up by saying that need doesn't mean need, it means technical feasibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.225" offset="15235007">Anything you can possibly get access to you must get access to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.459" offset="15259981">That's their rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.390" offset="15263638">And as to network, they say, network?</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.982" offset="15274087">No, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.573" offset="15276385">Anything that's used in the overall commercial offering of your service to the public... anything... anything that differentiates you, anything that makes you more efficient in offering to the public... is up for grabs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.212" offset="15335004">So, what does this mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.662" offset="15340751">This is the most promiscuous right of access that you can imagine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.185" offset="15362903">And to use the metaphor that you often use, Justice Breyer, about the spring and the mousetrap, they haven't take our spring.</text>

            <text syncTime="5135.026" offset="20742247">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="5139.430" offset="20759801">Because Congress has authorized the FCC to promulgate rules implementing the Communications Act, those rules must be given effect unless they are arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or manifestly contrary to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5154.590" offset="20820509">There are five substantive rules that are at issue in this portion of the case, and each one is fully consistent with the text of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5163.816" offset="20857394">The incumbents object to those rules based on their predictions about how competition will proceed if the rules were permitted to go into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5174.936" offset="20901907">But each of those objections was considered by the Commission within the mandatory 6-month period and in an atmosphere in which there was no competition to speak of in any market, and the Commission, after hearing thousands and tens of thousands of pages of comments, resolved those policy objections on the record in a manner that promotes the paramount objective of the 1996 amendments to produce vigorous competition in this country's monopoly local telephone markets as rapidly as possible by giving potential new entrants a range of competitive options.</text>
            <text syncTime="5214.019" offset="21058224">Take, for example, the two issues that, at least before this morning, appeared to be at the center of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5220.723" offset="21084973">They certainly were at the center of the briefs of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.635" offset="21096676">First, this is rule 315(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="5227.089" offset="21110469">Applying the nondiscrimination requirement of section 251(c)(3) that we talked about, the FCC promulgated a rule that prohibits incumbents from imposing completely gratuitous costs on new entrants by ripping apart network elements that are already combined in the incumbent's system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5249.993" offset="21202106">Second, the Commission declined to legislate a requirement nowhere present in the language of the statute that new entrants build one or more network elements before invoking the right to these others.</text>
            <text syncTime="5267.855" offset="21273577">The incumbents, but notably in this regard not the State commissions, argue that these rules, taken together, will undermine the current system of implicit universal service subsidies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5281.683" offset="21328852">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.704" offset="21332927">In section 254 of the act, Congress mandated an end to this monopoly based system to be replaced by a new system of explicit charges, applied equally among all carriers, regardless of the means by which they compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.038" offset="21406279">The FCC is implementing its part of the reform, and it has found on the record that the State commissions will do as well, as soon as cost based competition is introduced into their local markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="5314.905" offset="21461763">The incumbents argue that these rules would, quote, eviscerate resale as a competitive option.</text>
            <text syncTime="5323.140" offset="21494678">But the Commission found that they would not and it explained why in its order and its predictive judgments are entitled to deference.</text>

            <text syncTime="5337.142" offset="21550684">I mean, I read the section, but I missed the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="5340.722" offset="21564999">That is... maybe I'll say what... the part that's bothering me, and I think the reason they've gotten to this is, if I saw this act as having two parts, the first part is that the BOC's are supposed to bring competition to long distance, that they can't do that because the others said we're not going to let you compete with us unless you let us compete with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="5360.666" offset="21644829">But the difficulty, as you put in your brief very well, you say on page 4 of your brief... you explained it beautifully... that there are large elements of this that are naturally monopolistic, loops, et cetera, and no one knows where they break off.</text>
            <text syncTime="5375.477" offset="21703971">So, their complaint is that what happened with this rule is it says, Steve Breyer or you or anybody else in the world could go to Bell Atlantic and say, sell us your whole system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5387.684" offset="21752872">Now, why would someone do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="5389.654" offset="21760709">Because for years and years Bell Atlantic has had to charge high prices to business customers, for example, because, one, the universal service, but also because of allocation rules on their fixed costs which shove a lot of the fixed costs onto business people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5405.684" offset="21824865">So, you or I can make a fortune by buying up their system, and using this TELRIC system, which... by the way, the best criticism of which comes from Holmes and Brandeis in Missouri v. Southwestern Bell.</text>
            <text syncTime="5418.103" offset="21874498">But regardless of that, isn't what they say factually true?</text>
            <text syncTime="5423.048" offset="21894351">And if that's factually true, how could that be consistent with a statute which is designed to allow new competition in some but not all elements, indeed, not in the elements that you state on page 4?</text>
            <text syncTime="5438.966" offset="21957985">Now, that's my one question, but it's fairly long and fairly basic.</text>

I understand the question to be why isn't there fear that new incumbents will use the opportunity to lease all elements to, in effect, make an end run around the resale option that the statute permits under (c)(4) which is priced as a discount to retail rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="5479.304" offset="22119318">The assertion that allowing new entrants to lease all network elements would obliterate resale as a competitive option is both empirically wrong, as the Commission found on the record... and I will point you to the provisions... but it is also... and before I get to it, I think it fundamentally misconceives the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5502.828" offset="22213463">There is no textual basis in the statute for preferring one mode of competition or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="5508.952" offset="22237914">The FCC found... and I think it's correct in this regard... that Congress, in passing this statute, in effect, acted in the role of Aristotle's prime mover.</text>
            <text syncTime="5519.779" offset="22281277">It set... it created a set of options for private choice to ensure that something would work to bring competition in each disparate local market whether it's rural residential or downtown Manhattan, and like natural selection, what matters is not that every variation survives for every possible competitive strategy, but that at least one works in each environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5548.119" offset="22394544">So, I disagree with the... and the FCC disagreed with the premise of their understanding of the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="5602.285" offset="22611256">Now, with respect to the empirical findings that the Commission made... and recall, Justice Breyer, that these were findings that had to be made within 6 months by mandate in a period in which there is no competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5616.033" offset="22666217">Someone's predictive judgment is going to have to be given weight, either the FCC's, which for 65 years has been regulating this industry, or local... or local incumbents who have never experienced and certainly have not embraced cost based competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5633.126" offset="22734658">What the FCC found... and I would direct you to paragraphs 331 through 334 of the First Report and Order principally, although there are some other subsidiary references... is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="5650.166" offset="22802785">First, that resale allows quicker entry because you don't have to go through this detailed, bottoms up costing determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5658.293" offset="22835282">It provides, unlike leasing network elements, a guaranteed return.</text>
            <text syncTime="5664.067" offset="22858374">You know what you are going to be making when you resell and you know what your costs will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="5669.390" offset="22879690">It also is better, Justice Breyer, for an entrant that only wants to offer a narrow range of services or an entrant that has little up front capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="5680.306" offset="22923367">I mean, this act was not enacted to protect AT&amp;T or Bell Atlantic or any other giant that may be able to compete on its own terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="5689.793" offset="22961296">The purpose of this act was to allow vigorous competition even by little guys a la what happened when long distance services were deregulated because AT&amp;T at the time had to give access to its elements at the best rate it offered to anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="5708.577" offset="23036425">And moreover, even in the short term period before State universal service is reformed from a monopoly implicit subsidy situation to what Congress has mandated, explicit subsidies that apply to and are charged against all entrants, even entrants that are competing on the basis of network elements, during that period rural customers can only receive competition through resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="5737.184" offset="23150841">And in general, residential customers who don't make long distance calls will be serviced through the (c)(4) mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="5745.379" offset="23183651">The Commission also found... I think it's paragraph 334... that just as resale has certain advantages and disadvantages with respect to leasing elements, leasing elements has greater risks and operational costs for all potential competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5766.172" offset="23266825">First of all, there are fixed costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5769.895" offset="23281662">Some network elements, like the loop, like the network interface device, like certain sub elements within the switch, are leased on a flat rate per month basis, and those costs have to be paid whether you get enough revenues from the customer or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5787.747" offset="23353133">And in many instances... and they're documented I think in AT&amp;T's reply brief... the... the fixed costs for leasing the loop alone, which is only one of the seven elements, is greater than the retail charge that the incumbent is making for that service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5806.240" offset="23427112">In addition, TELRIC and other pricing mechanisms allow incumbents to charge... make nonrecurring charges like one time provisioning and installation charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="5818.566" offset="23476327">That's money that you pay on the barrel head whether you want to get out quickly or not and whether your customer ends up generating enough revenue to satisfy you or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5828.133" offset="23514674">Even as to usage sensitive rates, there are risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="5833.295" offset="23535259">You can say, well, you know, you only pay for so much of the switch as you use.</text>
            <text syncTime="5837.659" offset="23552709">That's true, but you have to be able to collect it from your customer, and if you have a customer, for example, who doesn't make any long distance calls, all he does is call his Internet service provider and he spends 5 hours a day surfing the web, you will end up having to... if you resell, you don't have any risks, but if you lease the switch as a network element, you will have very significant usage costs and yet will only be able to--</text>

I mean, it's conceivable I grant you, but when looking through those three paragraphs, if that's what the FCC is driving at, I think they'd have to use some example that's a little better than just announcing that there is some risk that the loop won't be paid for.</text>

            <text syncTime="6219.051" offset="25078364">Now, there is no question in this case that the Commission applied dictionary definitions for those words, and there is no question in the First Report and Order that it considered both need and impair not only in general in the section that addresses this standard, but as to each of the seven network elements that it identified, loops, switches, trunks, NID's, signaling.</text>
            <text syncTime="6246.590" offset="25188496">It has a section with respect to each one that applies the need and impairment standard and states the reasons why it thinks that it was met.</text>
            <text syncTime="6256.206" offset="25226949">Again, this is an order that was required to be produced within 6 months, a time when there was no competition, a time in which all of the incumbents are monopolists and the Commission determined, again making specific references to the fact that it may change its requirements as conditions develop... it expressly said for present purposes in this environment where there's no competition, we're only going to look within the incumbent monopolist's own network.</text>
            <text syncTime="6286.865" offset="25349620">And that is a reasonable requirement in a monopoly regime.</text>

            <text syncTime="6306.430" offset="25427883">Mr. Barr made two principal arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="6308.940" offset="25437914">He objects to the fact that new entrants can obtain all elements, and he objects to the application of the need standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="6314.006" offset="25458185">The implication and necessary consequence of his arguments, if accepted, would mean that there would be no price constraints whatsoever on the incumbent local monopolies in any area of the country until some local facility were constructed by ATT or anyone else who had the resources to do so, and even in those areas, the only constraint would be that that ATT would provide... you have a duopoly rather than a monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6341.021" offset="25566227">And that position follows from the fact that the only option people could use is resale, and when you use resale, you can only offer one of the two services that any local exchange network offers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6354.051" offset="25618367">You could only offer exchange service and you could only offer it on terms that don't affect the margins that the local monopolists run at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="6387.704" offset="25752950">What Mr. Barr wants is a rule of the FCC that means that when these States conduct arbitrations, when any individual requesting carrier asks for something, you litigate whether, for that requesting carrier, it has options.</text>
            <text syncTime="6403.074" offset="25814390">There's lots of people who concededly under even his view, the non ATT's of this world, can't build... can't construct alternative facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6410.948" offset="25845946">So, he wants to tie up these... these arbitration proceedings with case by case, area by area litigation of whether particular entrants can acquire particular facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6421.424" offset="25887847">The FCC said that that was pointless.</text>
            <text syncTime="6424.028" offset="25898191">When it was applying the standards of 252(d), it said need means added cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="6651.376" offset="26807566">--Yes, and that relates to my second point.</text>
            <text syncTime="6653.629" offset="26816656">The point is that when you obtain elements, even if you obtain all the elements, you... you are... you are investing in the network in much the same way that an owner would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="6665.206" offset="26862945">Justice Breyer, if you look at the Commission's TELRIC rules, paragraphs 686 to 687, you will see that all the investment risks that a new entrant... you know, that a new entrant has to... has to take on all the investment risks of the... of the carrier to the extent the new entrant is leasing the carrier's facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6688.061" offset="26954374">So, the new entrant is fundamentally a lessee that is much in the position of an owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="6694.455" offset="26979974">And in response to you, Justice Ginsburg, when the... when the FCC found that only people who engaged in resale under (c)(4) were prohibited from jointly... jointly marketing long distance services, it was on the basis that it only covered resale, didn't prohibit owners of facilities, and that lessees of network elements had investments like those of owners, not like those of resellers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6719.480" offset="27080075">And the difference between resale and... and leasing network elements is absolutely fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="6725.624" offset="27104630">When you... when you're a reseller under (c)(4), you're just buying the same services that each of us use in our homes, the same services.</text>
            <text syncTime="6733.502" offset="27136082">When you're... it's... local telephone networks are plants that provide two things: exchange services we each buy, exchange access services that inter exchange carriers buy and that account for 35 percent of the revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="6745.490" offset="27184043">When you resell... when you resell, you only get to resell what we use in our homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6751.073" offset="27206403">When you lease elements, you're paying for the whole... whole ball of wax, everything that's there, covering all the investment risks, and you're in a position to provide all the services that the LEC is currently providing and impose price constraints that otherwise won't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="6769.634" offset="27280696">And this will have no effect on the incentives of people to build new facilities because even if you lease all these things at precisely their economic cost, you're going to have higher costs than they do because of the enormous transaction costs of... of depending on a monopoly competitor to try to get what you need to compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="6788.817" offset="27357391">The FCC found throughout this order that they have incentives to slow roll us in negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6793.569" offset="27376408">They have the incentive and ability to discriminate against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="6796.852" offset="27389469">We... no one in their right mind would rely on these people for... for facilities if they could obtain... could... could obtain them from another source themselves at anything remotely approaching the sum of the costs if you lease all the elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="6811.521" offset="27448193">So... so, this is as fundamental difference as one can imagine.</text>
            <text syncTime="6816.286" offset="27467210">Now, Mr.... Mr. Barr talks about the specific definition of operator support systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="6822.260" offset="27491138">I think the text of the first sentence forecloses this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6825.540" offset="27504304">The text of the second sentence establishes that the... this is not something that's limited to routing and transmission.</text>
            <text syncTime="6832.796" offset="27533247">But I just want to point out that a separate regulation that no one has ever challenged... 313(d) I think it is... independently requires the same access to operations for systems based on a finding that if you don't have the information that those systems provide, you're in a position where you never can get access to the six other elements that are not being challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="6856.361" offset="27627602">He also complains about the fact that the... this rule supposedly give access to live operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="6861.015" offset="27646201">They don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="6861.644" offset="27648709">The specific regulation says the access to operator facilities and all the functions they provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="6868.139" offset="27674622">We get the access to those functions irrespective of whether those functions are performed by humans or by machines, as most operator functions are, by the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6878.045" offset="27714328">And every single element in this network to some extent relies on humans.</text>

            <label>Mr. William P. Barr</label>
            <text syncTime="6888.614" offset="27756542">There's a pivotal word in section 251(c)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="6893.887" offset="27777649">It's the word on an unbundled basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6897.290" offset="27791233">What does that mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="6897.738" offset="27793114">If I have a statute that says... we say it means unbundled from the whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="6903.582" offset="27816415">So, it means less than the whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="6905.745" offset="27825087">That's what you're taking under that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6907.835" offset="27833447">If I have a statute that says to promote automobile manufacturers and it says you can buy GM's car and resell it if you want, or to make your own car, you can get parts from General Motors on an unbundled basis, to suggest that I can put an order in to General Motors saying please give me all the constituent parts of a car on a preassembled basis so I get the same output unit a car, and if that's the purpose of the provision, it's ludicrous.</text>
            <text syncTime="6936.464" offset="27947967">What unbundled means in every context I'm aware of is disaggregating the stuff you're taking from the whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="6944.040" offset="27978269">And this is why it relates back to the need inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="6947.573" offset="27992376">What the FCC was supposed to do was say, what do they need, what don't they need.</text>
            <text syncTime="6952.124" offset="28010661">And the stuff they don't need from the incumbent they provide themselves, and in order to induce them to put that into the marketplace so you have competition at least on those parts, we have an unbundling provision that lets them get the rest unbundled from the whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="6966.894" offset="28069698">So, our argument is that that provision simply is not available to go in and engage in a fiction that you're getting anything on an unbundled basis when you buy our entire network from stem to stern.</text>

            <text syncTime="6982.415" offset="28131765">So, the Solicitor General says, look, this isn't perfect.</text>

            <text syncTime="6990.138" offset="28162694">--if you... if you... if you have to rely on everything that the incumbent has, that's why resale is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6996.133" offset="28186622">Resale is there to build scale so you can deploy facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="7000.156" offset="28202714">The second point I want to make about 251(c)(3) is this notion that there's something different is bogus.</text>
            <text syncTime="7006.231" offset="28227060">There's no different risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="7007.513" offset="28232180">And more importantly, because you pay by the line, by the month, just as you would if you bought it resale and you only pay for what you actually use on capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="7016.479" offset="28268020">But the more important point is the opportunities they talk about.</text>
            <text syncTime="7020.680" offset="28284843">They say, oh, we have all these opportunities if we do it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="7023.340" offset="28295501">Please focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="7024.602" offset="28300516">Those opportunities are restatements of the evasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="7028.356" offset="28315563">They say, under resale we can't joint market, but if we do it this way, we have the additional opportunity of selling long distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="7035.890" offset="28345656">Under resale, we can't provide access, but if we do it this way, we can sell access as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="7043.186" offset="28374808">There's no new input by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="7045.557" offset="28384317">There is merely evasion of the restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="7047.318" offset="28391422">They have taken the position that it's meant to induce them to bring inputs into the marketplace, partial inputs which otherwise couldn't be deployed unless they could fill in the gaps with the unbundling provision, and converted it into nothing more than another label for resale without the restrictions.</text>

I would like someone to tell that to the Chairman of AT&amp;T because they have been standing around with their hands in their pockets for 3 years talking about a UNE platform, that their entry strategy was to buy a UNE platform, which means our network, nothing different, totally our network under the fiction that they're buying pieces.</text>

            <text syncTime="7099.904" offset="28601760">Facilities, TCI and... and a teleport.</text>
            <text syncTime="7104.038" offset="28618269">So, they're now introducing facilities into the marketplace because the scam of taking a free ride on our network and using the arbitrage... the person that is hurt by arbitrage is Aunt Tilly because the money that the business people are paying was supposed to support her service.</text>
            <text syncTime="7119.616" offset="28680545">What the FCC rule does is it takes that money and diverts into the... uses it as a subsidy for people to come in and provide Potemkin competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="7128.602" offset="28716490">I'm reselling the same network as these guys, and I'm taking the money that was supporting Aunt Tilly and putting it in my pocket.</text>
