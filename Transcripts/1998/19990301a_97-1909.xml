            <text syncTime="86.658" offset="490668">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="92.391" offset="513551">The issue in this case is whether the 30-day time period for removal begins to run when a named defendant receives a copy of the complaint if service of process has not yet been perfected.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.398" offset="561616">28 U.S.C. section 1446(b) requires that notice of removal be filed within 30 days after the receipt by the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.988" offset="611980">Relying upon the plain meaning of the words, receipt through service or otherwise, the Eleventh Circuit held that the removal period commences when a named party comes into possession of a copy of the complaint, even if service has not been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.789" offset="675197">We submit to the Court that, when read as a whole and in conjunction with the other removal statutes, section 1446(b) is ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.516" offset="714067">The ambiguity arises from the use of the term, defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.067" offset="732248">A defendant can mean either a named party, a party who is named as the defendant in the complaint, or it can mean, in more proper sense, one who has been made a party defendant through service of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.445" offset="785851">In section 1441(b), Congress used the term defendant in the narrower sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.681" offset="814795">1441(b) states that parties in interest... or uses the phrase, parties in interest who have been properly joined and served as defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.208" offset="972888">I think it is... I don't think it is... was intended as a definitional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.450" offset="997861">I think it is a demonstration that Congress was using the term there in a narrow sense, and suggests that perhaps Congress was using that term in a narrow sense in section 1446(b) as well.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="227.881" offset="1055539">I don't see why it's being used in a narrow sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.221" offset="1060868">It would have been used in a narrow sense if 1441(b) had just said, persons who are defendants, and the very word defendants would embrace the terms, have been properly joined and served.</text>

            <text syncTime="243.362" offset="1117502">It didn't... Congress didn't think that the word defendant automatically embraced those terms, and therefore it said, who... people who have been joined and served as defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.660" offset="1162642">I'm not sure that it helps your case more than hurts it.</text>

            <text syncTime="262.256" offset="1193048">I think it does help, because I think it demonstrates that Congress felt a need to articulate in what sense it was using the term, defendant, in recognition that a defendant as... in common usage a defendant can mean, anybody who is named as a defendant in a complaint, and doesn't necessarily infer only a defendant who has been properly joined.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="288.224" offset="1296911">But your argument has to be based on the proposition that Congress was using the term, defendant, in 1441(b) in the same way it was using it in 1446(b).</text>

          <turn speaker="deborah_a_smith" startTime="302.376" stopTime="322.889">
            <label>Ms. Deborah A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="302.376" offset="1353544">Well, our argument is that it suggests, by the use of the term defendant in 1441(b), it suggests that Congress was using the narrow term defendant in 1446(b) as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.587" offset="1422403">I think it demonstrates the ambiguity in the term.</text>

            <label>Ms. Deborah A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="331.734" offset="1470991">Well, in 1441(b) we're dealing with more than just parties who are named as defendants, because we're talking about parties in interest, and that could possibly be someone other than someone who has actually been named as a defendant in the complaint.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="348.205" offset="1536819">Even if I... I'm not sure I agree with you, I think for the same reason that Justice Scalia's question suggested, but assuming that I do agree with you for the sake of argument, I still have a serious problem with your position, and it's because of the usage of defendant in 1448.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.467" offset="1609858">1448 clearly contemplates that some individuals who are defendants in a case that has been removed may not yet have been served, and therefore, in 1448, it seems clearly to be using defendant in the sense of somebody who is simply called that in the pleadings, whether or not served, and that's the sticking point that I have.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.354" offset="1717482">How do you explain how I could accept your position for 1446, given the language of 1448?</text>

            <text syncTime="401.679" offset="1750710">I think in 1448 Congress was using the term in the broader sense, in recognition that there would be cases where a case had been removed and either the defendant who removed it had not been properly served, or where there were other defendants--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="430.599" offset="1866380">Well, assuming that is the case, doesn't it also demonstrate that in 1446 Congress could not have been using defendant in the narrow sense, i.e., that which... sense that requires service, as part of the meaning of the term?</text>

            <text syncTime="448.631" offset="1938583">I don't think so, because even if we assume that a defendant can only remove, that there couldn't be an early removal by a defendant who received a copy of the complaint, decided to go ahead and remove it even though his time had not begun to run under a service interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.253" offset="2013084">Aside... taking that instance aside, there are cases where a defendant's time begins to run because he has been served with process, and there are other defendants in the suit that haven't been served, so 1448 deals with those other defendants who have not been served.</text>
