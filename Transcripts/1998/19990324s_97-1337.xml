            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="85708">The opinion of the Court in No. 97-1337, Minnesota versus Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians will be announced by Justice O'Connor.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="9.141" offset="122175">This case comes here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.483" offset="143595">In 1837, several bands of Chippewa Indians entered into a treaty with the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.067" offset="169927">Through the treaty the Chippewa sold land in present day Minnesota and Wisconsin to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.435" offset="195422">The United States guaranteed to the Chippewa the right to hunt, fish, and gather on the ceded land during the pleasure of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.959" offset="233457">In 1990, the Chippewa filed suit against the State of Minnesota claiming that they retain this Treaty right today.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.276" offset="266789">The District Court agreed with the Chippewa and the Eighth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.485" offset="283612">In an opinion filed with the Clerk at the Court today, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.514" offset="307749">The state argues that the Chippewa's Treaty rights were terminated by any one of three events.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.397" offset="331259">First, the state argues that the Treaty privileges were terminated by President Zachary Taylor in 1850.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.485" offset="359576">In that year President Taylor issued an Executive Order directing that the Chippewa be removed from the ceded lands and revoking their treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather on the ceded lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.385" offset="411194">This Court has previously held that a President's power to issue an Executive Order must come either from an active Congress or from the Constitution, but the State has pointed to "no statute or constitutional provision authorizing the President's order removing the Chippewa from the ceded lands".</text>
            <text syncTime="100.308" offset="486844">Because the President had no authority to issue the removal order, that portion of the order was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.270" offset="514743">The only question remaining is whether the other part of the order, the part revoking the Chippewa Treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather on the land is severable from the part that is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.280" offset="566779">We conclude after an examination of the historical record that the 1850 Executive Order was meant to stand or fall as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.892" offset="609202">Because the removal order was invalid and because the removal order and the revocation of the Treaty rights were inseverable, the 1850 order in its entirety was invalid, and did not terminate the Chippewa Treaty rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.095" offset="670015">A president now or in the future may be able to revoke the Chippewa Treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather in accordance with the terms of the Treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.413" offset="711288">What we hold today is simply that the 1850 Executive Order did not accomplish that objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.486" offset="743576">The state next argues that the Chippewa Treaty rights were terminated by an 1855 Treaty between certain Chippewa bands and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.214" offset="782550">The 1855 Treaty, however, did not mention the 1837 Treaty, and did not mention the termination of any previously granted Treaty rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.926" offset="821316">The historical context surrounding the later Treaty demonstrates that it was designed to have the United States purchase additional Chippewa land and not to terminate the hunting, fishing, and gathering rights granted in the earlier Treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.860" offset="885055">Finally, the state contends that the Chippewa's hunting, fishing, and gathering rights were terminated when Minnesota was admitted to the Union in 1858.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.594" offset="924030">When new states are admitted to the Union they are admitted on equal footing with the original 13 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.229" offset="950570">In other words, they are admitted with the same attributes of State sovereignty enjoyed by the original 13 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.479" offset="979618">In a case decided in 1896, Ward versus Race Horse, this Court held that certain Indian Treaty rights were terminated when Wyoming was admitted to the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.027" offset="1025803">The Race Horse Court held that because the Treaty rights in that case where temporary and precarious, it was clear that the Congress intended those Treaty rights to terminate upon statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.805" offset="1072928">But there is no evidence in this case of Congressional intent for the Chippewa Treaty rights to terminate when Minnesota entered the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.395" offset="1103230">Moreover, subsequent decisions of this Court have qualified the Race Horse Court's holding that Indian Treaty rights are automatically terminated on statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.006" offset="1141682">Indian Treaty rights can coexist with state management of natural resources, and in fact the states retain the power to regulate the exercise of Indian Treaty rights when necessary for the conservation of wildlife.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.759" offset="1200719">The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas have joined; Justice Thomas has filed a separate dissenting opinion.</text>
