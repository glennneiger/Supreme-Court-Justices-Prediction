            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="146888">We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 97-1704, Esteban Ortiz v. The Fibreboard Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.807" offset="186072">Mr. Tribe.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="11.109" stopTime="190.218">
            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="11.109" offset="191296">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.765" offset="213866">The Fifth Circuit does not deny that this class is just as noncohesive and riven with conflict as the one in Amchem, and it even admits, in its words, that a class action... I'm reading from footnote 8 of the opinion... class action requesting individual damages for a global class of asbestos claimants would not satisfy the typicality requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.831" offset="310206">Now, since that is this case, the first mystery, I think, to be addressed is how the Fifth Circuit and the respondents imagine that they can get past Rule 23(a) here.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.826" offset="350121">I think a fair version of their answer is that one should focus on how the settlements would operate and not on what the complaints sought, and if you do that, you're told you will see that the settlement in Amchem would have ended up, in their words, awarding damages to class members based on the severity of their injuries, while this settlement, according to them, just sets up an equitable distribution process that leaves intact each claimants, and I now quote them again, absolute right to exit into the tort system to litigate his claims in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.319" offset="492122">Now, that answer is fallacious from top to bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.712" offset="505706">Amchem held, among other things, that one cannot rely entirely on the operation of the settlement to dissolve divisions that preclude class certification, and their description, both of the settlement in Amchem and of the settlement in this case, are flatly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.724" offset="569758">The Amchem settlement, as this Court noted, did not preordain the amounts to be awarded to each claimant, just as this settlement doesn't, and this settlement certainly does not simply add a fund from which damages can be paid to plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.701" offset="629631">It does not preserve the absolute right to exit, as I'll explain in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.405" offset="656485">It extinguishes individual rights to sue and substitutes access to a trust distribution process rather akin to Worker's Compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.981" offset="690757">The reason I say that it does not preserve a right to exit is that first of all no exit is possible till one has exhausted mediation, arbitration, and other ADR mechanisms, and even then the plaintiff who does exit remains subject to all of the settlement's strict limits, [$] 1/2 million as a cap on compensatory damages, no punitive damages, no prejudgment interest, no post judgment interest, no joint and several liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.900" offset="802457">And finally, anyone who does exit is penalized for exercising the right recognized I guess most recently in Wright v. Universal Maritime Service Corporation, right of going to court, penalized because payments can then be deferred for up to 10 years without interest as compared with 3 years if someone opts not to exit and remains within the trust system.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.607" offset="905275">Now--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="190.218" offset="907678">Mr. Tribe, I thought that the Fifth Circuit on remand said the big difference was that Amchem was certified under (b)(3), and this was a nonopt-out (b)(1)(B).</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="201.965" stopTime="243.876">
            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="201.965" offset="954699">--Yes, Justice Ginsburg, they certainly did, and what I would like to show in a moment is that, if that's the difference, it cuts very much against class certification here.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.332" offset="992210">It cuts against class certification partly because, as I'll try to show, it's impossible to squeeze this into that category of a mandatory class, but in any event, that can't solve the problems under (a), the problems of cohesion and of the absence of conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.694" offset="1065562">And in particular, if you focus on the absence of conflict, what's crucial to note is that the equitable distribution process in this case embodies allocational decisions, decisions to limit damage payments from the trust.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="243.876" stopTime="253.430">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="243.876" offset="1122300">Well, Mr. Tribe, you talk about how badly these people are going to fare under the... but how well are they going to fare if they just keep fighting their individual lawsuits?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="253.430" stopTime="265.598">
            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="253.430" offset="1160544">Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not talking about how good or bad in terms of ultimate fairness the settlement is, only the question of whether it was proper to certify it in the first instance.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="265.598" stopTime="280.207">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="265.598" offset="1209236">Well, but you pointed out that the people are left... even when they finally go to court it's a cap on damages and that sort of thing, but don't you have to compare that with what their fate would be if they simply keep suing Fiberboard and it ends up in bankruptcy?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="280.207" stopTime="344.963">
            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="280.207" offset="1267646">Well, Mr. Chief Justice, if we were talking about whether it's a good settlement, if that's the reason I was mentioning the caps, I guess we would.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.803" offset="1294081">I'm mentioning them only to make clear that as in Amchem this is not simply a favor that they are doing to the people who have been victimized by asbestos.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.831" offset="1342147">It is a substitution of their old rights with a set of equitable rights, and it's a substitution that makes some allocational decisions with respect to which there's a deep division, a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.778" offset="1385928">Those who are presently injured have, as in Amchem, an interest in maximizing payments early.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.701" offset="1409647">Those who are merely exposed have an interest in preserving money for the future, and there was no attempt to create subclasses here.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.018" offset="1446950">If subclasses with separate representation had been created, no one can really guess exactly how the ultimate settlement would look.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.353" offset="1476207">There's no reason to suppose that it couldn't have been done, and no reason, therefore, to suppose that the only alternative is an endless stream of individual lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.889" offset="1510375">In fact, 99 percent of asbestos litigation settles in any event.</text>

            <text syncTime="1655.167" offset="6767466">But if we go back to when Rule 23 was on the books and we go back to the '66 amendments, which is when all this came in, nobody had even the wildest dream that you could bring a mass tort action even under (b)(3), no less (b)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.349" offset="6836220">And then Kaplan was very clear to calm the people who were worried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.200" offset="6855655">He said, no, you can't use this statute that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.305" offset="6872060">This thing is, he said, "redolent of a preexisting fund".</text>

            <text syncTime="1815.625" offset="7409347">But all of those coverage cases did not really plead yet, did not really bring the last issue before any court, which some class member would sooner or later bring when it brought a judgment, as Justice Scalia says, to the insurer, of whether or not the conduct engaged in by Fibreboard vitiated the coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.745" offset="7485833">Sooner or later, sooner or later, one or another of these cases would have decided all of these insurance coverage issues, and if the class members weren't there they would have been at some risk that as a practical matter, as the rule says, the issues would be decided, they would not be able to protect their interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="2172.555" offset="8837095">But if it were decided against them and that decision ultimately were decided by the Supreme Court of California, the rest of these tort victims, while they might still have retained their entitlement to bring these individual tort cases in the system, would have had a futile act to bring.</text>

            <text syncTime="3037.901" offset="12298424">No, not necessarily, because there was still a very important question that the insurance companies raise about whether Fibreboard's practice of settling cases with plaintiffs, billions of dollars worth of settlements with plaintiffs, on an assignment basis under the policy was in breach of the policy, which an intermediate court in California, incidentally, after the settlement was reached, held that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.518" offset="12388912">What were the consequences of that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.567" offset="12397063">The insurer would argue next that vitiated the very coverage that the Court of Appeals approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.572" offset="12421095">And those issues were yet to be litigated and were percolating along, and if all of these insurance issues had not been resolved in this unitary way sooner or later they would have been resolved in one case or another on a litigated basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.811" offset="12478042">An that litigated basis, as the testimony showed in the district court, put these people at an enormous risk that it would be resolved against them in some substantive way and the result then would have been that, yes, they would have had their individual tort claims, but they never would have been able to recover any damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.484" offset="12552752">In my remaining minutes, let me talk just a bit about the common law, because Professor Tribe suggests that under the old cases you had to have an in rem, a res of some kind, and that is not what those cases stand for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.860" offset="12654317">If you go back and look at cases like Lee against Thomas in 1751, Chancey against May in 1722, where there was a Bill of Peace, a representative Bill of Peace to recover for embezzlement damages, the Adair case, whether a rent charge on the profits would bear an assessment or would not bear an assessment, these were not cases where the litigants were seeking an interest in a res or in a common property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.120" offset="12767270">What developed in equity was not just related to equitable claims, but people came to the court in equity and said: We have all of these cases, some of them may be at law, some of them may be in equity, but we don't need to proliferate all of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.989" offset="12830800">We're being buried by them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3276.828" offset="13254192">They were really like permissive joinders and they don't provide any precedent for what's happening here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.532" offset="13273001">I think if you ask what is happening here, it's most dramatically put in a question that I think both in one way or another Justice Ginsburg and Justice O'Connor were asking, and that is just take the ordinary garden variety tort claim by somebody who in fact has been injured, not just exposed but is experiencing injury, who didn't happen to file by the magic turn into a pumpkin date of August 27, 1993.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.996" offset="13362862">By what alchemy is it, by what edict of Congress, or by what inherent judicial authority without Congress, is it that that ordinary claim gets transmuted into not a first come, first served right to be paid, but some intangible chunk of a fund whose limits are established from the defense side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.561" offset="13457112">I mean, I don't think there has really been an answer to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.354" offset="13468292">This is not, after all, a case where, for example, the insurance policies have relevant ceilings on coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.400" offset="13492429">Here the aggregate is unlimited, which is why there was no limit to the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.435" offset="13512596">But if there were a ceiling on coverage of the relevant policy, I can imagine that creating a preexisting limited fund, so that under (b)(1)(B) you might have direct claims against the insurance company, but it wouldn't discharge the defendant.</text>
