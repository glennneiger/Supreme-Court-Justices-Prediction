            <text syncTime="8.668" offset="187585">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.340" offset="198348">This case is here from the Third Circuit which held that the NCAA would be covered by title IX if it received dues from member institutions which receive Federal financial assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.866" offset="244428">That decision is wrong and should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.049" offset="257175">It's wrong because Court has held that for an entity to be covered by title IX, or any of the other statutes with the same Federal funding trigger, the entity must itself be a recipient of Federal financial assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.777" offset="312032">The Court said just that in the Paralyzed Veterans case.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.260" offset="326034">Quote, Congress limited the scope of the law to those who actually receive Federal financial assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.090" offset="393326">End quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.495" offset="393221">Later in the same opinion, the Court said that these laws, quoting again, require us to identify the recipient of the Federal assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.751" offset="395938">And it also explained why that is so.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="63.563" offset="407223">But we've also said that it can be... it can indirectly be a recipient.</text>

            <text syncTime="69.076" offset="429270">In the Grove City case, Your Honor, but the test is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.158" offset="441600">Whether a direct recipient or an indirect recipient, the entity must be the intended recipient under the grant statute or program.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.035" offset="473051">And the reason for that is clear, the condition... the prohibition on discrimination is imposed as a condition on the receipt of funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.021" offset="508996">So, it is limited to those who accept the funds and thereby agree to the condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.703" offset="527804">That is consistent with the Court's decision last term in Gebser which reaffirmed that construction and the rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.507" offset="554971">The discriminatory acts of the school employee in that case did not automatically trigger a damage action under title IX because title IX's coverage is limited to recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.444" offset="598752">The recipient was the school district, not the employee, and therefore the question was what did the school district know and what did the school district do or not do.</text>

            <text syncTime="146.338" offset="738351">And the regulation doesn't say, as the Third Circuit thought, that it was enough that you operate an educational program or activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1568.143" offset="6425521">The complaint was immediately dismissed on the grounds that the NCAA is in some sense not subject to title IX or at least not on the basis of the allegations in that complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.078" offset="6457286">And she amended her complaint, and in the amended complaint, she alleges quite plainly at paragraph 65, which since the amended complaint was only added to the record afterwards, it's unfortunately not in the joint appendix, but it has been lodged, the NCAA is a recipient of Federal funds because it is an entity which receives Federal financial assistance through another recipient and operates an educational program or activity which receives or benefits from such assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.184" offset="6553730">And it seems quite plain to me that if you give any kind of a liberal interpretation to the pleadings of a pro se litigant in the context of that case, that that allegation has raised a whole slew of theories as to why the NCAA ought to be regarded at a minimum as a recipient, either direct or indirect.</text>

            <text syncTime="2688.468" offset="10906775">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.928" offset="10964663">The Third Circuit decided this case, at least as petitioner understands it, on a theory that someone in the position of the NCAA can be subject to suit under title IX solely on the ground that it is a mere beneficiary of the program and on that ground alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.589" offset="11031327">We agree with petitioner that that reading... if that is what the Third Circuit meant to hold, that that is incorrect, and that that is inconsistent with the decision in Paralyzed Veterans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.308" offset="11078139">All that this Court needs to decide is that that particular theory was incorrect and it could remand for consideration of alternative theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.054" offset="11113143">For example, the petition in this case presents the question on the assumption that petitioner is not a recipient, but is... does its receipt of payments... does the receipt of payments by a non-recipient essentially on the benefit theory subject it to liability?</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.712" offset="11175837">The question... the question of, however, of whether the NCAA is a recipient, either because the colleges operate programs and pay dues which pass on some of the Federal financial assistance, or alternatively, because of the Health and Human Services grant that is... that is made to the National Youth Sports Program, operated and administered according to the NCAA's own constitution by a committee of the NCAA, whether either of those theories of being a recipient subjects it to coverage is not, I think, within the question presented and could properly be considered on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.495" offset="11302896">The other question of whether the NCAA is subject to suit under title IX, because it has been ceded controlling authority over the operation of the program in certain particulars, was I think fairly raised in the court of appeals on pages 5, 9, and 22 of the respondent's brief, but that too was not addressed by the court of appeals and could be considered on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.648" offset="11391503">I think it's important, though, in leaving these questions open for the court of appeals, for this Court not to rule out the possibility or not to foreclose as a matter of law any of these various theories because this case is at a very preliminary stage, and the court... the district court--</text>

            <text syncTime="3290.129" offset="13313489">First, I'd like to agree with both of my brothers that the Third Circuit decision was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.603" offset="13331357">It was wrong because title IX, as Spending Clause legislation, is limited to recipients, and the effort to rely on the dues or some surrogate relationship severs title IX from its rooting in the Spending Clause and the limitation to recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.774" offset="13400006">The argument that was raised that the statutory language doesn't carry any such limitation was the precise argument that was raised last term in Gebser, and it was rejected in Gebser.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.721" offset="13447863">If it's enough to be subject to discrimination under a program, the student in Gebser certainly was, but that was not enough because title IX is limited to recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.067" offset="13485166">And so, the question is what does a recipient know about what was going on and what did the recipient do or not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.302" offset="13510139">Now, so far as the new alternative arguments are made, it is important to recognize that... that in our view they have not been properly preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.888" offset="13548486">The NYSP argument, for example, was not mentioned before the district court by the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.771" offset="13568026">The court said, assuming your complaint is amended--</text>

            <text syncTime="3358.474" offset="13586834">But, Mr. Roberts, given the pro se litigant, given the large discretion that the district judge has on complaint amendments, should we be the one to decide whether the amendment of the complaint is too late and given cases like Conley against Gibson where this Court has said... instructed lower courts, be generous to pro se litigants as far as amendment is concerned?</text>
