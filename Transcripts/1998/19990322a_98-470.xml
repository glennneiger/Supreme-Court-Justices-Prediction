            <label>Mr. Charles Alan Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="47.742" offset="329042">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="52.556" offset="348268">This case presents a single technical jurisdictional procedural issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.801" offset="381287">It is a case clearly of first impression here, it would not be here if you had ruled on it before, but despite all those negatives, I submit that the case raises important issues both about the efficient functioning of the district courts and about the proper relation between courts of the States and courts of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.308" offset="487344">Although I view it as a case of first impression, I believe that a line of cases from this Court has established a rule of law, and that from that rule of law we can find the answer to this particular issue, and the rule of law that I believe your cases support is that a Federal court may make a wide variety of decisions prior to determining whether or not it has subject matter jurisdiction of the case, but that it may not decide any issue that relates to the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.572" offset="632376">We believe that that is the line that was clearly drawn in Steel Co. and a line that has been drawn in many of the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.578" offset="668425">Your cases say that the... that a court can pass on the issue of class certification without deciding whether or not it has subject matter jurisdiction, that was Amchem, of course, that a court can hold that a lower court properly exercised its discretion in declining to use pendent jurisdiction without deciding whether pendent jurisdiction existed under the circumstances of the case; that a court can order Younger abstention, though it hasn't decided whether it has subject matter jurisdiction, that was Ellis v. Dyson; that a court can rule on a tag bar to habeas corpus without deciding whether there was a prisoner in custody, whether there is a final... an independent adequate judgment reason that would bar review by any Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.939" offset="917842">We believe that there is a line of cases that provide the rule by which this case is to be measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.144" offset="946681">Then, immediately I ask myself, should there be an exception to that rule of law where, as here, the issue that the Federal court decided, without deciding whether it had subject matter jurisdiction, is one that would have preclusive effect so that it would bar a State court from making an independent judgment on that?</text>
            <text syncTime="230.572" offset="1060366">I submit that there should not be an exception to the usual rule on those grounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="362.622" offset="1588562">Let us suppose that in this case our only argument for Federal jurisdiction was fraudulent joinder and therefore diversity, an argument that Norge should not have been a party and then there would have been complete diversity, and that the basis of the argument for fraudulent joinder is that even if there was personal jurisdiction with regard to the claims of Marathon there was not personal jurisdiction with regard to the claims of Norge.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.299" offset="1687305">And let us suppose that the Federal court says no, you were wrong, there is personal jurisdiction over Norge's claim, therefore Norge is properly a party, therefore there is no diversity, and remands the case to the State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.288" offset="1747282">In my submission we could not then come in and seek to relitigate the issue in State court of whether there was personal jurisdiction of the claims of Norge against us.</text>

            <text syncTime="437.290" offset="1887298">It seems that you give no weight at all to subject matter jurisdiction as having some sort of a priority over personal jurisdiction, assuming both are of equivalent difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.922" offset="1941737">And isn't there a Federal interest in allowing the State in an instance somewhat like this to have the first opportunity to address its own long arm statute... assuming there's subject matter jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction... in the district court or questions of equal difficulty?</text>

            <text syncTime="479.038" offset="2054273">Well, I think that an important determinant in guiding the discretion would be the extent to which this would require the Federal court to pass on difficult issues of State law, the extent to which the questions of personal jurisdiction are intertwined with the question of subject matter jurisdiction, as, indeed, we think they are here, that all those would be relevant considerations in deciding which issue you would address first.</text>

            <text syncTime="2870.149" offset="11618642">The burden of proof is, under the Kawasaki case in the Texas supreme court, the burden of proof is on the defendant to disprove every ground of personal jurisdiction, whereas the burden of proof applied in Federal court is, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff, so that's one difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="2889.744" offset="11697114">Well, that seems odd for some reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.402" offset="11703697">Mr. Hutchinson, isn't that a Federal, the whole thing a Federal question?</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.996" offset="11726057">Here, the assertion is there is no power over me compatible with due process, and since the Texas statute goes the length of due process, we don't have to worry about it, we stop short of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.944" offset="11773914">It's a question of due process, and yet you're suggesting that the State court could have a burden of proof that makes it easier for a plaintiff to assert jurisdiction over a defendant than in the Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.475" offset="11828039">I would think that that, since it's a Federal constitutional question, would have to come out the same way with the same burdens in both courts, and if the Texas courts have said something different, the defendant has to negate jurisdiction, that's--</text>

            <text syncTime="2938.954" offset="11893868">Justice Ginsburg, what I think the point here in this particular case is that the issues of due process are intertwined with State law and with the factual situation, because one of the issues in the due process argument was, under the Texas long arm statute was, was there a tort in Texas?</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.268" offset="11983207">I think the court got this wrong, but the issue that the court addressed was, was there a completed tortious act within the State which involved an analysis of tort law as well as the facts, so that--</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Alan Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="2978.871" offset="12053528">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.913" offset="12069724">Let me first speak to the issue that was just discussed about burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.928" offset="12097832">We did not discuss that in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.299" offset="12107236">We didn't think it important enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.421" offset="12111729">The Fifth Circuit in fact has held that the Texas burden rule is, quote, exactly the sort of State procedural accessory that Federal courts are not bound to don whenever they enter the diversity courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.280" offset="12163243">That's Product Promotions 495 F. 2d 483.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.842" offset="12181424">The Texas supreme court has held that if a plaintiff does not allege that defendant has performed a specific act in Texas, then the mere finding or allegation that defendant is a nonresident is enough to carry his burden of proof, so I really think the burden of proof issue here is not significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.637" offset="12268673">I go back to Justice Kennedy's question to my friend: Suppose that pleading, the summons and complaint are served on Norge... as I pronounce it, and others have different pronunciations... in Germany, and they say, well, we've not been in Texas, we're not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.064" offset="12374312">Let us suppose that the case had been brought in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.275" offset="12391239">If the position for which Marathon has been arguing here is right, it would be necessary for Norge to come in, litigate complicated and novel matters of Federal subject matter jurisdiction, when it says we have an easy personal jurisdiction objection, an objection that is constitutionally raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.183" offset="12490818">And what I think highlights the illogicality of that is that, as we know, if you are served and you believe that you are not subject to personal jurisdiction to the court of the State, you can simply refuse to go there, do nothing, and collaterally attack the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.146" offset="12566678">If you go there as in Baldwin and litigate the personal jurisdiction issue, you cannot then raise it in an enforcement action, but if you simply ignore the first action, you can then challenge any judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.714" offset="12612967">I don't think that's what we want to encourage people to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.224" offset="12626968">We don't want them deciding for themselves what the law is and gambling that they will later be held to be right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.790" offset="12649225">We want them to go into court and present their objection in an orderly way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.602" offset="12668451">But if my defendant comes in and says, I'm not subject to your personal jurisdiction, Madam Federal Judge, it seems to me that it is wrong to say that that defendant must litigate issues of Federal subject matter jurisdiction rather than having the case dismissed because there is no in personam jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.406" offset="12759670">That, of course, I'm there positing, because my friend Mr. Hutchinson says his rule applies across the board to all cases, original and removed, and in an original jurisdiction case I think that would simply be an intolerable rule, and I don't think that it has much more logic to commend it when it is in a case that is in the Federal court by virtue of removal.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3180.964" offset="12861966">Do you acknowledge, Mr. Wright, that there's a stronger case for what Mr. Hutchinson proposes in the removal situation, or does it really come down to the same thing anyway, just a Federal court acting beyond its... allegedly acting beyond its subject matter jurisdiction?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Alan Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="3201.167" offset="12942737">Well... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.408" offset="12951723">Justice Scalia, I think that the Federalism component becomes more significant when it is a removed case, that here is an issue that... here is a case that if it had not been wrongly taken to Federal court, as we presuppose a Federal lack of subject matter jurisdiction, that the State court would get to decide the matter, that there would be a dignitary interest in the State court there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.025" offset="13058198">So I think yes, that is an element that has to be taken into the scales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.999" offset="13074080">But I quoted, at page 23 of my opening brief, a sentence from Justice Black's opinion in Younger v. Harris that has for years been my mantra with regard to Federalism, that it means neither strict obeisance to State's rights, nor regarding the Federal Government as in control of everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.013" offset="13158090">It regards... it requires a sensitive recognition of the interests of each of the systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.228" offset="13178988">And I think that in the removal cases such as this one, that the efficiency considerations for the Federal court outweigh the dignitary interest of the State court in retaining the power to decide the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.457" offset="13243876">If there are no further questions, I thank the Court.</text>
