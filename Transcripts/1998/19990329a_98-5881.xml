            <text syncTime="66.905" offset="414542">Over the years, this Court has spoke in disparate, sometimes sharply divided voices regarding many Confrontation Clause issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.329" offset="444217">However, this Court has been of one voice concerning confessions of an accomplice given in custody incriminating a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.887" offset="478490">They have been consistently viewed as inevitably suspect, inherently unreliable, less reliable than ordinary hearsay, and presumptively inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.781" offset="514017">The opportunity to cross examine an accomplice regarding a statement incriminating the accused lies at the core of the Confrontation Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="105.630" offset="569396">Your Honor, I think the... the test for that is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.953" offset="582666">I think the... the test for that depends on many other things about the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.826" offset="598235">First, a court needs to look at whether it's against that person's penal interest and then you start with the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.690" offset="621641">And then the question becomes whether the statement is such, the circumstances and whether one looks in Wright at just the circumstances of making the confession or the totality of the circumstances... whether the circumstances are such that cross examination of the declarant, of the accomplice, would be of marginal utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.373" offset="700426">That's the bedrock.</text>

            <text syncTime="139.183" offset="703666">Well, you... you can say that about any number of well established hearsay exceptions, that perhaps it would have been better if... if there had been cross examination, but those have, nonetheless, been rooted in the hearsay exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.681" offset="753612">And it seems to me that you've got to deal with not just the statements in our opinions about confessions of accomplices, but also about declarations against penal interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="165.432" offset="808573">I think, however, that in dealing with the firmly rooted hearsay exceptions that were viewed as an exception, if you will, under the Confrontation Clause, this Court has observed that those exceptions were such that cross examination of virtually any declarant who fell within such an exception would be of marginal utility, and that is not the case with statements of an accomplice for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.017" offset="902928">One, with respect to a statement of an accomplice incriminating a defendant, those statements are, as this Court has observed and in situations where it's against the accomplice's penal interest, that those are inevitably suspect and inherently admissible.</text>

            <text syncTime="223.730" offset="1041795">Your Honor, if you consider the confession of the accomplice Thomas in Lee where the core of that confession is, is that Lee and I planned the murder of Aunt Beedie, Thomas would not have been responsible at all for the murder of Aunt Beedie absent that confession, as... as was... was noted in the dissent by Justice Blackmun in the Lee case.</text>

            <text syncTime="248.536" offset="1141060">The... the confession of Mr. Thomas in the Lee case was unambiguously against his penal interest, and despite that, it was held by the Court in Lee that the right of Lee to confront Thomas on the stand on cross examination was required by the Confrontation Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="279.735" offset="1265821">No, Your Honor, I don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.248" offset="1271881">I think that... that what... that what a court has to first do is recognize that there's a different test for custodial statements of an accomplice that incriminated a defendant than just declarations against penal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.426" offset="1320573">I think that's what this Court was getting at in footnote 5 of Lee when it said that in looking for whether there's a Confrontation Clause exception for this category, the category we're dealing with is not declarations against penal interest, but confessions of an accomplice.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.386" offset="1380446">And then what one has to look is whether the circumstances are such that cross examination would be of marginal utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.480" offset="1404792">I can imagine... and I think there are situations where... because we do not ask for a per se rule... where there would be circumstances that were such that cross examination would be of marginal utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.087" offset="1447215">The types of factors that a court could look at would be, one... and these are all suggested by these... by this Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.381" offset="1472397">One, is the... is the accomplice admitting or implicating himself in something more than he's implicating the accused?</text>
            <text syncTime="340.968" offset="1510745">Two, is there blame shifting involved in the sense that blame shifting was defined by Justice Kennedy's concurrence in Williamson?</text>
            <text syncTime="348.061" offset="1539166">Is there blame shifting?</text>
            <text syncTime="348.972" offset="1542823">Is the... is the accomplice attempting to shift blame?</text>
            <text syncTime="352.654" offset="1557556">If he's not, that's another factor in favor of finding an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.697" offset="1577723">Third, was the statement spontaneous?</text>
            <text syncTime="359.628" offset="1585455">Was the statement done in response to leading questions?</text>
            <text syncTime="363.030" offset="1599039">But the... fourth, was it in custody?</text>
            <text syncTime="366.042" offset="1611055">Because this Court's decisions have also made very plain that situations in custody are different than a situation--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="373.379" offset="1640417">Well, it's made it plain so far is admissibility of evidence against the declarant.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.310" offset="1656090">The Miranda warnings, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.222" offset="1667793">I don't know that it's said that custody makes a great deal of... of difference so far as the... say, an admission against penal interest where the declarant isn't present.</text>

          <turn speaker="ira_s_sacks" startTime="388.676" stopTime="509.177">
            <label>Mr. Ira S. Sacks</label>
            <text syncTime="388.676" offset="1701648">--Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, with all due respect, I think that in Williamson, which I agree is a... is a Federal rule 804(b)(3) case, that the... that the discussion in Williamson about the difference under the Federal rules, 804(b)(3), of a... of a... of a statement to another prisoner, as in Dutton v. Evans, as opposed to a statement in custody makes a great deal of difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.916" offset="1806555">And... and that makes sense, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.358" offset="1816273">This... this case... in this case you have a situation where Gary Barker was questioned before Mark Lilly.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.360" offset="1836335">The police... and this is not to ascribe any bad motives of the police, but just to talk about the normal situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.585" offset="1861204">Mark Lilly is then questioned, but both of his statements indicate, on the face of the statements, that there was questioning of Mark Lilly before the tape was turned on.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.789" offset="1902059">In the first statement that was taken from Mark Lilly, he gets to a point where he... where he says to... to... to Investigator Price in response to tell us what happened, nothing that you... you already don't know, man.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.448" offset="1952632">In the second one... in the... in the statement taken by Mr.... by Investigator or Detective Hamlin, the tape is turned on at 2 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.895" offset="1986487">Mr. Hamlin says, it's 2 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.887" offset="1994428">Then they paused for him to sign the Miranda statement, and then it goes back on at 2:30.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.279" offset="2016057">In situations like that, there's every reason to say that there's something different about a carefully tailored confession in custody in terms of its reliability than a statement that somebody walks up to somebody else on the street or walks up to somebody else in the prison yard and says, you know, by the way, you know, if it wasn't for that guy Evans, I wouldn't be here right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.114" offset="2103306">But the bedrock it seems to me, Your Honor, under this Court's decisions is you have a right to confrontation and there's an exception to the right to confrontation if the nature of the statement is such that cross examination of the declarant would be of marginal utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.035" offset="2171016">Now, that may be a hard test, but that's what the Sixth Amendment is about.</text>

            <text syncTime="521.486" offset="2232874">Well, you know, it's... it's at... the answer is that we would be happy if this Court decided to adopt the view of Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, in Wright because we believe that either under Lee and what I would call existing case law or under the suggestion by Justice Thomas in White and the concurrence that a hard and fast rule be used for the Confrontation Clause, we think that either way, the decision has to be reversed because as I understand the concurring opinion in White it would extend the right of confrontation to witnesses who testify and to testimonial material such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, and confessions, and there would not be an exception for reliable statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.824" offset="2402147">In the words of Justice Thomas at page 363 of the opinion, nor does it seem likely that the drafters of the Sixth Amendment intended to permit a defendant to be tried on the basis of ex parte affidavits found to be reliable.</text>

            <text syncTime="970.860" offset="4030307">And two, the reason for looking at it is because this Court has observed with respect to some firmly rooted hearsay exceptions that virtually all evidence within them meets the constitutional norm and makes the declarant someone whose cross examination would be of marginal utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.501" offset="4100942">And it is important for this Court and other courts not to forget that that's the reason why we look at firmly rooted exceptions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1349.909" offset="5546559">I think that in the abstract under the current way that this Court has tested statements of an accomplice, that it doesn't fall within... it probably doesn't fall within a hearsay exception and it probably doesn't fall within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.</text>

            <text syncTime="1400.052" offset="5747075">Mr. Chief Justice, I was using that as a shorthand to the suggestion in the questioning that what position would the petitioner take with respect to this Court's adoption of the position asserted by Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, in the concurrence in White.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.623" offset="5809351">And... and it is... it is an alternative only in terms of our advocacy and not in terms of this Court's doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.418" offset="5828577">That is quite correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.367" offset="5832338">But the... the issue for the firmly rooted question is whether the evidence at issue or the category of evidence at issue falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception and not whether there is an exception out there in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.986" offset="5890853">And this Court in footnote 5 in Lee indicated we think plainly... and I realize it was in a footnote... and correctly that in cases like this, saying that it's a declaration against penal interest is too broad a category for Confrontation Clause analysis, and you have to... and... and that the courts have to recognize that what this is is a statement of an accomplice incriminating the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.303" offset="5988133">And there's a good reason for making that distinction because as we pointed out in our reply brief, the treatment of declarations against penal interest and the treatment of the subcategory of... of statements of an accomplice incriminating a defendant under the Federal rules is different and under various State laws are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.162" offset="6055528">Now, the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation also spends a lot of time talking about how in 1968 when Bruton was decided, declarations against penal interest were not as widespread, but they're very widespread now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.283" offset="6116028">And we think that also misses the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.145" offset="6123447">We think the point is not how widespread declarations against penal interest as an exception to hearsay was in 1968, or in 1994 when Williamson was decided, but whether custodial statements of an accomplice which incriminate a defendant are more reliable today than they were in 1968 when Bruton was decided or 1994 when Williamson was decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="3352.611" offset="13557373">Mark Lilly was reluctant, and the fact that his... his statements were I believe genuinely self inculpatory.</text>
