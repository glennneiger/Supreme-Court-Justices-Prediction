            <text syncTime="63.323" offset="387074">Petitioner is here today to complain about an insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.025" offset="401807">In this case the insurance company is a fiscal intermediary serving as the agent for the Government, reviewing medicare cost reports, making determinations about allowable cost, and also making decisions about whether or not the cost report may be reopened.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.618" offset="464188">In this case, the petitioner, a home health agency, discovered new and material evidence after the initial period for requesting appeal, and therefore made a request for a reopening of the cost report.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.592" offset="512149">The intermediary, the insurance company, denied the request to reopen, considered this a final determination, and then we filed an appeal for review of that final agency action at the Provider Reimbursement Review Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.102" offset="566170">The review board declined to accept the case, stating it did not have jurisdiction to review the refusal to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.689" offset="596472">The district court upheld the jurisdictional decision of the board and the Sixth Circuit also upheld the district court, which brings us here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.545" offset="631894">We would like to begin with the statement that there is a presumption that there will be judicial review of final agency action, and this presumption is noted in the Court's decision of Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, where the Court's opinion started with saying, we begin with a strong presumption that Congress intends judicial review of administrative action.</text>

            <text syncTime="154.230" offset="750699">We had an opportunity, a chance to make a request for an appeal, but based upon the information that we had at that time, an appeal was not sought, but when we discovered new and material evidence which we believe shows that the intermediary violated its own regulations, upon discovery of the new and material evidence, we believe that gives us the right to request the reopening, and if that reopening is unlawfully withheld, we sought review, and so it's the review of the refusal, which is final agency action, which we are seeking.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.949" offset="965530">The Administrative Procedure Act has an exception for judicial review for matters committed to agency discretion by law, and I have always thought that it's committed to agency discretion whether to reopen a closed case.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.958" offset="1025611">They always can, but I don't think anybody has a right to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.194" offset="1358516">Well, whether or not that refers to just a year-end book-balancing I think has not been decided by this Court, but in fact the Secretary uses that reopening process for more than simply a year-end book-balancing to compare estimated cost with actual cost, and so we would say first of all to Justice Ginsburg's question, there is statutory authority for a reopening within that.</text>

            <text syncTime="362.865" offset="1585154">One is the statutory requirement for reopening, and the other is the normal discretion that any agency has, but a nonreviewable discretion, to reopen a closed matter if it thinks it to be a good idea.</text>

            <text syncTime="2414.254" offset="9790738">The hospital, on the other hand, are by and large very sophisticated entities, and they're actually very good about appealing within the 180 days.</text>

            <text syncTime="2470.753" offset="10016749">There's no reason to presume bad faith on the intermediary with respect to production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.621" offset="10036184">And again, like I said, there's just no reason that the provider didn't appeal in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.625" offset="10060217">If I could also turn to clause (ii), if I could refer to it that way, and that's 1395x(v)(1)(A)(ii), which this Court referred to as clause (ii) in the Good Samaritan case, we think that that... that this decision squarely forecloses any argument that clause (ii) is the basis for reopening and requires a reopening procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.522" offset="10143809">What the Court held in Good Samaritan was that clause (ii) is ambiguous, and it upheld the Secretary's narrow reading as a year-end, and the Court several times referred to it as a year-end book-balancing accounting reconciliation, and that's... that would reconcile the amounts paid to the provider during the year that were simply estimates, pre-audit, periodic payments with the amount that the NPR determined to be allowable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.256" offset="10246731">And that's... actually, if you look at the NPR in this case, it shows that reconciliation, and I think it's on page... I think it's... it's page 36 of the joint appendix, so this is how the Secretary administers the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.501" offset="10319770">This is how the regulations work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.003" offset="10325726">A reopening procedure is something entirely distinct from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.288" offset="10338891">It's a substantive redetermination, or at least a request to redetermine what had been reimbursable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.959" offset="10369611">If I could also address the issue that these are private insurance companies, these are intermediaries making the decision, these are the Secretary's agents and they do act under her close oversight and supervision, and we think it's also significant that intermediaries are nominated by the providers themselves, and if there's some suspicion that the intermediary is biased or unfair the provider is always free to request a change in the intermediary, or not nominate the intermediary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.211" offset="10482565">There's simply no allegation in this case that intermediaries act distinctively with bad faith with respect to reopening as opposed to any other initial decision and, of course, the provider and all hospitals have the opportunity to challenge the initial underlying determination within the 6-month time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.089" offset="10558111">Then if I could also address the question of Section 1331 jurisdiction, in addition to the plain language of section 405(h), the third sentence, which forecloses any action arising under the Medicare Act, this Court in Heckler v. Ringer and again in Weinberger v. Salfi made clear that the Court was not going to look at procedural labels or substantive labels, but would look at whether the standing and substantive basis for the claim arises under the Medicare Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.477" offset="10683603">And so I'm not sure the provider... the provider in this case talks about a collateral challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.047" offset="10709935">That's not from any decision... that doesn't come from any decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.583" offset="10728116">The only exception, of course, is the Michigan Academy decision and that was dealing... a far cry from this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.789" offset="10760926">There was no review whatsoever of the Secretary's regulations under part B, and part A, which involves this case as well, now, as part B, providers are free to raise any kind of challenge before the board and under the part A and part B beneficiary side, the administrative law judge, and in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.018" offset="10837830">They can bring both amount challenges to their benefits, as well as any kind of facial challenge to a regulation, and so we just don't think the Michigan Academy exception or distinction has any relevance to this case, when there was a full right of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.278" offset="10898852">And again, I would also remind the Court about the Sanders decision where, under the Social Security Act, there is no right of review, and the Court made clear in that case that 1331 was... excuse me, that section 405(h) barred jurisdiction, Federal question jurisdiction under section 1331.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.923" offset="10973458">Then if I could just finally address mandamus, the mandamus aspect of this, which the petitioner also relies on, we think mandamus is barred by the second sentence of section 405(h), but in all events there is no basis for seeking mandamus relief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.669" offset="11056423">The two challenges are, of course, the refusal to reopen, and then the underlying complaint about the owner's compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.925" offset="11093412">Both of those require discretion on the part of the intermediary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.127" offset="11110235">The regulations are in the manual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.013" offset="11117758">It's plain on its face that the decision whether to reopen is discretionary, and certainly the question about whether costs are reasonable and allowable under the statute also requires the exercise of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.553" offset="11163943">And as to the underlying claim about entitlement to reimbursement, certainly there's no question that the petitioner failed to exhaust its administrative remedies by not appealing within the time frame.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.277" offset="11214829">If there are no further questions, that completes my argument.</text>
