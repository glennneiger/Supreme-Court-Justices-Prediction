            <text syncTime="65.075" offset="404403">The question in this case is whether the standards of judicial review specified by the Administrative Procedure Act apply to the Federal Circuit's review of decisions of the Patent and Trademark Office's Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences rejecting claims of unsuccessful patent applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.710" offset="498862">The en banc court of appeals held that those standards do not apply, but neither that court nor the respondents contend that by their terms these detailed provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act... neither of them contest that by their terms they would directly apply and would prescribe review of the board's factual findings under the substantial evidence standard set forth in section 706(2)(E) of Title 5, set forth on page 5 of our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="140.493" offset="706065">Let's talk about the standard of the scope of review under the statute, 706, which says that under the APA the reviewing court will hold unlawful agency action found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law, subsection (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="164.790" offset="803241">Now I would have thought that was the standard that we would be talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.864" offset="823512">Somehow the Government, having espoused that for years, has now backed off, says no, it's under (E), unsupported by substantial evidence in a case subject to sections 556 and 557 of this title or otherwise reviewed on the record of an agency hearing provided by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.714" offset="894878">I don't see how (E) applies to this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="237.178" offset="1092782">The patent code specifies that review in the court of appeals is to be on the administrative record, and while these are not hearings subject to sections 556 and 557 of the act, they are in our view, and we conceded before the en banc court, otherwise reviewed on the record of an agency hearing provided by statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.607" offset="1270519">I thought that the distinction is that the arbitrary-capricious standard, the first standard, applies to all determinations, determinations of policy, determinations of fact that are not based on a closed record and so forth, and that the substantial evidence test is merely one instance of what constitutes arbitrary or capricious action when you are... when you are making a determination on a closed record.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.127" offset="1388592">That is to say, if you have a closed record and there is not even substantial evidence in that record to support your factual determination, substantial evidence being the amount of evidence that would take a jury case to the jury, if you don't have that, it has to be arbitrary or capricious anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.058" offset="1460272">But this is just a specification of what arbitrariness and capriciousness consists of with regard to fact-finding on a closed record.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.085" offset="1676357">Certainly I could find nothing that supports that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.866" offset="1687538">Rather, it's like any other agency proceeding, say, informal rulemaking, where of course you review it in a court of appeals, informal rulemaking on the record before the agency, but it was not in the sense of 556, 557, or what I think is a second clause here, not record in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.060" offset="1764338">So you can explain to me, what is this proceeding like before the Patent Office.</text>

            <text syncTime="1707.282" offset="6973154">This is basically a question of statutory construction, of construction of section 12 of the Administrative Procedure Act as originally adopted, and what we have here are two or three, we believe, relatively straight-forward questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.552" offset="7030310">The first is whether the judicial review standard applies or is covered, encompassed by section 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.007" offset="7068135">Section 12 starts out that, nothing in this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.263" offset="7089138">We believe that that covers the preceding sections rather clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.183" offset="7104811">Likewise judicial review is, we believe, a requirement because judicial review imposes upon the agency an obligation to meet a certain standard, here that its evidence meet the clearly erroneous test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.183" offset="7164788">Then there are two questions related to the clearly erroneous test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.707" offset="7182865">First, does the clearly erroneous test constitute an additional requirement beyond that imposed by the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.542" offset="7214212">Again, we believe that this Court has spoken on that issue relatively clearly in 1993 in the Concrete Products case, which we researched after receiving the Government's reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.618" offset="7258516">And there this Court said that review under the clearly erroneous standard is significantly deferential, requiring a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed, and application of a reasonableness standard, i.e., the substantial evidence test, is even more deferential, so what we have here is an additional requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.784" offset="7355169">In addition, we have under the clearly erroneous test what we believe is clearly recognized law.</text>
