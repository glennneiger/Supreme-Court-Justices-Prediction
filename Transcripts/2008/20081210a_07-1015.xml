            <label>Mr. Gregory G. Garre</label>
            <text syncTime="7.570" offset="137718">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns the qualified immunity of high-ranking government officials, like the Attorney General of the United States and Director of the FBI, and supervisory liability claims under Bivens based on the alleged wrongdoing of much lower level officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.298" offset="204696">In concluding that the complaint in this case was sufficient to subject the high-ranking officials, like the Attorney General, to the demands of civil discovery, the court of appeals erred in two fundamental and interrelated respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.423" offset="253179">First, the court erred in concluding that the complaint stated a violation of clearly established rights by the former Attorney General and Director of the FBI, because under this Court's precedents the complaint fails adequately to plead the personal involvement of those high-ranking officials for the alleged discriminatory acts of lower level officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.170" offset="332173">And, second--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="56.620" offset="333949">General Garre, will you clarify one point?</text>
            <text syncTime="60.955" offset="351295">You said "fails to state" enough to overcome qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.060" offset="379716">But, usually, these -- the pleading is analyzed discretely.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.696" offset="402286">This is a 12(b)(6) motion, is it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Gregory G. Garre</label>

          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="77.583" stopTime="109.221">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="77.583" offset="417750">And so that tests just the pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.868" offset="430916">Qualified immunity is an affirmative defense which hasn't even been stated formally.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.641" offset="466024">So isn't it entirely conceivable that you could have a good complaint judged from the 12(b)(6) point of view, but when the qualified immunity defense is asserted, the plaintiff isn't able to come up with enough to stave off a summary judgment motion?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gregory_g_garre" startTime="109.221" stopTime="170.093">
            <label>Mr. Gregory G. Garre</label>
            <text syncTime="109.221" offset="544392">No, for two reasons, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.571" offset="553796">The first is that this Court has recognized that a defense can be a basis for a motion to dismiss under 12(b)(6).</text>
            <text syncTime="118.160" offset="580127">It did so most recently in the Jones versus Bock case.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.460" offset="589322">And -- and it's established practice in the Federal courts, in part because of this decision, that appeals from the denial of a motion to dismiss on the ground of qualified immunity are appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.766" offset="626521">And, second, as the Second Circuit recognized -- and we think it got this right -- the question of whether a complaint adequately pleads the personal involvement of government officials goes directly to the question of qualified immunity -- and the court of appeals said that on page 14a of its decision -- because it goes to the question of whether these defendants have violated any clearly established rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.548" offset="709695">And so the question of supervisory liability in this case we think is essential to the question of whether or not the Attorney General and Director of the FBI are entitled to qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.904" offset="747102">And in denying the government's -- the Petitioner's motion to dismiss on the ground of qualified immunity, the district court erroneously deprived these Petitioners of the protections of that important defense.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="170.093" stopTime="203.481">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="170.093" offset="787853">Well, Mr. Garre, isn't there more involved here than simply derivative liability for the acts of others?</text>
            <text syncTime="176.264" offset="812513">I -- I've got a bunch of excerpts from the complaint, but let me just go to one, on section -- paragraph, rather, 97.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.436" offset="849189">That charges the defendants Ashcroft and Mueller with willfully and maliciously designing a policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.708" offset="886282">It doesn't sound like respondeat superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.445" offset="901224">I mean, it seems to -- to charge them directly with coming up with what these people are complaining about.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gregory G. Garre</label>
            <text syncTime="203.481" offset="921391">Well, I think that that's fair, Justice Souter.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.266" offset="928496">I mean, I think that there are two general types of allegations in this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.301" offset="940722">One set of allegations says that Petitioners came up with this policy, and if you look at those allegations -- and I think I would point you to paragraph 69 and paragraphs 10 and 11 -- those allegations we think describe a policy which is neutral on its face, a policy of holding persons determined by the FBI to be of interest in connection with a terribly important investigation until they have been cleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.999" offset="1035494">And so we think that those allegations can't be enough to sustain these -- to subject these Petitioners to -- to civil discovery.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="240.772" offset="1070602">Well, why don't -- may I just interrupt you there?</text>
            <text syncTime="242.872" offset="1078962">Why don't you think the reference here in the language I just read, to designing a policy, includes the policy which is several times described as being one which called for holding -- for Arab Muslim men of certain countries of origin without reference to any penal purpose?</text>
            <text syncTime="266.221" offset="1172376">I mean, that -- I think that is adequately described in there as part of the policy.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gregory_g_garre" startTime="271.724" stopTime="333.032">
            <label>Mr. Gregory G. Garre</label>
            <text syncTime="271.724" offset="1194318">I think if you look at the complaint, that -- that interpretation doesn't hold up.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.410" offset="1209156">And in particular, I would point you to paragraph 48, which is on page 164a of the joint appendix -- I'm sorry, the petition appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.266" offset="1244578">And what that paragraph says is that these allegedly discriminatory determinations, classifications, were made by FBI officials in the field, not Petitioners here, the former Attorney General and director of the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.692" offset="1298286">And importantly, these determinations were made, quote, and this comes from paragraph 48,</text>
            <text syncTime="302.578" offset="1317825">"without specific criteria or uniform classification system. "</text>
            <text syncTime="306.898" offset="1335066">And so that's what's going on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.381" offset="1341022">You've got a complaint that alleges that specific lower level officials are making these determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.868" offset="1362965">That's in paragraphs 50 and 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.820" offset="1370697">You've got a complaint alleging that these determinations are being made on the basis of ad hoc criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.224" offset="1392327">That's page 48.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.274" offset="1396611">And then you have these overarching allegations that the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI knew about, approved, and condoned these discriminatory conduct of much lower level officials.</text>

            <text syncTime="355.028" offset="1527536">That policy we have not disputed, and that policy we think is a -- is a factually neutral, perfectly lawful law enforcement response to the 9/11 attacks, resulting in--</text>

            <text syncTime="365.836" offset="1570795">Well, it may -- it may very well be, but isn't it, for purposes of a complaint, sufficient to raise a due process claim by saying what they say?</text>
            <text syncTime="376.728" offset="1614367">In other words, you -- you may have a very good defense to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.180" offset="1628160">You may have something that does not ever get beyond -- get them beyond the point of summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.167" offset="1652088">But for them simply to charge that there was a policy in which they picked up people and they held them until they were cleared, i.e., sort of demonstrated to be innocent in some way, that at least on the face of it seems to -- to state a due process problem under the Fifth Amendment, doesn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="451.340" offset="1912790">But just as in the Bell Atlantic case, where that was an option, too, and where the defendants in that case did not avail themselves of their opportunity to file a motion for a more definite statement, the Petitioners here did not do so and they were not required to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.632" offset="1965976">They had a different option under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to move for dismissal under 12(b)(6).</text>
            <text syncTime="469.702" offset="1986247">They exercised that option, and the complaint -- the complaint should be dismissed because it fails to state a claim against those individuals.</text>

            <text syncTime="478.891" offset="2023027">But the difference in my mind between this and Bell Atlantic was that, in Bell Atlantic you had a set of allegations in which in -- in effect it was an either-or choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.163" offset="2060121">There were two possibilities consistent with the allegations in Bell Atlantic.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.417" offset="2081123">One was a conspiracy possibility; one was a -- a lawful parallel conduct possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.305" offset="2104738">And there just wasn't any way to pick one as being a more probable interpretation of what they were getting at.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.494" offset="2141414">Here the problem is not so much an eitheror choice as to which we are clueless, but a just vagueness or uncertainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.432" offset="2177149">Does the -- Does the talk about the -- the racial criterion go to the policy as devised or the policy as implemented?</text>

            <text syncTime="528.390" offset="2221035">And it seems to me that here we're -- we're in a kind of conceptually a squishier situation and it might be better to get a more definite statement than to say, well, you -- you've got to make a choice, and there's no way to make a choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="546.635" offset="2293969">I think the general claim of a policy of holding suspects until cleared is much more like the Bell Atlantic situation, where you have got factually neutral allegations, perfectly lawful law enforcement conduct to have a policy that says, FBI agents, if you determine these people are of interest, hold them until they are cleared so that we are not releasing people that are potentially suspects or wrongdoers in this investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1320.029" offset="5387598">And, I think, in order to evaluate the adequacy of the pleadings, this Court has to have in mind the standards of supervisory liability that Bivens applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1336.391" offset="5453009">And second: No, our case would not go away if this Court got rid of Bell Atlantic or if this Court limited Bell Atlantic to the antitrust context.</text>

            <text syncTime="1639.199" offset="6664255">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think I should start with paragraph 69 of the complaint because I think Petitioners' treatment of paragraph 69 shows why they have no coherent theory of what a conclusory allegation is and what it's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.076" offset="6731755">Because what does paragraph 69 do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.862" offset="6742936">It sets out a policy, and it says that Petitioners approved the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.730" offset="6758400">Paragraph 96 does exactly the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.765" offset="6770521">Paragraph 69 you can find at 168 of the appendix; paragraph 96 you can find at 172 to 173.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.585" offset="6801763">In both -- in both cases it does the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.037" offset="6811585">We have Petitioners approving a policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.073" offset="6823811">Now, Petitioners here conceded at oral argument, contrary to their reply brief but consistent with their opening brief, that paragraph 69 states a factual allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.678" offset="6862158">So if paragraph 69 states a factual allegation that is entitled to be considered true, then paragraph 96 states a factual allegation that is entitled to be considered to be true.</text>

            <text syncTime="3046.903" offset="12295105">--May I ask you this question?</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.536" offset="12301584">And -- and I ask it, you know, mindful of what you've just said, but I -- I'm not sure that the two issues can be kept as -- as separated as you suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.378" offset="12340976">Another avenue to responding to the problem, I think, that Justice Breyer's last hypo raised would be as follows -- and then I'll tell you the difficulty that I have with it, and I was going ask you to comment on the difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.054" offset="12407641">He said that the -- the allegation -- one way to read the allegation, and I think a fair way, is to say that the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI devised a policy and condoned the implementation of a policy that was based on racial and religious grounds with no penological purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.467" offset="12485381">Well, under the circumstances of immediate post-9/11, it is not surprising necessarily that they -- they devised a policy that had reference to religion and national origin and so on, given what we knew about the hijackers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.143" offset="12548075">What is not so easy to accept, as a matter of adequate pleading, is the claim that there was no penological interest involved in the decision of how to and how long to hold the individuals who were picked up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.586" offset="12609829">One answer to that, which I think is -- is in your pleadings, is that you refer to specific individuals and in particular to your own client, who was in the position of being held under these conditions for a considerable period of time, and it turns out there's -- there's no indication that there was ultimately a justified penological interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.102" offset="12707840">So that might be your answer to Justice Breyer's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.006" offset="12723513">There's enough in here about specific detentions to make it plausible for pleading standards that they were being held without any penological interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.361" offset="12764891">The difficulty I have with that line of thinking is this: You also allege in there that lower level officials were making decisions on an ad hoc basis without adequate criteria as to -- as to how they should make them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.887" offset="12831033">And that particular line of allegations suggests that what was really going on here, including what was happening to your client, wasn't the result of -- of clear policy decisions made by the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI, but they -- they were just being scattered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.998" offset="12903445">So, what in the context of your whole pleading makes it adequate simply to charge on a conclusory basis that these two defendants were devising a policy that had -- that was intended to have an effect of no penological interest?</text>
