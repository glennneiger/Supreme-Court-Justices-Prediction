            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="9.839" offset="39316">This case comes to us from the Supreme Court of Hawaii after the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.885" offset="71499">The United States annexed Hawaii as a territory and years later, admitted it to the Union as the 58th State.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.195" offset="104727">In 1993, Congress passed an Apology Resolution which apologized to the native Hawaiians on behalf of the people of the United States for the overthrow of Hawaiian monarchy.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.975" offset="155927">After the enactment of the Apology Resolution, respondent Office of Hawaiian Affairs filed this lawsuit in the Hawaii State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.888" offset="187483">Respondent claimed that the Apology Resolution constituted a congressional recognition of unrelinquished land claims held by native Hawaiians against the State of Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.806" offset="235235">Respondent therefore sought an injunction to prevent the State from selling its sovereign lands pending resolution of those unrelinquished claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.874" offset="271492">The state trial court denied respondents' request for relief but the Supreme Court of Hawaii reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.169" offset="296675">Relying on the Apology Resolution, the State Supreme Court agreed with respondent and barred the State from selling certain of its lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.697" offset="330738">We conclude that the Apology Resolution did not purport to have legal effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.075" offset="348292">Indeed, the resolution would create serious constitutional concerns if it had attempted to cloud Hawaii's title to its sovereign lands more than three decades after the State's admission to the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.590" offset="394372">For this and other reasons set out in an opinion filed today with the clerk, we reverse the decision of the Supreme Court of Hawaii and remand for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.984" offset="431884">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
