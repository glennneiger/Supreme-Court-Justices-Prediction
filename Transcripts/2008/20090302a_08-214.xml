            <label>Mr. David W. McCreadie</label>
            <text syncTime="7.087" offset="134813">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Mr. Townsend is a Jones Act seaman who seeks punitive damages for the willful failure to pay maintenance and cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.996" offset="190401">Like the unseaworthiness claim in Miles, Mr. Townsend's maintenance and cure claim is a general maritime law cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.554" offset="236690">Mr. Townsend cannot recover punitive damages under his general maritime law cause of action because those damages are unavailable under the Jones Act FELA, and to a lesser extent DOHSA.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.064" offset="306698">This Court's decision in Miles requires uniformity between the damages that a seaman can recover under general maritime law and the damages that a seaman can recover under the guiding statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.708" offset="373258">Those guiding statutes again are the Jones Act, the FELA, and the DOHSA.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="76.916" offset="414114">Mr. McCreadie, in this case, why is it necessary to get into that, whether they are punitive damages under FELA and the Jones Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="88.356" offset="459880">If we accept, as I think we must, Townsend's allegations to be true, he has said that Atlantic, as a matter of routine, puts in a boilerplate complaint for declaratory relief, reciting all the reasons why somebody could not get maintenance and cure, even though that is patently false, the allegation, for example, that he deserted his post.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.195" offset="599270">He says it's false.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.164" offset="603136">He says the allegation that he falsified his application for employment is false.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.783" offset="625601">Accepting the -- that to be true at this stage, isn't there some kind of punitive measure to be taken against a litigant who abuses the court process in that way?</text>

            <text syncTime="160.404" offset="748063">We're assuming -- they may well turn out to be false; but at the threshold under 12(b)6 we accept those allegations as true and then determine whether a claim is stated.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="190.189" offset="867182">But let's take this out of the maintenance and cure spot altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.125" offset="882960">Litigation generally, if a court determines that a litigant is abusing the court's process by filing false pleadings, is there a remedy; and if so, what is it?</text>

            <text syncTime="212.539" offset="956625">And that's what Vaughan v. Atkinson provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.657" offset="969059">In that case the -- this Court looked at abuse of the litigation process and determined that the plaintiff in that case was entitled to attorneys' fees.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="229.714" offset="1025275">I thought that all that was at stake there was whether the employer wrongfully withheld maintenance and cure that was owing.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.356" offset="1071877">The allegations made by Townsend go far beyond that they just unreasonably denied him maintenance and cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.395" offset="1104060">They suggest that this litigant, as a matter practice, standard operating procedure, makes false claims before a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.222" offset="1163306">And my question to you is, isn't across the board there a sanction, wholly apart from the particular claim, for a litigant who abuses the court's processes?</text>

            <text syncTime="474.224" offset="2003299">The case that you refer to, the Amiable Nancy, and other cases, they apply to general maritime law with respect to collisions, now with respect to pollution, and that's a broader context.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.901" offset="2058052">But if we look at the history of general maritime law, if we look at, for example, Calhoun, there's the critical distinction between non-seafarers and seafarers.</text>

            <text syncTime="647.102" offset="2694813">Secondly, Cortes, Supreme Court precedent, tells us that the rules are the same for personal injury and death actions for maintenance and cure under the Jones Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="701.654" offset="2913092">Mr. McCreadie, there's a question about this case, a troublesome feature of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.140" offset="2939005">That is, you are saying because there are no punitive damages available under FELA and under the Jones Act, then there certainly should not be any under maintenance and cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.150" offset="2991041">But if we have to answer those questions, whether there are punitive damages available under FELA and the Jones Act, in the context of a maintenance and cure claim, then we're deciding a much larger question than are punitive damages available for willful refusal to pay maintenance and cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.564" offset="3080694">We're deciding a question under the Jones Act, a question under the FELA, and there are a lot of people who would be interested -- and the seamen are a sizable group that the law cares about particularly -- but there would be a larger interest, a larger interest in the answer in the Jones Act context and FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.179" offset="3179123">And to decide those questions in a case that doesn't present any claim under FELA or any claim under the Jones Act is troublesome.</text>

            <text syncTime="779.503" offset="3224472">--I certainly agree with you, Justice Ginsburg, that the answer to this case answers the question of what damages are available under the Jones Act and -- and FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.627" offset="3268984">But, again, if you look at Miles, which analyzing both FELA cases, Vreeland, for example, and Kraft, which is a railroad case, it -- it has already specifically stated what compensatory -- that compensatory damages alone are available under the death side, admittedly, and that the compensation for a seaman and, therefore, for a FELA employee is limited to compensation for pecuniary loss and for pre-death pain and suffering.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.420" offset="3420076">Also, if we look at another string of Supreme Court precedent, it's not as clear as Miles, but if we look at the -- the other string, it -- it -- this Court has stated over and over that compensatory damages are -- are what is available under the Jones Act; compensatory damages are available under the FELA; and compensatory damages are available under DOHSA.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.557" offset="3552674">For example, Zicherman is a post-Miles case, and it's written and states the principles very clearly: The Jones Act provides -- permits, I should say, compensation only for pecuniary losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.685" offset="3617144">And then it discusses Vreeland, which is a FELA case, and it says that the FELA permits compensation only for pecuniary losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.208" offset="3659254">And so, again, if we -- if we look at the history on the death side, which Miles summarizes, but if we look on the personal injury side, at the Osceola, the Iroquois, Peterson mentions compensatory damages nine times in expressing what remedies are available to seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.073" offset="3750787">And so those railroad cases, those Jones Act cases, have been decided and have been a part of our precedent for 60, 70, 80 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.881" offset="3793941">And, of course, it is important to note that the Congress has amended the Jones Act in 1982, with no tampering with this history.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.891" offset="3854023">It has amended the Jones Act in 2006 with no tampering with the history, and it has amended the Jones Act in 2008 without any change.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.132" offset="3902924">And that's in light of Guevara, decided in 1995; that's in light of Roy Al, decided in 1995, and 10 years plus for the cases to percolate and for Congress to decide whether they agree with those policy determinations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1634.504" offset="6644423">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: I would like to start by answering the question that was raised by Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.742" offset="6673366">This Court does not need to reach the question of whether or not punitive damages are available under the Jones Act or under the FELA in order to decide this issue, because maintenance and cure is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.550" offset="6720596">It precedes the Jones Act by centuries, perhaps even a thousand years, and it deals with a distinctly different problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.953" offset="6750271">Maintenance and cure deals with a situation as what do we do with an injured seaman to get him back to health and get him into the workforce?</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.559" offset="6780677">And the law has provided since Catherine of Aragon went to Greece in the 1200s that the shipowner has a responsibility, in its capacity as a shipowner, to provide that seaman with medical care and to provide that seaman with a living allowance so that he can get better and get back into the work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.704" offset="6857268">Now, in 1920, Senator Jones intended to make the United States Merchant Marine the world's greatest merchant marine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.758" offset="6885480">He was dealing in a factual scenario where 12 years earlier, on April 12th of 1912, the Titanic had sunk; 1,900 people had died.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.982" offset="6926336">Virtually every member of the Senate and Congress knew somebody who was on the Titanic, and during the intervening eight years, certain points of law became obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.319" offset="6959668">First of all, the people who died on the Titanic could not recover for anything except their lost baggage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.706" offset="6985268">They could not recover for the fact that their loved ones had passed away, because there was no cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.544" offset="7004599">Secondly, because the Titanic hit an iceberg and was not unseaworthy, there was no cause of action for negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.550" offset="7036677">So Senator Jones set around to correct these two anomalies in the law, and said what we are going to do is we're going to create a new class of beneficiaries, who are dependents of people who die at sea, and we are going to give them the right to recover pecuniary damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.225" offset="7099371">That's the only place where pecuniary damages are mentioned in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.761" offset="7113477">And then it said, and as to seamen, we're going to give them an additional right, a cumulative right on top of unseaworthiness, and that's going to be negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.367" offset="7143884">It never sought out to touch maintenance and cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.069" offset="7158721">Maintenance and cure has been something that's been monitored by the courts ever since its inception, and it is a self-regulating system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.056" offset="7186620">Before Guevara, shipowners regularly provided their employees with medical care without asking the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.912" offset="7218072">If there was a close call, they provided the medical care without running to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.547" offset="7236671">They provided maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.898" offset="7242000">Then came Guevara, and Guevara decided for the first time there were no punitive damages, and now you have a growing problem in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.069" offset="7274705">You have a problem with shipowners providing less and less medical care without resort to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.456" offset="7296230">Now, our position here is that a seaman should be not ever have to come before a court to seek maintenance and cure, and the court should never, ever have to award punitive damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1868.136" offset="7578979">I mean, you should only plead punitive damages when you have a good faith basis for doing it; you believe you will survive a directed verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.825" offset="7609699">It should not be thrown in to every single complaint, and I'm not denying that some counsel will do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.646" offset="7633000">But what I'm saying is that today, in 2009, in 2006, there are actually shipowners who are, as a regular practice, denying their seamen medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.454" offset="7680230">I don't know why that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.837" offset="7685768">Perhaps it's because it is expensive now, more expensive than it has ever been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.322" offset="7699769">Perhaps it is because there are safety nets that will allow the seamen to seek Medicaid, and so the taxpayer will pay for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1940.566" offset="7868729">In the Fifth Circuit attorneys who regularly do maritime personal injury work tell each other -- we talk about the fact that you can't afford to represent somebody who's got a maintenance and cure case that's not combined with a Jones Act case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.158" offset="7923064">And there are a number of practical reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.360" offset="7931841">You have to pay all the experts, and it is very expensive to bring these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.645" offset="7948978">You have to hire the orthopedic surgeons, the -- the radiologists.</text>

            <text syncTime="1966.733" offset="7973428">And then, as an attorney, these are never recoverable as costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.168" offset="7987116">And then you are working on a contingent hourly fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.970" offset="7998297">If you win your case and you prove that they were willful, wanton and callous in -- in denying maintenance and cure, then you might get a portion of your attorneys' fees back.</text>

            <text syncTime="2162.126" offset="8754907">And -- and it could be asserted that maintenance and cure punitive damages were not necessary because the threat was enough to -- to require shipowners to go ahead and provide this.</text>

            <text syncTime="2185.592" offset="8848844">The leading scholar in this whole area is Professor Robertson at the University of Texas who wrote the AHA brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.080" offset="8874757">And his brief, on pages 7 through 11, catalogs the cases where he suggests punitive damages or exemplary damages were awarded for outrageous conduct involving failure to provide medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.489" offset="8928360">And I would suggest that those show that punitive damages were unexceptional before Vaughan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.059" offset="8950721">They were part of the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.093" offset="8958767">They -- they were before this Court in the Amiable Nancy, even though it didn't involve medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.880" offset="8977993">There is no reason to assume that if punitive damages are accepted in maritime law as part of the common law, that they weren't also accepted for the willful, wanton, egregious failure to provide a seaman with medical care.</text>

            <text syncTime="2930.121" offset="11826907">Justice Ginsburg, I wanted to respond first to a question that you asked that I think there may have been some confusion with respect to the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.631" offset="11885004">There is pain and suffering available in a maintenance and cure claim if the failure to pay the maintenance and cure causes injury, causes hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.022" offset="11938503">That's what we understand from reading the Osceola and the Iroquois as interpreted by Cortes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.294" offset="11971626">So, I didn't want you to be left with the impression that even if a maintenance and cure claim was brought by itself, if there's some injury, some damage beyond the failure to receive the maintenance and cure, there is a cause of action that could lead to, I think as you put it, the higher award and, hence, attorneys'--</text>

            <text syncTime="3023.565" offset="12200667">Justice Ginsburg, we're relying on Supreme Court precedent as opposed to anecdotal information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.170" offset="12239120">But to answer your question specifically, that's why I'm explaining that they do have the right to bring a personal injury component to a maintenance and cure claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.942" offset="12278199">And the other point I wanted to make, in the Ninth and Fifth Circuits those are the circuits of Guevara and Roy Al, where punitive damages have been clearly eliminated from a maintenance and cure claim for willful failure to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.619" offset="12332952">Since 1995 there's no dearth of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.488" offset="12348416">Those remain two of the most active circuits in the country for seamen's cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.177" offset="12375165">And whether they are filing as just maintenance and cure or combining with the Jones Act, the ratio would probably be the same as any other circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.199" offset="12411214">There was also a -- a question about the Vaughan and -- and what the dissent knew or didn't know; and -- and reference to McCormick on damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.590" offset="12460847">I think, again, it is -- it is a small point but it is interesting to point out that McCormick on damages, the same volume that the dissent referred to, specifically states that punitive damages are not available under FELA -- under the FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.767" offset="12525526">And, of course, the Jones Act incorporates FELA by reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.004" offset="12542454">Really the Vaughan dissent did not have the benefit of Miles when it reached its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.074" offset="12570770">If that court had had the benefit, we believe they would have found punitive damages are not available.</text>
