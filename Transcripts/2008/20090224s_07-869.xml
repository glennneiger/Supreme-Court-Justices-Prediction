            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">I have our opinion this morning in case 07-869, Ysursa versus Pocatello Education Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.700" offset="141291">Under Idaho law, a public employee may elect to have a portion of his wages deducted and remitted to his union to pay union dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.619" offset="176922">But Idaho law prohibits payroll deductions for political activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.179" offset="195208">So a public employee may not have a dues checkoff for the union's political action committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.611" offset="220912">A group of Idaho public employee unions sued, alleging that Idaho's ban on payroll deductions for political activities violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.422" offset="268142">The First Amendment prohibits government from "abridging the freedom of speech".</text>
            <text syncTime="46.289" offset="291652">Restrictions that single out a category of speech for disfavored treatment are presumptively invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.448" offset="320282">First Amendment does not, however, impose an obligation on government to subsidize speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.947" offset="342225">A State is therefore not required to assist others in funding the expression of particular ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.216" offset="371273">Idaho's law does not restrict political speech but rather declines to promote that speech by allowing public employee checkoffs for political activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.592" offset="412860">Idaho's public employee unions are free to engage in such speech as they see fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.294" offset="435639">They simply are barred from enlisting the State in support of that endeavor.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.462" offset="456328">Idaho's decision to limit public employee payroll deductions as it has does not infringe the unions' First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.194" offset="491227">The State accordingly need only demonstrate a rational basis to justify the ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.532" offset="516618">Idaho's justification is the interest in avoiding the reality or appearance of government favoritism or entanglement with partisan politics.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.937" offset="554235">And the State's response targets its source, political payroll deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.274" offset="575551">The ban plainly serves the State's interest in separating public employment from political activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.313" offset="603658">Now, the union say that whether or not all that is true, that only justifies the ban at the level of state employers not local government employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.626" offset="644932">But the same analysis applies whether the ban is directed at state or local government entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.435" offset="668233">Political subdivisions have never been considered sovereign entities but are instead subordinate governmental instrumentalities carrying out state governmental functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.852" offset="709820">Idaho's interest in separating the operation of government from parties and politics extends to all public employers at whatever level of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.886" offset="749944">Now, given the relationship between the State and its political subdivisions, it is immaterial how the State allocates funding or management responsibilities between the different levels of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.701" offset="797278">The First Amendment analysis does not vary depending on the level of government affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.762" offset="817445">The State is not required to promote political speech by allowing public employee checkoffs for political activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.226" offset="847329">The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.534" offset="860599">Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.879" offset="881915">Justice Breyer has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.134" offset="898947">And Justices Stevens and Souter have filed dissenting opinions.</text>
