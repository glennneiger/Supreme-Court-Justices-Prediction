            <text syncTime="6.481" offset="132409">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Three separate lines of double jeopardy analysis lead independently to the conclusion that the Double Jeopardy Clause commits the Ohio postconviction court to hold a hearing to determine whether Mr. Bies is mentally retarded for purposes of Atkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.473" offset="204298">First, there has been no acquittal in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.051" offset="214643">Second, there is no successive jeopardy; and, third, even if collateral estoppel analysis applies under Ashe versus Swenson, the Atkins issue has not actually and necessarily been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.406" offset="260096">Each of these factors shows that the Ohio court's decision to go forward with the Atkins hearing was reasonable, and this Court therefore should, consistent with AEDPA, give the Ohio courts their first chance to adjudicate Mr. Bies's Atkins claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.757" offset="317461">Much of the dispute in this case centers on the parties' disagreement over the meaning of Ashe versus Swenson and its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.177" offset="347136">But Mr. Bies cannot benefit from Ashe because Ashe -- the Ashe collateral estoppel rule only operates to benefit defendants who have in hand an earlier acquittal, and Mr. Bies has never been acquitted of the death penalty in any sense of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.062" offset="406695">This Court, beginning in Bullington and extending through Sattazahn, has defined an "acquittal" in a death penalty context as a finding by the sentencer that the death -- that the sentence of death is warranted in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.228" offset="463329">And the -- the jury and the trial judge in this case agreed that death was warranted, and, in fact, the Ohio Supreme Court and every reviewing court has agreed that death was warranted.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="98.070" offset="498751">But they all agreed that he was mentally retarded, and that was a mitigator.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.924" offset="534173">They all agreed to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.079" offset="546712">But assuming you're right on issue preclusion, what more -- the State says, yes, we recognize "mental retardation" means you can't administer the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.650" offset="617033">But what would the State show at an Atkins hearing that is not already in the record of this case?</text>

            <text syncTime="137.568" offset="656739">The reason to do it again, Your Honor, is because the -- the standard set forth by the Ohio Supreme Court in Lott when it was implementing this Court's decision in Atkins contained three definitions -- three elements of the Atkins definition, of the definition of "mental retardation".</text>
            <text syncTime="153.794" offset="721627">And those three elements were not carefully demonstrated by Dr. Winter.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.309" offset="739704">And, in fact, the -- the record here -- the Ohio post-conviction court has concluded -- doesn't suffice to make the post-Atkins Lott determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.618" offset="776903">The -- at pages 101a to 104a of the Petition Appendix, the State postconviction court looks at all the evidence, including Dr. Winter's testimony, and says that there needs to be a hearing where experts will be called in order to determine whether Mr. Bies not only suffers from significant intellectual limitations, which includes IQ, but there is conflicting IQ evidence in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.294" offset="875645">It also includes findings that he suffers from substantial limitations in adaptive skills, the skills needed for daily life, which Dr. Winter never specifically spoke about.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.855" offset="913889">She spoke only about IQ when she was talking about mental retardation.</text>

            <text syncTime="212.771" offset="957565">Suppose that in a jury case the jury -- pre-Atkins, the jury says, we find that the defendant has a 65 IQ, but that in light of the heinous nature of the offense, this is not a mitigating factor, and that he should be sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.572" offset="1036769">In a subsequent Atkins proceeding, can the jury finding with reference to the IQ be conclusive?</text>

            <text syncTime="250.144" offset="1106986">It can be reopened for two reasons, one relating to the definition of "mental retardation" post-Atkins and the other relating to the different issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.221" offset="1135303">First, with respect to the definition, the Ohio Supreme Court has made clear in Lott that IQ is not enough to determine mental retardation.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.293" offset="1167590">In fact, the -- the clinicians and the American Association of Mental Retardation say that IQ is not enough, particularly in a borderline case where IQ is close to the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.445" offset="1216178">And there you need to look very carefully at adaptive skills.</text>

            <label>Mr. Benjamin C. Mizer</label>
            <text syncTime="302.686" offset="1317219">--And the answer to that is no, Your Honor, for issue preclusive purposes, because the issue is completely different in the mitigation context from the post-Atkins context.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.119" offset="1354940">And I think that difference is highlighted by the difference between Penry and Atkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.510" offset="1372494">Pre-Atkins what the sentencer was talking about, the jury and then the Ohio Supreme Court when it affirmed, was what this Court told it to talk about in Penry.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.303" offset="1407707">It was talking about mental retardation as a mitigating factor, and the State of Ohio and the Ohio courts had no definition of "mental retardation" pre-Atkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.392" offset="1443965">In fact, I think if there had been a definition and if the courts had excluded evidence from the jury that didn't rise to a certain level of severity, then we would have run into a -- a post -- a Penry and Tennard problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.775" offset="1497569">And so all of the evidence was allowed in, and it was treated as mitigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.260" offset="1515436">And so what the Ohio Supreme Court was doing was what Penry told it to do: Considering mitigating evidence of mental retardation.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.175" offset="1539156">But post-Atkins the inquiries are different, because Atkins effectively constitutionalized a clinical judgment in making -- in defining a categorical bar on executing the mentally retarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.219" offset="1591296">And so post-Atkins it is necessary to be very careful about the clinical judgment, and this record does not suffice for that clinical judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.525" offset="1624524">And I think it -- think it does not behoove either party to suggest that the record--</text>

            <text syncTime="398.316" offset="1699756">I grant you that under -- under the earlier case the 65 IQ was not dispositive, and I mean that was the -- the case in Justice Kennedy's hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.829" offset="1733716">But it was necessary under the early case to come to a determination of what the IQ was, even though that determination was not dispositive of the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.542" offset="1776661">And because it was necessary to come to a determination, why shouldn't there be a preclusion?</text>

            <text syncTime="524.290" offset="2203606">That's correct, Your Honor, but there wasn't at the time a -- a great deal of incentive to litigate that question because the Ohio Supreme Court had said that mental retardation only merited some weight in mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.725" offset="2249373">And, in fact, the -- the appellate briefs on direct review are in the Joint Appendix and -- excerpts of those briefs.</text>

            <text syncTime="559.824" offset="2345712">And so none of the parties thought that mental retardation in 1992 through 1996 was very persuasive, because the courts didn't treat it and the jury didn't treat it as very persuasive, Perhaps for the reasons that this Court underscored in Atkins, where the Court said that, as it had said in Penry, that mental retardation evidence presented to a jury in mitigation could be a two-edged sword, because some jurors might perceive and the prosecutor might argue that that evidence went to future dangerousness, and therefore the -- the State of Ohio argued that the mental retardation evidence here was simply not persuasive and it was outweighed by the -- the aggravating factors that the jury had found.</text>

            <text syncTime="955.585" offset="3928733">With respect to your question about due process or -- or other rules aside from due process, it's possible that the State could have more expansive common law or State law interpretations of the collateral estoppel rules, and maybe those would benefit the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.235" offset="3995397">This Court in -- in the Hoag case declined to use due process to incorporate collateral estoppel rules constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.246" offset="4035417">So in your case the defendant would only be left with the hope that the State would have more expansive collateral estoppel rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.528" offset="4060599">But to return to Ashe, the defendant here is claiming that he is entitled to a constitutionalized version of collateral estoppel because of Ashe, but he's not entitled to that protection because Ashe applies only where a defendant has previously been acquitted, and he has not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.241" offset="4119427">It also applies only in a case where the defendant is facing a successive jeopardy of some sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.534" offset="4144609">Now, Mr. Bies's sentence is -- is surely at issue in this case, but it's at issue in the sense that it would be at issue in, say, a direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.577" offset="4180762">It's only -- there has only been one prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1054.063" offset="4322659">We agree that that's exhausted because in the Ohio courts it is not permissible to take an interlocutory appeal when a double jeopardy claim has been denied, as it was in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.152" offset="4367067">And so we are fine with the Sixth Circuit precedent that holds that in that case the Federal courts can act in habeas to prevent exposure to a double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.196" offset="4403221">We simply maintain that there is no second jeopardy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.772" offset="4417536">But the Atkins claim itself is unexhausted, and the Federal magistrate that first dealt with this case in Federal Court held that it was unexhausted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2435.546" offset="9848602">Second, on appeal, by not contesting the evidence -- the State of Ohio did contest it here -- you ran the risk that the Ohio Court of Appeals or the Ohio Supreme Court would reach a different conclusion, number one, on the balance of aggravation and mitigation; or, number two, on whether the death sentence was disproportion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2458.115" offset="9938881">But here also, right, you had not only the direct appeal and the findings, but you have additional findings and concessions in State postconviction, where Mr. Bies goes in in State postconviction, and he raises a pre-Atkins categorical bar claim, and says I'm a person with mental retardation; since this Court's decision in Penry, things have changed; and I believe my death sentence is disproportionate under the Ohio and the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.479" offset="10048387">In response to that, the State, number one, conceded mental retardation and said we agree the record reveals Mr. Bies is a person with mental retardation, and the postconviction court then enters a finding of fact.</text>

            <label>Mr. Benjamin C. Mizer</label>
            <text syncTime="2872.598" offset="11596821">First, with respect to the judicial estoppel arguments and the State's purported concessions, as Justice Ginsburg noted, the statement to which Mr. Bies points was pre-Atkins, and Mr. Bies's argument ignores that Atkins changed things in two ways: one consequential, by enacting, by placing a categorical bar on the States; and the second, definitional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.352" offset="11707894">So for the reasons stated of our -- in our yellow brief at pages 16 to 18, the judicial estoppel argument fails for all kinds of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.489" offset="11740390">But more to the point, judicial estoppel shouldn't apply here also because the State, whatever it was saying at the time, was not talking about the three-part post-Atkins definition of mental retardation in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.656" offset="11789082">Mr. Bies also argues that 2254(d)(2) is enough to give support to -- to the Sixth Circuit's grant of relief -- of relief here, but there are two problems with that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.182" offset="11839133">The first problem is that the Sixth Circuit disregarded the reasonable determination by the State's postconviction court that the Atkins standard had never been applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.820" offset="11877689">The second problem is that we shouldn't even get to 2254(d)(2) because there are legal problems with the Sixth Circuit's reasoning that should have prevented it from granting the writ under 2254(d)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.797" offset="11933592">Mr. Bies argues that there is not a legal problem because there was an acquittal in this case, because the Ohio Supreme Court's statement on direct review that Mr. Bies -- that Mr. Bies's mild to borderline mental retardation merits weight and mitigation was enough to entitle him to a life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.526" offset="12000569">But that's not an acquittal, and it's a severe distortion of what this Court said in Sattazahn about an acquittal.</text>
