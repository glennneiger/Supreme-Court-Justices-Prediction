            <text syncTime="8.856" offset="141918">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit's affirmance of a nationwide injunction in this case is contrary to bedrock principles of Article III standing, of the availability and scope of judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act, and the granting of equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.733" offset="217360">As this case was decided by the district court and as it comes to this Court, it involves a stand-alone challenge to two regulations that govern the procedures to be followed by the Forest Service in deciding whether to approve individual site-specific activities in national forests.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.528" offset="288517">The two regulations provide that site-specific actions that are excluded from either an environmental impact requirement or even an EA under NEPA are also not subject to special noticing and comment and administrative appeal provisions applicable to the Forest Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.839" offset="365840">The Ninth Circuit sustained the district court's nationwide injunction as to those procedural regulations standing alone, not as part of a challenge to a specific site-specific activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.714" offset="409307">The court did so, moreover, on the basis of an affidavit from one member of one of the organizations who could not begin to establish standing under this Court's decisions by showing an imminent injury by virtue of harm to a site-specific activity; and the Court affirmed the nationwide injunction applicable to all forests with respect to all projects listed in ten categories identified by the district court, including national forests and projects that don't even -- that are not even included within that one declarant's generalized interests in certain natural forests.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.820" offset="553712">For the multiple combination -- combination of multiple reasons, we think the Ninth Circuit's decision cannot stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.076" offset="586731">First, as with respect to standing, the one declaration on which both the district court and the court of appeals rely is the declaration of Mr. Bensman, which is reproduced in the petition appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.336" offset="643783">And on page 70A and 71A are the only allegations of -- that go to injury at all with respect to the particular regulations at issue here from paragraph 15 on to -- the bottom of 71A on, those are allegations concerning other regulations that are no longer at issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="156.849" offset="733853">Suppose -- I mean, Congress here has passed a statute and the statute specifically aims at a class of litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.022" offset="766558">And it says to the class of litigants, if you are a member of it, we are telling you what we want the agency to do and that is to promulgate a certain appeal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.544" offset="800622">Now, if you are a member of the class that frequently litigates and you frequently take advantage of that procedure, why aren't you heard as a litigant, at least enough for Article III?</text>
            <text syncTime="185.018" offset="846493">And we know as far as prudential standing is concerned, Congress wanted to give you standing, so I think would it take care of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.041" offset="878571">Are you saying no matter -- that just normal litigants in the courts who reappear time and time again in certain kinds of cases, don't have standing to challenge a procedural rule, if Congress under Article III and Congress specifically tells them they can?</text>

            <text syncTime="266.320" offset="1171769">Procedural wrong is not Article III injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.041" offset="1186607">The injury in this case comes from the application of the regulation in a specific site-specific--</text>

            <text syncTime="291.454" offset="1272289">But I would be amazed if the lawyers at that time or the clients who had certain cases were not permitted to challenge those rules as contrary to some other rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.825" offset="1521706">In the Whitman case the court says that the statutes providing for direct review of regulations eliminate prudential limitations on ripeness in that case, but they wouldn't eliminate the bedrock principle of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.919" offset="1582101">It would be necessary to show a threatened injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="372.704" offset="1597252">Mr. Kneedler, don't we have to assess the need for -- for showing a specific threatened injury on a -- on a somewhat elastic standard in a case like this?</text>
            <text syncTime="384.762" offset="1645526">Because the claim is made on the other side that if we do not allow, if we do not find standing to challenge the regulation per se, there are going to be a number of specific instances which in practical terms can never be challenged when that regulation is applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.787" offset="1713549">There were one or two instances, as I recall, of cases in which on your theory there could be no challenge because the announcement of the action was made on the very date that the action was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.649" offset="1781049">So that if we do not find sufficient elasticity and standing to allow a challenge to the regulation on behalf of people of the sort that Justice Breyer described, there will, in fact, be a preclusion of any challenge to a lot of specific actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2867.897" offset="11578013">Now, the agency promulgates a procedural regulation that hurts those people who normally have a concrete injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3502.745" offset="14117428">--ripeness under the APA but it ties in -- it ties into the injunctive relief if I just could address that for the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.800" offset="14145640">Injunctive relief is -- is discretionary and Section 702 of the APA says nothing in the statute limit a court's ability to deny relief on appropriate equitable grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.524" offset="14200498">And this is best illustrated by the -- suppose a regulation was challenged by the defendant in a criminal conviction and the plaintiff says the regulation is invalid on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.666" offset="14241144">The APA says set it aside, but surely the district court dismissing that indictment would not be setting aside the regulation on a nationwide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.688" offset="14277193">The effect of a declaratory judgment even one rendered in the course of dismissing an indictment, if you call that a declaration, is -- is governed by the law of judgments, not by -- not by a court reaching out and extending its ruling to people and forests and projects that are not before -- not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.066" offset="14350754">And the Burnt Ridge Project shows the way in which this could be challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.435" offset="14368204">A particular project where there was not an appeal, if someone wants to object to the project on that ground or any other ground, he -- he can challenge that project, and there may be other grounds on which that project might be invalid which is an additional reason not to anticipate a legal defect but to -- but to wait until it's applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.015" offset="14454512">The final thing I wanted to say is about the claim of procedural injury and that this might be like FOIA or something like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.752" offset="14481471">I think it's instructive that the -- that the ARA is not written in terms of conferring rights on individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.339" offset="14507802">It's a direction to the Forest Service to prepare a -- to establish an appeal mechanism, in other words, do what the agency normally does to establish procedures for administering things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.082" offset="14558793">There is certainly nothing in the text that suggests that it was intended to confer the extraordinary sort of right of immediate access to the court for purely procedural grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.272" offset="14599544">It was just meant to fine-tune the agency's own internal administrative procedures, which Section 706 of the APA makes clear can only be challenged in a challenge to the final agency action in which the procedures are applied.</text>
